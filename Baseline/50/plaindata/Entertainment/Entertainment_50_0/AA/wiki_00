Examples include \"So Long Dearie\" from \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"Rose's Turn\" from \"Gypsy\", and \"Work the Wound\" from \"Passing Strange\". It was so named because in the days when musical performances would start at 8:30 pm, this song would occur around 11:00 pm.\n\nAmong the theatre community, there is some debate as to the characteristics of an 11 o'clock number. It often signifies a moment of revelation or change in heart of a lead character, although there are exceptions to this. The 11 o'clock number is also differentiated from the finale in that it is not the final number in the show, but even this is not considered a requirement by some commenters.\n\nOther notable 11 o'clock numbers include \"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\" from \"Guys and Dolls\", \"Memory\" from \"Cats\", \"Brotherhood of Man\" from \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", \"Gimme Gimme\" from \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", \"Another National Anthem\" from \"Assassins\", \"The American Dream\" from \"Miss Saigon\", \"I'm Here\" from \"The Color Purple\", and \"Always Starting Over\" from \"If/Then\".\n"}

After the Greater Berlin Act the city became the third largest municipality in the world and experienced its heyday as a major world city. It was known for its leadership roles in science, the humanities, music, film, higher education, government, diplomacy, industries and military affairs.\n\nThe Weimar Republic era began in the midst of several major movements in the fine arts. German Expressionism had begun before World War I and continued to have a strong influence throughout the 1920s, although artists were increasingly likely to position themselves in opposition to expressionist tendencies as the decade went on.\n\nA sophisticated, innovative culture developed in and around Berlin, including highly developed architecture and design (Bauhaus, 1919–33), a variety of literature (Döblin, \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\", 1929), film (Lang, \"Metropolis\", 1927, Dietrich, \"Der blaue Engel\", 1930), painting (Grosz), and music (Brecht and Weill, \"The Threepenny Opera\", 1928), criticism (Benjamin), philosophy/psychology (Jung), and fashion. This culture was often considered to be decadent and socially disruptive by rightists.\n\nFilm was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called German Expressionism. \"Talkies\", the sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.\n\nThe so-called \"mystical arts\" also experienced a revival during this time-period in Berlin, with astrology, the occult, and esoteric religions and off-beat religious practices becoming more mainstream and acceptable to the masses as they entered popular culture.\n\nBerlin in the 1920s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood, who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play \"I Am a Camera\", which was later adapted into a musical, \"Cabaret\", and an Academy Award winning film of the same name. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel \"The Temple\" evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the time.\n\nThe University of Berlin (today \"Humboldt University of Berlin\") became a major intellectual centre in Germany, Europe, and the World. The sciences were especially favored — from 1914 to 1933.\n\nAlbert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. He served as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, only leaving after the anti-Semitic Nazi Party rose to power.\n\nPhysician Magnus Hirschfeld established the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) in 1919, and it remained open until 1933. Hirschfeld believed that an understanding of homosexuality could be arrived at through science. Hirschfeld was a vocal advocate for homosexual, bisexual, and transgender legal rights for men and women, repeatedly petitioning parliament for legal changes. His Institute also included a museum.\n\nPolitically, Berlin was seen as a left wing stronghold, with the Nazis calling it \"the reddest city [in Europe] after Moscow.\" Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels became his party's \"Gauleiter\" for Berlin in the autumn of 1926 and had only been in charge a week before organizing a march through a communist-sympathizing area that devolved into a street riot. The communists, who adopted the motto \"Beat the fascists wherever you encounter them!\" had their own paramilitary organization called the Roter Frontkämpferbund to battle the Nazis' Sturmabteilung (SA). In February 1927 the Nazis held a meeting in the \"Red\" stronghold of Wedding that turned into a violent brawl. \"Beer glasses, chairs and tables flew through the hall, and severely injured people were left lying covered with blood on the floor. Despite the injuries, it was a triumph for Goebbels, whose followers beat up about 200 communists and drove them from the hall.\"\n\nThe government began printing tremendous amounts of currency to pay reparations; this caused staggering inflation that destroyed middle-class savings. However, economic expansion resumed after mid-decade, aided by U.S. loans. It was then that culture blossomed especially.\n\nThe heyday of Berlin began in the mid-1920s when it was the most industrialized city of the continent. Tempelhof Airport was opened in 1923 and a start was made on S-Bahn electrification from 1924 onwards. Berlin was also the second biggest inland harbor of Germany; all of this infrastructure was needed to transport and feed the over 4 million Berliners throughout the 1920s.\n\nDuring the interwar period high-quality architecture was built on a large scale in Berlin for broad sections of the population, including poorer people. In particular the Berlin Modernism housing estates built before the beginning of National Socialism set standards worldwide and therefore have been added to the UNESCO World-heritage list in 2008.\n\nAs a result of the economically difficult situation during the Weimar Republic, housing construction, which up to that time had been mainly privately financed and profit-oriented, had found itself at a dead end. Inflation was on the up and for citizens on low incomes decent housing was becoming increasingly unaffordable.\n\nConsequently, the search was on to find new models for state-initiated housing construction, which could then be implemented with a passion from 1920 on following the creation of Greater Berlin and the accompanying reform of local and regional government. The requirements for the type of flats to be built and the facilities they were to have were clearly defined, and the city was divided into different building zones. Following some basic ideas of the Garden city movement two- to three-storey housing estates that were well integrated into the landscape of the suburbs of the city were planned. The first large estate of this type with more than 2,000 residential units was the so-called \"Hufeisensiedlung\" (Horseshoe Estate) designed by Bruno Taut in Berlin, which introduced a new type of high quality housing and became a prominent example for the use of colors in architecture.\n\nProstitution rose in Berlin and elsewhere in the areas of Europe left ravaged by World War I. This means of survival for desperate women, and sometimes men, became normalized to a degree in the 1920s. During the war, venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea spread at a rate that warranted government attention. Soldiers at the front contracted these diseases from prostitutes, so the German army responded by granting approval to certain brothels that were inspected by their own medical doctors, and soldiers were rationed coupon books for sexual services at these establishments. Homosexual behaviour was also documented among soldiers at the front. Soldiers returning to Berlin at the end of the War had a different attitude towards their own sexual behaviour than they had a few years previously. Prostitution was frowned on by respectable Berliners, but it continued to the point of becoming entrenched in the city's underground economy and culture. First women with no other means of support turned to the trade, then youths of both genders.\n\nCrime in general developed in parallel with prostitution in the city, beginning as petty thefts and other crimes linked to the need to survive in the war's aftermath. Berlin eventually acquired a reputation as a hub of drug dealing (cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers) and the black market. The police identified 62 organized criminal gangs in Berlin, called \"Ringvereine\". The German public also became fascinated with reports of homicides, especially \"lust murders\" or \"Lustmord\". Publishers met this demand with inexpensive criminal novels called \"Krimi\", which like the film noir of the era (such as the classic \"M\"), explored methods of scientific detection and psychosexual analysis.\n\nApart from the new tolerance for behaviour that was technically still illegal, and viewed by a large part of society as immoral, there were other developments in Berlin culture that shocked many visitors to the city. Thrill-seekers came to the city in search of adventure, and booksellers sold many editions of guide books to Berlin's erotic night entertainment venues. There were an estimated 500 such establishments, that included a large number of homosexual venues for men and for lesbians; sometimes transvestites of one or both genders were admitted, otherwise there were at least 5 known establishments that were exclusively for a transvestite clientele. There were also several nudist venues. Berlin also had a museum of sexuality during the Weimar period, at Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute of Sexology. These were nearly all closed when the Nazi regime became a dictatorship in 1933.\n\nArtists in Berlin became fused with the city's underground culture as the borders between cabaret and legitimate theatre blurred. Anita Berber, a dancer and actress, became notorious throughout the city and beyond for her erotic performances (as well as her cocaine addiction and erratic behaviour). She was painted by Otto Dix, and socialized in the same circles as Klaus Mann.\n\n1920s Berlin was a city of many social contrasts. While a large part of the population continued to struggle with high unemployment and deprivations in the aftermath of World War I, the upper class of society, and a growing middle class, gradually rediscovered prosperity and turned Berlin into a cosmopolitan city. \n\nCinema in Weimar culture did not shy away from controversial topics, but dealt with them explicitly. \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" (1929) directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst and starring Louise Brooks, deals with a young woman who is thrown out of her home after having an illegitimate child, and is then forced to become a prostitute to survive. This trend of dealing frankly with provocative material in cinema began immediately after the end of the War. In 1919, Richard Oswald directed and released two films, that met with press controversy and action from police vice investigators and government censors. \"Prostitution\" dealt with women forced into \"white slavery\", while \"Different from the Others\" dealt with a homosexual man's conflict between his sexuality and social expectations. By the end of the decade, similar material met with little, if any opposition when it was released in Berlin theatres. William Dieterle's \"Sex in Chains\" (1928), and Pabst's \"Pandora's Box\" (1929) deal with homosexuality among men and women, respectively, and were not censored. Homosexuality was also present more tangentially in other films from the period.\n\nThe following significant films about 1920s Berlin show the metropolis between 1920 and 1933:\n\n\n\"See also:\" List of films set in Berlin\n\n\n"}

Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, auditions, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.\n\nThere are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill. \nSpecialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is Dewar Studios in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.\n\n"}

The Avenue of Stars was a walkway through Covent Garden passing St Paul's Church, commonly known as the \"Actors' Church\". It honoured individuals or groups from the entertainment industry with notable achievements. As on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the individual or group was represented by a five-pointed star containing the name set into the walkway.

{"id": "262807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262807", "title": "Ceroc", "text": "Ceroc\n\nCeroc is an international dance club which has with over 200 venues across the UK as well as national and regional competitions and weekend events throughout the year. It also has franchises in many other countries in Europe, Asia and the antipodes.\n\nThe name 'Ceroc' is said to derive from the French \"C'est le roc\" (it's roc), used to describe rock n' roll dancing in France.\n\nCeroc was created in London, England, by James Cronin, the son of writer Vincent Cronin, and grandson of Scottish author A. J. Cronin. In January 1980 he held the first ever Ceroc event in Porchester Hall in London. By 1982, Ceroc had a cabaret team that performed routines in London nightclubs and venues. Throughout the spring and summer of 1982, the Ceroc troupe worked with choreographer Michel Ange Lau, whose classes Cronin and Sylvia Coleman had attended at the Centre Charles Peguy, a French youth centre, in Leicester Square. The first video recording of a Ceroc event appears on the description for the \"Gold Bug\" routine, performed at the 1982 Ceroc Ball, a charity event, at the Hammersmith Palais.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cronin and Sylvia Coleman created Ceroc Enterprises, registered Ceroc as a trademark and started to sell Ceroc franchises around the country. In 1992, the Ceroc Teachers Association (CTA) was created, with associated examinations – all Ceroc teachers had to pass the relevant CTA examinations to be licensed to teach at Ceroc events. In 1994, Ceroc introduced 'taxi dancers' to their venues – volunteers who are experienced dancers, designated to assist beginners.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Cronin and Coleman sold Ceroc Enterprises to Mike Ellard, the current owner. By 2004, Ceroc Enterprises were running over 100 different venues, and claimed attendance figures of 500,000. In 2006, Ceroc started expanding into the \"Weekender\" market.\n\nAs of 2008, Ceroc Enterprises has franchises operating in Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, the UAE, Canada, the United States and Hong Kong. As of September 2008, there are over 30 Ceroc franchises running in the United Kingdom and 150 Ceroc venues there. There are also Ceroc organizations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa and Dubai.\n\nApart from the franchises described above, there are Ceroc organisations in Australia and New Zealand. Ceroc Enterprises is a separate company to \"Ceroc Australia\" and \"Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company\" or CMJ (also based in Australia). These Australian companies are not franchisees of Ceroc Enterprises. Similarly, there is no legal connection between Ceroc Enterprises and \"Ceroc New Zealand\". In November 2013 'Ceroc Australia' was sold to 'Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company\" or CMJ to bring them both back under the same umbrella since they split in 1998.\n\nOutside of the Ceroc Franchise, the dance style Modern Jive is also taught and danced in many independent venues, where it is commonly called LeRoc. Originally it was the same dance style taught in Ceroc venues and independents, but these have diverged enormously over the last 20 years. However, dancers who have learned at either Ceroc venues or independents can dance together in freestyle, as underneath stylistic differences it is fundamentally the same dance. Ceroc franchise venues often attract a younger demographic than independents, largely because of their branding and that they often recruit younger teachers, however this is by no means ubiquitous.\n\nIn 1990, Robert Austin, an original Ceroc franchisee who had broken away from Ceroc to form LeJive, coined the term \"Modern Jive\". \"Modern Jive\" is a generic term for the dance form, and is used by teachers and clubs that are not affiliated to Ceroc Enterprise. Ceroc does not recognise the term “Modern Jive”, and Ceroc’s web site states that it teaches dance in general and not a specific dance form.\n\nMost Ceroc venues run regular classes, every week, usually on Monday through Thursdays.\n\nCeroc class formats are quite different from most other dance forms, in that:\n\nIn the UK, the franchise nature of Ceroc enforces a degree of uniformity across all teachers and all venues. Ceroc classes typically follow the same format, and comprise:\n\nThe start time varies from venue to venue, but is generally between 7pm and 8pm. Sunday classes often start earlier. Whatever the start time, the entire evening lasts three to four hours in most venues (with rare exceptions).\n\nA \"Beginner Progression\" class (also known variously as \"Bridging\", \"Beginner Consolidation\", \"Intromediate\" or \"Freestyle class\" ) taught at the same time as the \"Intermediate\" or \"Intermediate/Advanced\" class has also been introduced in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide, involving a breakdown of technique and either a review of the preceding \"Beginner\" class (possibly with some extensions or variations to the moves from that class) or a new routine drawn from a mixture of intermediate and beginner level moves . This class is taught at the same time as the \"Intermediate\" class.\n\nIndividual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the Intermediate classes, however there is generally a stronger focus on technique (footwork, frame & connection, balance etc.), intermediate skills (dips & drops, leans, spinning etc.) and styling rather than just teaching \"moves\".\n\nA video clip of a Ceroc class filmed in Melbourne can be seen at Mind Body & Soul\n\nMost Australian schools teach \"Step\" footwork. See Modern Jive#Step footwork vs Rock footwork\n\nIn New Zealand there are typically \"Beginners,\" \"Intermediate\" and \"Advanced\" classes, with the clearer separation of moves between the classes. Moving up the classes leads to moves which are more complicated, more syncopated and physically closer. Beginners moves have 2-4 timing, preserve contact between partners at all times, have single speed, single turn spins, the dancers keep their balance (no leans, drops or dips) and partners only contact with each other is hands, arms and shoulders. Intermediate moves introduce single speed double spins and assisted double speed turns, contact with the partners back, and leans (in which one partner takes the others' weight with their body). Advanced moves can include multiple speed, multiple turn spins, loss of contact, significant syncopation, dips and drops (in which one partner takes the weight of the other with their arms) and/or contact with different body parts.\n\nAs well as regular class nights, most Ceroc franchises put on special events, termed 'Freestyles', on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Sunday freestyles are termed 'tea dances' and are often held in the afternoon rather than evening. Some freestyle events begin with an 'icebreaker' class, usually at an intermediate level as beginners are unlikely to attend freestyles.\n\nA typical Saturday night freestyle would begin at either 8pm or 9pm and run until between 12midnight and 2am. Freestyles are usually held at larger venues such as town halls, and often have two rooms: the Main Room, usually the largest room playing up tempo music between 100 and 150BPM; and often a 'Blues Room' or 'Chillout' room, playing slower music between 80 and 110BPM, allowing for slower dancing focusing more on connection, interpretation and musicality.\n\nMany Ceroc teachers also occasionally run daytime dance workshops at weekends, which in the UK are known as Cerocshops. A workshop lasts for four hours, and covers more moves than are covered in a single regular evening class. The standard Ceroc workshops are graded (\"Beginners 1\", \"Beginners 2\", \"Beginners Plus\", \"Intermediate 1\", \"Intermediate 2\", and \"Intermediate Plus\").\nSpecialised workshops may also be available which cover more advanced techniques and styles such as \"Dips & Drops\", \"Baby Aerials\", \"Double Trouble\" (one lead, two follows), \"Switch it Up\" (swapping partners), \"Ceroc to Blues\", \"Footwork\", \"Frame\", \"Spins & Turn technique\", \"Musicality\", \"Connection & Posture\". The frequency and content of these workshops depends on the resident teacher or guest teachers who may teach various workshops over the course of a weekend often with a freestyle party in the evening such as Ceroc Aberdeen's Beach Ballroom Weekend or Ceroc Conexion's Extreme Mini Weekender.\n\nCeroc Enterprises holds an annual UK Ceroc dance championship. This is held in London (currently at the Watford Colosseum) at the beginning of May with a mix of freestyle dancing and competitions. Competitions range from beginner oriented categories, such as the Lucky Dip (a Jack and Jill competition) and 'Ceroc X' where competitors are restricted to a set list of 8 basic moves, which they have to dance to different musical styles and are judged on performance and musicality.\n\nIn recent years, the Intermediate and Advanced Freestyle Categories have been merged into an All Stars category divided into three different age brackets. Above this there is still the Open category, and Top Cats, another Jack and Jill where individual competitors are judged rather than couples. Other categories include Aerials, Showcase, and Team Cabaret competitions.\n\nThere are other championships held on a regional or franchise basis, for example the Midlands, Ceroc Scotland and Welsh champs, and the Australasian.\n\nCeroc also hosts the European Neo-Blues Championships. This is held at the weekender 'Breeze' at the Pontins at Brean Sands in October, and includes an invitational Masters Jack and Jill, Blues Open, Blues DWAS, and Showcase categories.\n\nCeroc hosts a number of 'Ceroc Escape' dance weekenders throughout the year, attracting hundreds of dancers from around the UK and Europe. Most of these take place at the Pontins holiday resorts at Camber Sands, Southport and Somerset. Other more luxurious weekenders are held at hotels, such as LUX and Swish. Freestyle dancing begins on the Friday night and carries on through until the Monday morning. During the day a range classes and workshops are available with teachers from around the country. Most events have a Saturday night cabaret, featuring teachers showcase, competition, and showcase performances.\n\nIn 2005, Ceroc Enterprises completed the purchase of Rebel Roc, along with its annual dance weekender event at Pontins, Camber Sands. The first such event under the ownership of Ceroc Enterprises was Ceroc \"Storm\" at Camber Sands in March 2006. Ceroc Enterprises has been expanding its weekender offerings, and has taken over weekender venues from JiveTime (Camber Sands) at the end of 2007, and Jive Addiction (Southport) in August 2008.\n\n\n"}

It is typically performed at birthday parties, churches, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday Schools or libraries. It is often the only type of magic most Westerners experience other than that seen on television. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature.\n\nA distinction should be made between Children's magic and \"young magicians.\" The former is meant for audiences made up of mostly children while the latter refers to performers who are under-aged. The later has organizations dedicated to them including Society of Young Magicians, Magic Youth International and Young Magicians' Club.\n\nNot every magician is interested in performing for children both artistically and in terms of patience. When Br. John Hamman, sm, was honored in 1995 during the first St. Louis Magical Heritage Awards, he explained in his acceptance speech the key to a successful magic performance:\n\nSince children do not have the social filters adults have in such situations, they have no compunction against pointing out every error or inconsistency a magician makes during his performance. This makes performing for children exceedingly difficult.\n\nChildren's magicians often use certain gambits while performing for children. Some performers use their knowledge to intentionally misdirect the children in a given audience. One form of this type of misdirection is referred to as \"Magician-in-Trouble\" wherein a performer pretends to have made a mistake.\n\nThe style used for children's magic is often comical and frequently uses props that are large and colorful.\nIt is not uncommon for magicians to dress as clowns or in wild and outlandish costumes while performing.\n\nGenerally, children's magicians are reluctant to use tricks that focus on the use of playing cards, however magic with coins (see Coin magic) or paper money are frequently popular with children. Movement and action are preferable to patter. Buffoonery is a better vehicle than \"mystery\" for children.[1] These performers commonly use as many audience members as impromptu assistants as possible.[1] Common Children's Magic Props include: Run Rabbit Run, Hip Hop Rabbits, Change Bag Routines, Breakaway Wand, Tipsy Turvy Bottles, and Spongeballs. Older children (from 7 upwards) tend to have a far greater logic and less traditional and more innovative magic effects can be performed.\n"}

The climax of a story is a literary element.\n\nThe punch line of a joke is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any falling action is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of humor as opposed to the nature of drama.\n\nIn non-fictional narrative genres, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and \"plot\" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.\n\nIn the play \"Hippolytus\", by the famous Greek playwright, Euripides, the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that Aphrodite's curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.\n\nAn anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, \"Emergency Self-Destruct\", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of \"The War of the Worlds\", where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet Earth, the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.\n\n"}

{"id": "3938188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3938188", "title": "Color guard (flag spinning)", "text": "Color guard (flag spinning)\n\nColor guards can be found in most American colleges, universities, high schools, and middle schools, and independent drum corps. They typically consist of girls but may include boys as well. They use various equipment, including flags, rifles, and sabres, along with dance, to enhance the music of the marching band show. They perform using their facially expressions and connections to the audience and dancing to enhance the meaning and feeling of their show. Usually, marching bands and color guards perform during football games at halftime. During marching band competitions, the guard adds to the overall score of the band and is also judged in a category usually called auxiliary.\n\nColor guards have since evolved into a separate activity known as winter guard, which is an indoor sport usually performed during the winter or spring, where the guard performs unaccompanied by the band to a piece of pre-recorded music indoors. Winter guards compete independently in such circuits as Winter Guard International (WGI) and Tournament Indoor Association (TIA), or Keystone Indoor Drill Association (KIDA).\n\nThere is only one nationally recognized color sorority in the United States. Phi Rho Psi National Color Guard Sorority was founded in 2009 at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. More information on Phi Rho Psi can be found at their website.\n\nIn a marching band or a drum and bugle corps, the color guard is a non-musical section that provides additional visual aspects to the performance. The marching band and color guard performance generally takes place on a football field. The color guard performs alongside the marching band at football games and most guards regularly compete in competitions during the fall. The purpose of the color guard is to interpret the music that the marching band or drum and bugle corps is playing via the synchronized work of flags, sabres, rifles, the air blade, and through dance. The color guard uses different colors and styles of flags like swing flags and tapered flags to enhance the visual effect of the marching band as a whole. Color guard also may use backdrops to bring color and scenery to the field if the concept of the show is hard to interpret. The number of members in a color guard can range from a single person to over 50 members. This is often dependent on the size of the band, school or corps, the allotted budget, and the talent available among the potential members who try out.\n\nIn drum and bugle corps, there used to be a requirement for a traditional presentation of the colors during the competitive show (called the \"Color Pre\"), but this fell out of favor around the early 1970s. High school marching bands kept it in until the late 70's. A recent example of a Color Pre in show was the 2002 San Francisco Renegades Sr corps, used during \"America the Beautiful\" to open their program, but such a presentation was not a required part of the show.\n\nThere are many different types of spins and tosses that can be done with the flag. Each spin or toss creates a different illusion and can be used for different tempos. Basic color guard moves include Jazz runs (a Jazz dance move used as a graceful way to run across the marching band field or the gym floor), \"right shoulder\" (positioning the flag with the bottom of the pole by your belly button and your right hand by the flag's silk tape) and \"stripping the flag\" (holding the flag silk with your fingers so you won't reveal the color(s) of the flag.) Flag poles and silks both come in different sizes, and there are different shapes and textures for silks, as well. Flags frequently have weights -generally 1 in. carriage bolts or the like- in the bottom and top of the pole to make it easier to toss the flag into the air. However, even with the weights, weather conditions such as wind and rain can affect a flag's spin and disrupt a toss if not correctly taken into account.\n\nOriginally, a military color guard often traveled with a band, who would play patriotic songs. This use continued into the civilian marching bands, and today a marching band's color guard are usually found carrying equipment descending from those of military color guard: flags, banners, mock wooden or plastic rifles, and plastic or metal sabres. Modern guards do use real sabres as well, but without the sharpened point.\n\nOne tradition that contributed to color guards in American marching bands is the Swiss art of flag swinging, or Fahnenschwingen. The 1936 Olympian Franz Hug of Lucern, Switzerland came to America and introduced flag swinging in 1937. Leonard Haug, an assistant band director at the University of Wisconsin, was intrigued. Haug created ten flags representing the schools of the Big Ten Conference. When Haug came to the University of Oklahoma the following year, he became the first to introduce the technique in the Southwest and formed a corps of Big Six Conference flag swingers for the Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band. The 1938 squad was all male, but the group was co-ed within two years. By 1940, O.U. flag swingers were participating at basketball games and creating innovative routines with two flags. The OU color guard may be the oldest existing unit of its kind in American marching bands. As Director of the OU band, Haug wrote a training guide for flag swinging and an article for a swing flag brochure, assisting the spread of the trend to other marching bands.\n\nIn 1965, Haug succeeded in combining the swing flag with a baton. It was an idea on which he had worked for years. He called his invention the \"twirl-flag\" baton. He wrote that it was \"a truly American flag baton idea suitable for solo and corps exhibition.\" It was a 32\" baton with a colored flag at each end that rotated around the shaft to prevent fouling. The invention was first featured by the University of Arkansas marching band at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1966, and later manufactured by Kraskin Batons of Minneapolis. For all of Haug's efforts, however, the \"twirl-flag\" baton never caught on, but regular flags and batons remained standard for most marching bands.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, much of the impetus for the evolution of the modern color guard came from the arena of competitive drum and bugle corps. Pioneers from these corps traveled to other areas of the country to teach, introducing color guards to more traditional bands. In 1962, Vincent R. DiNino, Director of the Longhorn Band, \"The Showband of the Southwest\", at the University of Texas began the use big 4'x6' flags in the school colors (orange and white) as a group marching with the band at halftime shows at football games. Since flags of that type were not then available from any commercial vendors, his wife, Jane DiNino, sewed the flags. The flag poles were made of lightweight dowel wood purchased at a local lumber yard with flag holders purchased from a local army-navy surplus store. Movies of the Longhorn Band taken by the Athletic Department at the University of Texas captured the first use of big flags by a college marching band. Director DiNino charged a band member, Larry Cullison, with the duty of charting movements of the flags and working the flags into the performance of the band during halftime performances. By 1972, there were 16 big flags in use as a part of the Longhorn Marching Band at the University of Texas. The use of big flags spread throughout the Southwest Conference. The band directors at the University of Memphis (Memphis State), Dr. Tom Ferguson and Art Theil, recruited music major Sam Shaw to start one of the first collegiate color guards in the South, the \"Bengal Lancers\" in 1974. Director of Bands at Northwestern University, John Paynter, was also one of the first to add a color guard to the marching band when he hired Bugle Corp specialist George Parks in 1976. Consequently, color guards spread quickly throughout the country. The visual effect of spinning and shaking flags drew the attention of crowds and quickly caught on. Having visual impact for pieces played when the band stood still added a whole new dimension to the performance. By the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s color guards had been added to most Southwest Conference, Big Ten and Big 8 (Currently Big 12) bands. Once these prominent university bands had color guards, there was widespread inclusion of guards at high schools across the nation in the 1980s and 1990s. The popularity of color guard has grown such that winter guard has gained widespread membership and attention.\n\nColor guard was not always accepted among marching band organizations. As Arthur Williams stated in his 1958 book, \"The College and University Band\", \"If it actually made no difference to your high school or community whether or not you fronted your band with girl majorettes, baton twirlers, flag swingers, pompom girls, and so on, what would you prefer? Favor use of girl majorettes and so on: 52 percent. Prefer no use of girl majorettes and so on: 48 percent.\" The University of Wisconsin, where Leonard Haug first introduced conference flags, has since discontinued the practice of having a color guard.\n\nWinter guard is similar to outdoor color guard (marched with a drum corps or marching band), except the performances are indoors on gymnasium floors through the winter season. The traditional marching band music heard during fall season is replaced with a recording of various musical genres. A common theme in many shows is loss or something that converys great emotion. The gymnasium floor typically is covered by an individually designed tarp (called a floor mat or floor by members) that generally reflects the show being performed on it. Occasionally the floor only acts as a backdrop so that the audience is drawn towards what the members are doing. The members may perform barefoot, but wearing jazz shoes or modern dance shoes is also common. There are several winter guard circuits for participating in competitions during indoor season, including TIA (Tournament Indoor Association), MAIN (Mid-Atlantic Indoor Network), AIA (Atlantic Indoor Association), WGI (Winter Guard International), and many more.\n\nWinter Guard International (WGI) is the \"Sport of the Arts\", in which teams of highly skilled individuals work to create and perform complex sequences of dance, music, and use of special equipment, such as sabres, rifles, and flags, to compete by division. This organization refers to winter guard as the \"Sport of the Arts\" due to the equally athletic and artistic nature of the activity. Co-founded in 1977 by six people, the goal of WGI was to organize and standardize the activity by creating skill levels, scoring systems, venues, and competitions.\n\nToday, groups participating in a WGI event are placed into one of eight categories; Middle School, Regional A, Scholastic A, Independent A, Scholastic Open, Independent Open, Scholastic World, or Independent World. WGI hosts many regional competitions which lead up to the World Championships, a three-day event in which hundreds of winter guard groups come together to compete. WGI Championships is held in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe judging community is a body of professionals who are working to perpetuate the unique experience WGI Sport of the Arts offers. Many are professionally trained in music, dance and theatre and use that knowledge to enhance the performances through one on one critique meetings after performances. Judges applying for WGI approval must complete a home study process, the Judges' Academy, trialing on guards in every class mentioned above, and participate in a continuing education program that encompasses annual study requirements and clinics. WGI judges are knowledgeable of what is expected from each of the above-mentioned classes.\n\n\n10. www.phirhopsinational.com \n\n"}

Such affective disposition can also explain the persistence of ethnic jokes in multicultural societies.

{"id": "48748780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48748780", "title": "Deictic field and narration", "text": "Deictic field and narration\n\nIn linguistics, psychology, and literary theory, the concepts of deictic field and deictic shift are sometimes deployed in the study of narrative media. These terms provide a theoretical framework for helping literary analysts to conceptualize the ways in which readers redirect their attention away from their immediate surroundings as they become immersed in the reality generated by the text.\n\nThe term \"deixis\" refers to the ways in which language encodes contextual information into its grammatical system. More broadly, deixis refers to the inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs. To understand deixis, one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the \"here\" and \"now\" (proximal deixis) from the \"then\" and \"there\" (distal deixis). According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of deixis, \"When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on extralinguistic, subjective, occasion-specific considerations.\" Within the context of narrative, deixis reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story's characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. \"Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation\". Deixis is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative.\n\nWhen examining perspectives on narration in natural-language environments, one must not ignore William Labov, who argues that stories of personal experience can be divided into distinct sections, each of which serves a unique function within the narrative progression. Labov schematizes the organization of natural narrative using the following conceptual units: abstract, orientation, complicating action, resolution, evaluation, and coda. Generally, anecdotal narratives tend to arrange these units in the order outlined; however, this is not an inflexible, structural progression that defines how every narrative must develop. For instance, sentences and phrasal items that serve an evaluative function can be interspersed throughout a narrative. Some stretches of narrative discourse also feature overlap among these Labovian categories. Each of Labov's narrative divisions serves a characteristic purpose typified by a particular section's grammatical construction and functional role within the unfolding narrative, but the boundaries of such divisions are not always clear-cut.\n\nAs a feature of natural language, deixis is an important element of oral narrative and can be realized in different ways in each of Labov's categories. According to Galbraith, \"All language use depends on some felt relevance to situation, on the attention of participants, and their ability to lift out the topic...Like zero in mathematics and the dark space in the theater, deixis orients us within a situation without calling attention to itself\". Two of Labov's categories that often feature deixis prominently are the \"orientation\" and the \"coda\". The orientation typically occurs near the beginning of a narrative and serves to introduce the characters, settings, and events. Given its presentative quality, the orientation shifts the deictic center away from the speaker's here-and-now into the spatiotemporal coordinates of the story, which logically must occur at a time prior to the story's enunciation. The coda occurs toward the end of a narrative and functions as a means of terminating the flow of story events. By doing so, the coda reorients the speakers and listeners out of the story world and back into the communicative present.\n\nThe deictic center—sometimes called the \"origo\" or zero-point—represents the originating source in relation to which deictic expressions gain their context-dependent meaning. Often the deictic center is the speaker: thus, any tokens of \"I\" in the speaker's discourse must deictically refer back to the speaker as center; likewise, the word \"you\" must project outward from this center toward the addressee. Any participants not part of this communicative channel will be referred to in the third person. The theory of deixis is therefore egocentric in that the indexical anchorage of deictic expressions is a function of this zero-point of subjectivity. The \"I\"-center serves as the perceptual vantage point that surveys relations among salient contextual entities and events. Such a center, therefore, determines which deictic expressions are pragmatically licensed by a context that has been naturally delimited through this perceptual and evaluative locus. Thus, the appropriateness of a proximal \"this\" over a distal \"that\" is determined by the nearness of an object or a location in relation to the deictic zero-point.\n\nA deictic field contains the range of bounded participants and objects, spatial locations and landmarks, and temporal frames that point back to some deictic center as the source for their pragmatic demarcation. The deictic field radiates out from the deictic center, and the boundaries of such a field enclose the scope of objects, spaces, and events that constitute a set from which deictic expressions might seek out a potential referent. These fields function as cognitive frames that participants in a discourse can use to conceptualize their contextual surroundings in relation to each interlocutor's (alternating) function as deictic center across communicative turns. Within the context of literature, the presence of multiple deictic fields in a text can be fruitfully analyzed using the cognitive principle of deictic shift (discussed below).\n\nDeictic shift theory (DST) refers to a range of immersion processes by which readers imaginatively project hypothetical deictic centers that are anchored to communicative and experiential loci within a narrative. Such cognitive framing, theorists of DST argue, form a necessary part of the reader's involvement in narrative, whereby through a process of frame shifting the reader constructs a story world by interpreting the (deictic) cues instantiated in the text. Deictic shifting can be accomplished in several ways. The most basic shift involves the reader's initial immersion into the world of the story. Here the deictic center moves out of the here-and-now of the reader's physical environment and becomes anchored to some text-internal perceptual or presentative instance, in most cases the deictic center of a character or a narrator. Deictic shifts at the level of narration include those cues that implicate a covert or overt narrator—specifically, story commentary or instances when the narrator refers to himself or herself as an \"I.\" Such instances of commentary and evaluation often reflect the perceptual field, as well as the interpretive and ideological stance, of the narrator as he or she presents the story's events.\n\nWithin the world of the story, deictic shifts occur in a number of ways. A fundamental shift occurs when the deictic center moves from one character to another—for instance, in cases of omniscient thought report. Here the reader must adjust the deictic center accordingly and interprets the lens of the current focal window through the experiential subjectivity of the character-locus. Other forms of story-internal deictic shifts involve the cognitive framing associated with embedded narratives and other discourse-types: stories-within-stories, letters in epistolary fiction, diary entries, hypertext ruptures, etc.\n\"Within literary scholarship, it is often noted that first and second person pronouns (and less so, and differently, third) facilitate readerly identification with the textually inscribed position (the position of the character or narrator designated by that pronoun), and evoke a sense of readerly conceptual immersion in the fictional world of the story, contributing to the ways in which the scene is imaginatively 'realized' in the mind of the reader, particularly the perspective from which the scene is conceptually visualized. Cognitive poetics and cognitive narratology have employed deictic shift theory, largely based on the work of Duchan, Bruder and Hewitt, to attempt to offer a cognitive account of how these interpretative effects are created. DST proposes that readers conceptually project to the contextual locus of the speaker of deictic cues in order to comprehend them, offering a model of how the deictic referents determining such contextual coordinates are processed by readers, and how this contributes to readers' conceptualization of the world of the story\" (Deictic shifting in literature: Experimental analysis).\n\nBuhler applied the theory of deixis to narratives. He proposed the concept of Zeigfeld, or deictic field, which operates in three modes: the first, \"ad oculos\", \"operates in the here-and-now of the speaker's sensible environment;\" the second, anaphora, \"operates in the context of the discourse itself considered as a structured environment;\" and the third, what Buhler calls \"deixis at phantasma\", operates in the context \"of imagination and long-term memory.\" Buhler's model attempts \"to describe the psychological and physical process whereby the live deictic field of our own bodily orientation and experience\" is \"transposed into an imaginative construction.\" According to Buhler, \"the body-feeling representation, or Korspertastbild (what psychologists would probably now call the body schema), becomes loosened from its involvement with the HERE//NOW/I deictic coordinates of waking life in our immediate environment, and becomes available to translation into an environment we construct both conceptually and orientationally\"; this deictic coordinate system is used \"in the constructive environment to orient ourselves within 'the somewhere-realm of pure imagination and the there-and-there in memory'\".\n\nKatie Hamburger, a German narrative theorist, studied and theorized how deictic words are used in literature. In her work \"The Logic of Literature\", she argued that there are two realms of language act: reality statement and fiction (Galbraith, 24-25). Reality statements are by someone and about something. \"Acts of fictional narration, on the other hand, transfer their referentiality from the actuality of the historical world to the entertained reality of the fictive world, and transfer the subjectivity of the speaker to the subjectivity of the story world characters\". Hamburger argued that this transfer occurs due to the use of deictic adverbs, and psychological verbs.\n"}
{"id": "4861797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4861797", "title": "Dramatistic pentad", "text": "Dramatistic pentad\n\nThe dramatistic pentad forms the core structure of dramatism, a method for examining motivations that the renowned literary critic Kenneth Burke developed. Dramatism recommends the use of a metalinguistic approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five rhetorical elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the \"dramatistic pentad.\" Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its characters. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their world view.\n\nBurke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book \"A Grammar of Motives\". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines \"questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when\". Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, \"The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula\".\n\nThe pentad also closely follows the journalistic 'Five Ws': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states \"Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information.\" \n\nThe dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them,\" to read them \"at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other,\" and \"in a wider context than any of them recognizes.\"\n\nAct, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question \"what?\", is related to the world view of realism; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”\n\nScene, which is associated with the setting of an act and answers the questions \"when?\" and \"where?\", is related to the world view of materialism and minimal or non-existent free will. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” \n\nAgent, which answers the question \"by whom?\", reflects the world view of philosophical idealism. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” \n\nAgency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question \"how?\", implies a pragmatic point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”\n\nPurpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question \"why?\", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.\n\nIn A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.\n\nThis is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’\" The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. \nLikewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”\n\nThe rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio).\"\n\nThe scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.” This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.\n\nA relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.\n\nWhile requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.” This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.\n\nIn A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,” remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency. Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element. In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad. Attitude is defined as \"the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act.\" The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”. There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad. While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.” Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.” As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.\n"}

Most often it includes content intended to teach but has incidental entertainment value. It has been used by academia, corporations, governments, and other entities in various countries to disseminate information in classrooms and/or via television, radio, and other media to influence viewers' opinions and behaviors.\n\nInterest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the Renaissance and Enlightenment being movements in which this combination was presented to students. Komenský in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes pedagogy with dramatic or delightful elements.\n\n\"Poor Richard’s Almanack\" demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with Benjamin Franklin combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.\n\nLater development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to Walt Disney, with his first educational short film, \"Tommy Tucker’s Tooth\", being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute. The entry of the U.S. into World War II also had a major impact on the popularity of educational entertainment, as a relationship between Disney and the U.S. government formed; Disney was able to experiment with educational and nonfiction films in a way that continued even after the war, with series such as \"True-Life Adventures\" and \"Disneyland\". In the transcript of an interview with Alexander P. de Seversky from The Walt Disney Archives, of which its date and interviewer is unknown, the following quotation is found:Since the 1970s, various groups in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Latin America have used edutainment to address health and social issues such as substance abuse, immunization, teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and cancer. Initiatives in major universities, such as Johns Hopkins University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, NGOs such as PCI-Media Impact, and government agencies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have produced edutainment content.\n\nModern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.\n\nThe term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by Walt Disney to describe the \"True Life Adventures\" series. The noun \"edutainment\" is a neologistic portmanteau used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the National Geographic Society. It was also used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project. The offshoot word \"Edutainer\" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.\n\n\"Schoolhouse Rock\", \"Wishbone\", \"Sesame Street\", and \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" are examples of shows that use music and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as YouTube, with such channels as \"Vsauce\", \"CGP Grey\", \"MinutePhysics\", \"Meet Arnold, \"Veritasium\", and \"Crash Course\".\n\nPublic Service Broadcasting is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the British Film Institute into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album \"Inform—Educate—Entertain\", which covers topics such as the climbing of Mount Everest and highway safety, demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.\n\nMotion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as \"Private Snafu\", and can still be seen in films such as \"An Inconvenient Truth\". After World War II, educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.\n\nMexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via telenovelas, \"soap operas for social change\". The \"Sabido method\" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China. In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.\n\nThe third season of the television show \"MTV Shuga\" was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about sexual health and HIV, and secondarily, gender-based violence. In the randomized control trials, those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show’s effects on gender-based violence.\n\nAccording to the article Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series. This series was one that satisfied Walt Disney the most as it obtained both the qualities of entertainment and education, which was the characteristics of this series.\n\nEducating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia, Millefeuille about psoriasis and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.\n\nGames fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including board, card, and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.\n\nAccording to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.\n\nAccording to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants \"multiple streams of information\" (p. 1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of \"fun\". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.\n\nKim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with meta-cognitive strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.\n\nRadio can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera \"The Archers\" has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the Tanzanian radio soap opera \"Twende na Wakati\" (\"Let's Go With the Times\") was written primarily to promote family planning.\n\nLikewise, podcasts have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also podcasts used as an educational tool. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with \"TeachersPayTeachers\" finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of \"Serial\".\n\nOther successful radio programs and/or podcasts that have fused entertainment and education include:\n\nToys are perhaps the earliest \"edutainment\" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their aesthetic appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature piano) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.\n\nToys are often employed in the context of mimicry and roleplay to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to simulation in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an instinct or a character trait in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to \"express\" those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express motherhood as much as to explore it.\n\nEven for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static figurine, for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a Native American may be a starting point for exploring American history; a Santa Claus may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy astronaut to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly \"edutaining\" object, such as a picture book. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.\n\nEven \"grown-ups\" can learn through toys about children: what are their talents or interests; if they are more extrovert or introvert; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.\n\nSome toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as Lego or Rubik's Cube, as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.\n\nThe term \"edutainment\" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by KRS-One (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his Boogie Down Productions album by the same name.\n\nThe term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see Paulo Freire's use of praxis in \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\") and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing. Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through \"building\" or \"building sessions.\"\n\nThe concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational. As an example, PowerPoint presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, \"The Onion\", poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects. A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying \"When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something.\"\n\nTheme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. Epcot at Walt Disney World, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company, is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by Marty Sklar and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May EPCOT Center entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere.\"\n\nThe offerings and promotions at SeaWorld associated with the educational topics of marine biology, conservation, and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming Abu Dhabi theme park, which is likely due to activism for animal rights.\n\nOther notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are Disney's Animal Kingdom, Holy Land Experience, Dinosaur World, Busch Gardens, and Puy du Fou.\n\nEdutainment is also a growing paradigm within the science center and children's museum community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the zoo or a botanical garden. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, field trip visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and mobile apps, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing. Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted. Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.\nMuch research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of flipped classrooms, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned video lessons and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.\n\nIn a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), \"Numb3rs\", which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of preservice mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote critical thinking, increased engagement, and growth mindsets.\n\nSimilarly, Craig D. Cox, \"et al\". (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy preceptors; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.\n\nA system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with disabled students by Amal Dandashi, \"et al\". (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.\n\nAs for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other \"reading encounters.\"\n\nDebate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades. The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his \"True-Life Adventures\" series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which \"The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background\" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of \"White Wilderness\" prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.\n\n\"Sesame Street\", a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in \"The Atlantic\" in May 1971, John Holt criticizes the promotion of \"Right Answers\" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.\n\nThe argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled \"Amusing Ourselves to Death\" by theorist Neil Postman demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.” Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on \"the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment.\"\n"}
{"id": "65974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65974", "title": "First-person narrative", "text": "First-person narrative\n\nA first-person narrative is a mode of storytelling in which a narrator relays events from their own point of view using the first person It may be narrated by a first person protagonist (or other focal character), first person re-teller, first person witness, or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator). A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" (1847), in which the title character is also the narrator telling her own story, \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\".\n\nThis device allows the audience to see the narrator's mind's eye view of the fictional universe, but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view. Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An unreliable narrator is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.\n\nThe telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of \"I.\" An example would be Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", which begins \"Call me Ishmael.\"\n\nFirst-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale. First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.\n\nA story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.\n\nFirst-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge. As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.\n\nCharacter weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written. Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. Unreliable narrators are not uncommon.\n\nIn the first-person-plural point of view, narrators tell the story using \"we\". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:\n\n\nOther examples include \"Twenty-Six Men and a Girl\" by Maxim Gorky, \"The Treatment of Bibi Haldar\" by Jhumpa Lahiri, \"During the Reign of the Queen of Persia\" by Joan Chase, \"Our Kind\" by Kate Walbert, \"I, Robot\" by Isaac Asimov, and \"We Didn't\" by Stuart Dybek. \n\nFirst-person narrators can also be multiple, as in Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's \"In a Grove\" (the source for the movie \"Rashomon\") and Faulkner's novel \"The Sound and the Fury\". Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.\n\nThere can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in Robert A. Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\". The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their \"own\" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak \"live\" about the same event.\n\nThe first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\" or F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\", each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as \"first person major\" or \"first person minor\" points of view.\n\nThe narrator can be the protagonist (e.g., Gulliver in \"Gulliver's Travels\"), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions (Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in \"The Great Gatsby\"). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called \"frame narrators\": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in \"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily Brontë; and the unnamed narrator in \"Heart of Darkness\" by Joseph Conrad. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.\n\nA rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak, where the narrator is Death, and \"The Lovely Bones\" by Alice Sebold, where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, extracorporeal viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.\n\nIn autobiographical fiction, the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include Jim Carroll in \"The Basketball Diaries\" and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. in \"Timequake\" (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—\"the book in your hands\"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco, and \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" by Mark Haddon. Another example is a fictional \"Autobiography of James T. Kirk\" which was \"Edited\" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek) as he wrote the novel.\n\nSince the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for detective fiction, so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the \"Watson\", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of Dr Watson in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nFirst-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\"; dramatic monologue, also in Albert Camus' \"The Fall\"; or explicitly, as Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\nOther forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.\n\nWith a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.\n\nFirst-person narratives can tend towards a stream of consciousness and Interior monologue, as in Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\". The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a false document, such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a frame story presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".\n\nFirst-person narrators are often unreliable narrators since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\"), lie (as in \"The Quiet American\" by Graham Greene, or \"The Book of the New Sun\" series by Gene Wolfe), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in \"The Remains of the Day\" by Kazuo Ishiguro, or in Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"). Henry James discusses his concerns about \"the romantic privilege of the 'first person'\" in his preface to \"The Ambassadors\", calling it \"the darkest abyss of romance.\"\n\nOne example of a multi-level narrative structure is Joseph Conrad's novella \"Heart of Darkness\", which has a double framework: an unidentified \"I\" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an \"I\" narrator introducing a storyteller as \"he\" (Marlow), who talks about himself as \"I\" and introduces another storyteller as \"he\" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of \"I\".\n\nFirst person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.\n"}

{"id": "2247943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247943", "title": "Home theater in a box", "text": "Home theater in a box\n\nA \"home theater in a box\" (HTIB) is an integrated home theater package which \"bundles\" together a combination DVD or Blu-ray player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a surround sound decoder, a radio tuner, and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a remote control, a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as \"2.1\") and a low-frequency subwoofer cabinet.\nIn 2016,\nthey are manufactured by most makers of consumer electronics. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price \"house\" brands (e.g., Best Buy's \"Insignia\" line) may be a \"2.1\" system. Many, however, are a full \"5.1\" system and some higher-end packages even have a 7.1 system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are RCA, Philips, Panasonic, Sony, Yamaha, LG and Samsung, all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. Bose and Onkyo make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.\n\nHTIBs are marketed as an \"all-in-one\" way for consumers to enjoy the surround sound experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics \"know-how\" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible impedance and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include HDMI cables, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.\n\nOn the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and \"tweakability\" of home theater components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive equalization options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a crossover control, a phase inversion switch, and a parametric equalizer, a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too \"boomy\" in a room.\n\nA typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel power amplifier and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a subwoofer. Some HTIB systems also have a radio tuner or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. Spotify). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a television set or monitor with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with HDMI with ARC, optical and SPDIF inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.\n\nThere are systems in this class that are sold without a DVD player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the \"receiver-only\" packages that do not come with a DVD player.\n\nSome HTIBs use proprietary connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation. However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by manufacturers to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.\n\nA few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the surround speakers in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.\n\nSome older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a hard disk for recording TV shows.\n"}

Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the Renaissance period, including those of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187161", "title": "Intellectual rights to magic methods", "text": "Intellectual rights to magic methods\n\nIntellectual rights to magic methods refers to the legal and ethical debate about the extent to which proprietary or exclusive rights may subsist in the methods or processes by which magic tricks or illusions are performed. It is a subject of some controversy. \n\nOn one side, many magicians argue that methods represent \"intellectual property\" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as \"exposure\" and many magicians react angrily to it. \n\nWhile many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all \"exposure\", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works – works with living and identifiable creators.\n\nThere are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. Copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. \n\nUnder the Berne Convention, member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is \"fixed\", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., copyright law only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves.\n\nThe idea–expression dichotomy specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.\n\nAnother potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose & Her Shadow.\n\nMagic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act against America Online to remove a video from their website.\n\nAn invention or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially patentable in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works.\n\nNotably, in 1938, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was sued by magician Horace Goldin over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a \"Sawing a woman in half\" trick. The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods.\n\nExamples of patented inventions for conjuring include:\n\nMagic methods are effectively forms of trade secret and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of \"confidentiality\" and \"contract law\" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information – i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright.\n\nA company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates. A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a non-disclosure agreement before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. \n\nInformation which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the public domain may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of confidentiality. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available.\n\nCourt cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of case law. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include:\n\n\nThe most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of ethics or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the International Brotherhood of Magicians, has a Code of Ethics which states:\n\nThe Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that \"exposing\" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians.\n\nHowever, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.\n\n"}

Exposure to postmodern nonlinear narratives, performative and mediated audiovisual arts, predisposes the individual to originate layers of symbolic meaning that overlap with socially codified environments.\nThe involuntary narrative has neither been constructed by an author of media content, nor read as such by a reader/spectator.\n\nIllusion and displacement are some of the effects resulting in an individual, when connections are drawn between a trigger in one sensory channel and a result in another, virtual and physical states and conditions of one and the same object, media or technology are perceived as a continuum. \nWhen a purposeful overlap of the physical and the virtual takes place, it could be called vireal (Gramelsberger, Klein).\n\nThe involuntary narrative, hypnagogia and the Dreamachine, trigger what is already in the individual by referring to his or her own past history. The involuntary narrative is accidental and in that differs from both the hypnagogic state and the state induced by the Dreamachine.\n\nAuditive and visual signals, as for example mobile phone ringtones, virtual identity thumbnails, alert sounds, signals and information screens in public transport, adverts displayed in LED screens, constitute stimuli to trigger the occurrence of an involuntary narrative.\nAnamnesis, as used by Pascal Broccolichi in his work \"Lexicon:\" ”when a sound, or a sound context, recalls a situation or an environment that has been taken out of its chronology”.\n\nAs the density of visible and audible mass communication in the urban environment increased in the 20th century, historical predecessors of involuntary narratives emerged. The attempt to create parallel levels of meaning in the perception of the physically real is an objective these predecessors have in common.\nApplying the cut-up technique, invented in the 1960s by Bryon Gysin, to text, William Burroughs achieved results of new narratives (whose order/sequence had not been put together willingly) which would often yield surprising results, even giving account of future events that were later verified. \nThe dérive (English: drift) developed in the 1950s by the Situationists is a technique to explore and navigate urban space without preformalized trajectories.\nMisreadings of common everyday objects, as used in Surrealism and Dada, some of no symbolic content, some of highly symbolic content produce results similar to the ones described here, but are always authored.\n\n- Cut-up technique\n\n- Dérive\n\n- Involuntary memory\n\n- Serendipity\n"}
{"id": "25161168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25161168", "title": "J-Setting", "text": "J-Setting\n\nJ-Setting is a style of dance popularized by the Prancing J-Settes, a popular collegiate female dance team of the Jackson State University's Sonic Boom of the South marching band. It originated in the late 1970s from African-Americans in the Jackson, Mississippi, area of the United States.\n\nThis dance style is characterized by a lead and follow format where one dancer initiates a series of high-energy dance moves, and the other dancers join in the movement. J-Setting features specific dance steps based on Prancing J-Settes marching techniques including the \"J-Sette Walk,\" the \"Salt and Pepper,\" the \"Strut,\" and the \"Tip Toe\". In particular, the \"Salt and Pepper\" is a type of prance step for which the Prancing J-Settes are named and known. It is a high-knee lift or \"high step\" style of marching. Alternating legs lift with a bent knee to bring the foot up to the height of the opposite knee before returning the foot to the ground.\n\nThe JSU Prancing J-Settes typically march and perform in rows organized by height. J-Setting dancers also typically perform in a line or in multiple lines. While performing, dancers may also change dance formation similar to the way that marching bands change formation during shows on football fields.\n\nThe J-Setting style of dress is modeled after the dance uniforms of the JSU Prancing J-Settes. It normally includes a one or two piece bodysuit or form-fitting garment that covers the torso and crotch; and hosiery with knee high boots on the legs. However, other types of garments are also worn during a performance.\n\nIn 1970, Shirley Middleton and the other majorettes of the Jackson State University Marching Band met with then JSU president, Dr. John A. Peoples, to request that they be permitted to \"put down their batons.\" The JSU President agreed; and as the majorette sponsor, Middleton assembled 18 female students to become the first Jaycettes (currently called J-Settes). Middleton, a formally trained ballet dancer, established technical performance standards for the J-Settes, as well as, standards for academic and personal behavior for its members when they were not performing. Dr. Jimmie James, Jr., then Chair of the JSU Department of Music, described the new dance team as \"the thrill of a thousand eyes.\" During Middleton's tenure, performances included dance routines to songs such as \"James Brown's \"Make it Funky,\" and \"Hot Pants\" as performed by the JSU Marching Band.\n\nPrior to 1975, Hollis Pippins, a former baton twirler for the JSU marching band, sometimes assisted J-Settes director Shirley Middleton, with choreography. In addition to performing with the JSU marching band, he performed on \"Soul Train\" and \"Putting on the Hits\" national television shows; and on \"Black Gold\", a local TV show. In 1975, Narah Oatis was appointed the sponsor of the Prancing J-Settes. Under her leadership, the \"J-Sette Walk\" and other signature marching steps were developed, and performances included an appearance on the \"30th Anniversary of Motown\" television show in 1990.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, African American gay men who were fans of The Prancing J-Settes regularly attended the dance team's practice sessions, and performances at college football games and other events. Young gay men brought the J-Settes dance style back to their home towns, and to gay nightclubs like Club City Lights in Jackson, Mississippi; Club Skittles Baton Rouge; Incognito, Allusions, and 901 in Memphis; and Club 708 in Atlanta.\n\nAlthough the Prancing J-Settes is a female dance team, in 1997 male JSU baton twirler DeMorris Adams performed with the J-Settes in place of an injured female member. However, the Prancing J-Settes have not confirmed this and, in fact, some have stated that it is not true. There is also no footage to substantiate this claim.\n\nBy the mid 2000s, J-Setting became popular in clubs such as: Club Candy'z, Splash Baton Rouge; Club Metro Jackson; Woodward, Tom Philips Post Detroit; Club 2020 Houston; Club Rush/ Chap Atlanta; Club Crystal's Lake Charles; Central Station Shreveport; and The Brick Dallas. Also several black gay pride events host organized J-Sette battles.\n\nIn 1990, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes style of marching and dancing on the \"30th Anniversary of Motown\" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances to \"I Heard it through the Grapevine\"and other songs. A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.\n\nIn 2003, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes marching and dancing style on the \"34th NAACP Image Awards\" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances with comedian \"Cedric the Entertainer\" and \"Sugar Bear of E.U.\" A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.\n\nIn 2008, both Beyoncé's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Diva\" music videos included a J-Setting style dance routine. Choreographer Frank Gatson is credited with introducing the J-Setting dance style to Beyoncé.\n\nJ-Setting troupes compete in dance-offs at gay cultural events. These groups of young gay men and women imitate the JSU Prancing J-Settes marching and dance style and dress. \nThese dance groups perform in costumes that are similar in appearance to the JSU J-Settes uniforms; including sequined one- and two-piece leotards, with long flowing capes, sheer stockings and white marching boots. Some of the popular J-Setting teams include: Jackson's Male Prancing J-Settes (MPJ); Memphis Elite; Atlanta's J-Phi; Texas Southern Heat; Texas Teasers of Dallas; D.M.B. of Atlanta; Atlanta Toxic; Jus Blaze; Dallas Diamonds; Baton Rouge Xtreme; Detroit Danz Zone; Nashville's Music City All-Starz; Capitol City Dolls International; Prancing Elites; Shreveport Pussy Cat Dolls; and Grambling, La.'s X-Men.\n\nThe competitions seen in Lifetime's Bring It! were inspired by J-Setting competitions.\n\nBeginning April 22, 2015, the Oxygen channel began broadcasting a 12-episode documentary series entitled \"The Prancing Elites Project\", focusing on the J-Setting group from Mobile, Alabama. The Prancing Elites had begun to attract national attention after a complimentary Tweet from Shaquille O'Neal in June 2013, which led to an appearance on the syndicated talk show \"The Real\".\n\nIn 2018, a released documentary entitled \"When The Beat Drops\", chronicled the progression of J-Setting and its impact on black gay culture (primarily in Atlanta).\n\n\n"}

It began with Shōnen Jump manga magazine in 1968, later renamed \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\". The origin of the name is unknown. The \"Jump\" magazines are intended for the male audience, although the \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazine has also been popular to the female demographic. Along with the line of manga magazines, \"Jump\" also includes a crossover media franchise, where there have been various \"Jump\" themed crossover anime and (since \"Famicom Jump\") which bring together various \"Shōnen Jump\" manga characters.\n\nIn 1949, Shueisha got into the business of making manga magazines, the first being \"Omoshiro Book\". In 1951, Shueisha created a female version of that anthology entitled \"Shōjo Book\". \"Shōjo Book\" led to the publication of the highly successful Shōjo manga magazine: \"Ribon\". \"Omoshiro Book\" went out of print and Shueisha decided to make another male version of their successful \"Shōjo Book\" to even it out and made the magazine \"Shōnen Book\". In the middle of \"Shōnen Book's\" publication, \"Shōnen Jump\" began its run (at the time was a Semiweekly magazine and had no \"Weekly\"). \"Shōnen Book\" ended when \"Shōnen Jump\" became a Weekly magazine correctly changing its name to \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\". In 1969 a special issue called \"Bessatsu Shōnen Jump\" took \"Shōnen Book's\" place. In addition to the success of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\", Shueisha created a Seinen version of the magazine in 1979, called \"Young Jump\" (now \"Weekly Young Jump\"). \"Bessatsu Shōnen Jump\", later got renamed \"Monthly Shōnen Jump\" and became a magazine of its own. The seasonal issues of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" are now called \"Akamaru Jump\". In 1985, Shueisha started the publication of two business related manga magazines; a salaryman \"Jump\" magazine called \"Business Jump\" and an office lady manga magazine called \"Office You\", also in 1988 started the publication of \"Super Jump\". Many other Seinen related \"Jump\" magazines, started as spin-off issues of the \"Weekly Young Jump\" magazine. In 1993, Shueisha announced and released the video game/manga magazine \"V Jump\" alongside the Jump light novel line \"Jump j-Books\". In 2003 Shogakukan's Viz Media released an English version of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" called \"Shonen Jump\". \"Monthly Shōnen Jump\" discontinued in 2007 and was replaced with the \"Jump SQ.\" magazine, four series from the magazine were moved. In addition to the \"Jump SQ.\" anthology, a spin-off issue was created, called \"Jump SQ.II (Second)\". \"Saikyō Jump\" was started on December 3, 2010, with close ties to \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" and \"V Jump\".\n\n\n\n is used as an imprint label for publishing manga, most often for collected tankōbon volumes of manga series originally serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" and other \"Jump\" magazines.\n\nSome of the most popular manga serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" include:\n\n\n is Jump convention held every year. \"Jump Festa\" focuses on all the Shōnen related magazines: \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\", \"V Jump\", \"Jump SQ.\", \"Saikyō Jump\", and formerly featured \"Monthly Shōnen Jump\" at the conventions.

It is derived from the name Jacques de la Palice, and the word is used in several languages.\n\nLa Palice's epitaph reads\nThese words were misread (accidentally or intentionally) as \"...il ſerait [serait] encore en vie\" (\"...he would still be alive\"), where the long s aids in the confusion. In the 16th century this misreading was incorporated into a popular satirical song, and in time many other variants developed, including \"... que deux jours avant sa mort / il était encore en vie\" (\"... that two days before his death / he was still quite alive\") and \"... et quand il était tout nu, / il n'avait point de chemise\"\n(\"... and when he was stark naked / he didn't wear a shirt\").\n\nIn the early 18th century Bernard de la Monnoye collected over 50 of these humorous \"La Palice\" quatrains, and published them as a burlesque Song of La Palice. From that song came the French term \"lapalissade\" meaning an utterly obvious truth—i.e. a truism or tautology, and it was borrowed into several other languages. Since that day, when you say something very obvious, your interlocutor answers : \"La Palice would have said as much !\" (in French : \"La Palice en aurait dit autant !\").\n\nIn Spanish culture, an analog is a folkloric character (Perogrullo) with his \"perogrulladas\": \"Verdad de Pedro Grullo, que a la mano cerrada, la llama puño\" (The truth of Pedro Grullo, when his hand is closed, he calls it a fist).\n\nIn English, one might reference \"Captain Obvious\" as having spoken a self-evident truth.

Literary agents most often represent novelists, screenwriters, and non-fiction writers. They are paid a fixed percentage (usually twenty percent on foreign sales and ten to fifteen percent for domestic sales) of the proceeds of sales they negotiate on behalf of their clients.\n\nLiterary agents perform various services for authors. They connect the author's work with appropriate publishers, negotiate contracts, ensure royalty payments, and mediating problems between author and publisher. Agents can help new authors get public recognition. Agents also help publishing houses and others expedite the process of review, publication, and distribution of authors' works. Many well-known, powerful, and lucrative publishing houses (such as the Big Five) are generally less open than smaller publishers to unrepresented submissions. A knowledgeable agent knows the market, and can be a source of valuable career advice and guidance. Being a publishable author doesn't automatically make someone an expert on modern publishing contracts and practices—especially where television, film, or foreign rights are involved. Many authors prefer to have an agent handle such matters. This prevents straining the author's working relationship with the editor with disputes about royalty statements or late checks. \n\nAn agent can also function as an adviser, showing an author the various aspects of how to make a living writing. Literary agents often transition from jobs in other aspects of the publishing industry. Though self-publishing is becoming much more popular, literary agents still fulfill a useful role as gatekeepers to publishing houses.\n\nLiterary agencies can range in size from a single agent who represents perhaps a dozen authors, to a substantial firm with senior partners, sub-agents, specialists in areas like foreign rights or licensed merchandise tie-ins, and clients numbering in the hundreds. Most agencies, especially smaller ones, specialize to some degree. They may represent—for example—authors of science fiction, mainstream thrillers and mysteries, children's books, romance, or highly topical nonfiction. Very few agents represent short stories or poetry.\n\nLegitimate agents and agencies in the book world are not required to be members of the Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR), but according to \"Writer's Market\" listings, many agents in the United States are. To qualify for AAR membership, agents must have sold a minimum number of books and pledge to abide by a Canon of Ethics. Effective professional agents often learn their trade while working for another agent, though some cross over to agenting after working as editors.\n\nLegitimate agents do not charge reading or other upfront fees (e.g., retainers), or bill authors for most operating expenses. They also do not offer to place work with a vanity or subsidy press.\n\nA client typically establishes a relationship with an agent through \"querying\", though the two may meet at a writers' conference, through a contest, or in other ways. A query is an unsolicited proposal for representation, either for a finished work or unfinished work. Various agents request different elements in a query packet, and most agencies list their specific submission requirement on their Website or in their listing in major directories. It typically begins with the author sending a query letter (1-2 pages) that explains the purpose of the work and any writing qualifications of the author. Some agencies want a synopsis or outline as part of the query. Often, the author sends the first three chapters (typically around 50 pages) of their work. For paper queries, the author must include a self-addressed stamped envelope to receive a response, though email submissions are increasingly common.\n\nIf an agency rejects a written query, they send the response—typically a form letter—in the self-addressed stamped envelope. A rejection that is not merely a form letter, or has hand-written comments (especially a message to the effect of \"query me for other projects\") is typically a good sign.\n\nThe first literary agents appeared around the year 1880 (Publishing).\n\n\n\n"}

It was written and directed by John Walsh and released in 2000 at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It was re-released in 2014 after the film negative, thought lost, was rediscovered.\n\n\"Monarch\" is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant.\n\nIn an \"Irish Post\" interview, Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”\n\nT. P. McKenna plays Henry VIII, while Jean Marsh plays an amalgamation of his ex-wives. Peter Miles played a courtier to King Henry. James Coombes (known for his James Bond style role in the Cadbury chocolate Milk Tray advertisements popular on UK television) played the King's personal protection guard.\n\nIt was shot on 35mm Kodak 5287 stock using Arriflex cameras. Principal photography commenced in October 1996 at Charlton House in south London, making it the only film about Henry VIII entirely shot in the borough where he was born: Greenwich. This Jacobean building served as the main location, with filming taking place inside and outside the house. The gardens were the backdrop for the opening title sequence. The Grand Salon and the Long Gallery featured heavily for the film’s dramatic scenes with Henry VIII. The house's clock tower was also utilised as the hiding place for Will, the ground-keeper's son, who hid from men who break into the house. Although set at night much of the filming took place during the day; black drapes were hung outside of the building to create a night effect.\n\nIn an interview with newspaper \"The Greenwich Visitor\" (page 5), Walsh discussed how he wanted his depiction of Henry VIII to be more grounded and less like those portrayals from Hollywood. He also discussed the difficulty of filming on a location and how the film benefited from using 35mm Kodak film stock.\n\nIn 2014 a remastered version of \"Monarch\" was released following discovery of the original film negative, previously thought lost. The remastered version premiered on 14 September 2014 at London's Tricycle Theatre. Walsh discussed the issues around finding the lost negatives for \"Monarch\" and other lost projects with BBC Radio 2's Janice Long.\n\nRestoration was completed at Premier. The film scanning and restoration team worked closely with director John Walsh, re-mastering from the original 35mm colour camera negative after it was discovered in a vault almost 20 years after it was originally filmed. In an interview about the project for the BBC, John Walsh explained:\n\nEvery frame of film was scanned in high definition at Premier and had more than 10,000 particles removed by hand by the restoration team. A new sound mix was also created from the original elements in Premier’s in-house audio department. In an article with \"The Weekender\" in November 2017 John discussed the importance restoration and preservation of older films to future-protect film such as \"Monarch\":\n\nThe film received strong reviews on its re-release in 2014 which were in contrast with the poor reviews in 2000. In 2000 Dennis Harvey wrote in Variety that \"\"Monarch\" plays out an OK premise to results at once turgid and ridiculous.\" and describes McKenna's performance as \"hammy\". In 2014 the \"Radio Times\" film critic Jeremy Aspinall called it \"a fascinating, haunting little gem, with a richly nuanced performance from McKenna\".\nThe film's realistic approach was noted by the BBFC who certified it a 15 on the basis that it \"contains strong bloody violence\".\n\n\"Monarch\" was released for the first time on DVD on 7 April 2014 by FremantleMedia. It included extras on the making of the film and the restoration process.

Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and asides. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.\n\nMonologues are similar to poems, epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud. Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea. Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a dialogue interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).\n\nIn ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama, the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus. The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.\n\nAncient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre. One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue. Other monologue types included \"entrance monologues\" and exit monologues. In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.\n\nFrom Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.\n\nInterior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character. Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.\n\nActors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance. These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.\n\n\n\nContemporary Monologues from Published Plays - Monologue Blogger\n"}
{"id": "22348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22348", "title": "Opera", "text": "Opera\n\nOpera (; English plural: \"operas\"; Italian plural: \"opere\" ) is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers. Such a \"work\" (the literal translation of \"opera\") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.\n\nOpera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition. Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater, \"Singspiel\" and \"Opéra comique\". In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and self-contained arias. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama.\n\nOpera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost \"Dafne\", produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his \"reform\" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially \"The Marriage of Figaro\" (\"Le nozze di Figaro\"), \"Don Giovanni\", and \"Così fan tutte\", as well as \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\"), and \"The Magic Flute\" (\"Die Zauberflöte\"), landmarks in the German tradition.\n\nThe first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), Neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and Minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed.\n\nThe words of an opera are known as the libretto (literally \"small book\"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte. Traditional opera, often referred to as \"number opera\", consists of two modes of singing: recitative, the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech, and aria (an \"air\" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as singspiel, opéra comique, operetta, and semi-opera, the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as arioso. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail below. During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: \"secco\" (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by \"basso continuo\", which was usually a harpsichord and a cello; or \"accompagnato\" (also known as \"strumentato\") in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, \"accompagnato\" had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed \"endless melody\". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his \"The Rake's Progress\" have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail below.\n\nThe Italian word \"opera\" means \"work\", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin \"opera\", a singular noun meaning \"work\" and also the plural of the noun \"opus\". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Italian word was first used in the sense \"composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined\" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.\n\n\"Dafne\" by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the \"Camerata de' Bardi\". Significantly, \"Dafne\" was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance. The members of the Camerata considered that the \"chorus\" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of \"restoring\" this situation. \"Dafne,\" however, is lost. A later work by Peri, \"Euridice\", dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to Claudio Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\", composed for the court of Mantua in 1607. The Mantua court of the Gonzagas, employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the concerto delle donne (till 1598), but also one of the first actual \"opera singers\"; Madama Europa.\n\nOpera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a \"season\" (Carnival) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\", for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower Francesco Cavalli helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the Arcadian Academy, which came to be associated with the poet Metastasio, whose libretti helped crystallize the genre of opera seria, which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called opera buffa.\nBefore such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an \"opera-within-an-opera.\" One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell'arte, a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of \"intermezzi\", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.\n\n\"Opera seria\" was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of \"secco\" recitative interspersed with long \"da capo\" arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of \"opera seria\" the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male castrato voice, which was produced by castration of the singer before puberty, which prevented a boy's larynx from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as Farinelli and Senesino, as well as female sopranos such as Faustina Bordoni, became in great demand throughout Europe as \"opera seria\" ruled the stage in every country except France. Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like Handel found himself composing the likes of \"Rinaldo\" and \"Giulio Cesare\" for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the classical period as well, for example in the operas of Mozart, who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of opera seria include Alessandro Scarlatti, Vivaldi and Porpora.\n\nOpera seria had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. Francesco Algarotti's \"Essay on the Opera\" (1755) proved to be an inspiration for Christoph Willibald Gluck's reforms. He advocated that \"opera seria\" had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 Melchior Grimm published \"\", an influential article for the Encyclopédie on lyric and opera librettos. Several composers of the period, including Niccolò Jommelli and Tommaso Traetta, attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a \"beautiful simplicity\". This is evident in his first reform opera, \"Orfeo ed Euridice\", where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.\n\nGluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte, notably \"Le Nozze di Figaro\", \"Don Giovanni\", and \"Così fan tutte\", which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to \"opera seria\" was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as \"Idomeneo\" and \"La clemenza di Tito\", he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.\n\nThe bel canto opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Pacini, Mercadante and many others. Literally \"beautiful singing\", \"bel canto\" opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" and \"La Cenerentola\", as well as Bellini's \"Norma\" and Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\".\nFollowing the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by Giuseppe Verdi, beginning with his biblical opera \"Nabucco\". This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of Italian nationalism in the post-Napoleonic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: \"Rigoletto\", \"Il trovatore\" and \"La traviata\". The first of these, \"Rigoletto\", proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be \"an unending string of duets\". \"La traviata\" was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first \"realistic\" operas, because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French Grand Opera, \"Don Carlos\", and ending his career with two Shakespeare-inspired works, \"Otello\" and \"Falstaff\", which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In \"Falstaff\", Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, \"Falstaff\" contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors Giacomo Puccini, Richard Strauss, and Benjamin Britten.\n\nAfter Verdi, the sentimental \"realistic\" melodrama of verismo appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" and Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as Giacomo Puccini's \"La bohème\", \"Tosca\", and \"Madama Butterfly\". Later Italian composers, such as Berio and Nono, have experimented with modernism.\n\nThe first German opera was \"Dafne\", composed by Heinrich Schütz in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, Sigmund Staden produced the first \"Singspiel\", \"Seelewig\", a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in Hamburg presented German operas by Keiser, Telemann and Handel. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as Graun, Hasse and later Gluck, chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.\n\nMozart's \"Singspiele\", \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (1782) and \"Die Zauberflöte\" (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by Beethoven with his \"Fidelio\", inspired by the climate of the French Revolution. Carl Maria von Weber established German Romantic opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian bel canto. His \"Der Freischütz\" (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include Marschner, Schubert and Lortzing, but the most significant figure was undoubtedly Wagner.\n\nWagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of Weber and Meyerbeer, he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" (a \"complete work of art\"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of leitmotifs, recurring themes often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as \"Der fliegende Holländer\", \"Tannhäuser\" and \"Lohengrin\"; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as tonality, in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, \"Tristan und Isolde\", \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\", \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" and \"Parsifal\", he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of \"endless melody\". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from Germanic or Arthurian legend. Finally, Wagner built his own opera house at Bayreuth with part of the patronage from Ludwig II of Bavaria, exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.\n\nOpera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, Richard Strauss accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous \"Salome\" and the dark tragedy \"Elektra\", in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, \"Der Rosenkavalier\", where Mozart and Viennese waltzes became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include Alexander von Zemlinsky, Erich Korngold, Franz Schreker, Paul Hindemith, Kurt Weill and the Italian-born Ferruccio Busoni. The operatic innovations of Arnold Schoenberg and his successors are discussed in the section on modernism.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II, an admirer of the French-language operettas composed by Jacques Offenbach, composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was \"Die Fledermaus\", which is still regularly performed today. Nevertheless, rather than copying the style of Offenbach, the operettas of Strauss II had distinctly Viennese flavor to them, which have cemented the Strauss II's place as one of the most renowned operetta composers of all time.\n\nIn rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of King Louis XIV. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an Academy of Music and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with \"Cadmus et Hermione\", Lully and his librettist Quinault created \"tragédie en musique\", a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive recitative which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was Jean-Philippe Rameau, who composed five \"tragédies en musique\" as well as numerous works in other genres such as opéra-ballet, all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian opera seria throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead. After Rameau's death, the German Gluck was persuaded to produce six operas for the Parisian stage in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: \"opéra comique\". This was the equivalent of the German singspiel, where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by Monsigny, Philidor and, above all, Grétry. During the Revolutionary period, composers such as Méhul and Cherubini, who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly \"comic\" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. Gossec's \"Le triomphe de la République\" (1793).\nBy the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian bel canto, especially after the arrival of Rossini in Paris. Rossini's \"Guillaume Tell\" helped found the new genre of Grand Opera, a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, Giacomo Meyerbeer. Meyerbeer's works, such as \"Les Huguenots\", emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter \"opéra comique\" also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of Boïeldieu, Auber, Hérold and Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece \"Les Troyens\", the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Jacques Offenbach created operetta with witty and cynical works such as \"Orphée aux enfers\", as well as the opera \"Les Contes d'Hoffmann\"; Charles Gounod scored a massive success with \"Faust\"; and Georges Bizet composed \"Carmen\", which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of Romanticism and realism, became the most popular of all opéra comiques. Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns and Léo Delibes all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's \"Manon\", Saint-Saëns' \"Samson et Dalila\" and Delibes' \"Lakmé\". Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique. At the same time, the influence of Richard Wagner was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from Claude Debussy. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.\n\nOther notable 20th-century names include Ravel, Dukas, Roussel and Milhaud. Francis Poulenc is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include \"Dialogues des Carmélites\") have gained a foothold in the international repertory. Olivier Messiaen's lengthy sacred drama \"Saint François d'Assise\" (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.\n\nIn England, opera's antecedent was the 17th-century \"jig\". This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently libellous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French masque was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. Inigo Jones became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In Ben Jonson's \"Lovers Made Men\" (1617), \"the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo\". The approach of the English Commonwealth closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the dramatist Sir William Davenant produced \"The Siege of Rhodes\". Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by \"The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru\" (1658) and \"The History of Sir Francis Drake\" (1659). These pieces were encouraged by Oliver Cromwell because they were critical of Spain. With the English Restoration, foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, Thomas Shadwell's \"Psyche\", patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by Molière and Jean-Baptiste Lully. William Davenant produced \"The Tempest\" in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a Shakespeare play (composed by Locke and Johnson). About 1683, John Blow composed \"Venus and Adonis\", often thought of as the first true English-language opera.\n\nBlow's immediate successor was the better known Henry Purcell. Despite the success of his masterwork \"Dido and Aeneas\" (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the semi-opera format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as Shakespeare in Purcell's \"The Fairy-Queen\" (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in \"The Prophetess\" (1690) and \"Bonduca\" (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator John Dryden) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.\nFollowing Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne, both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being \"Thomas and Sally\" in 1760. His opera \"Artaxerxes\" (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, \"Love in a Village\" (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Charles Burney wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\".\n\nBesides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was George Frideric Handel, whose \"opera serias\" filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like John Frederick Lampe, who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of Michael William Balfe, and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.\n\nThe only exceptions were ballad operas, such as John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" (1728), musical burlesques, European operettas, and late Victorian era light operas, notably the Savoy Operas of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\" (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876), but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of \"English\" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's \"Daily Telegraph\" agreed, describing \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" as \"a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage\". Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&S series, including \"Haddon Hall\" and \"The Beauty Stone\", but \"Ivanhoe\" (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record until Broadway's \"La bohème\") survives as his only Grand Opera.\n\nIn the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of Ralph Vaughan Williams and in particular Benjamin Britten, who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently Sir Harrison Birtwistle has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera \"Punch and Judy\" to his most recent critical success in The Minotaur. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, Michael Nyman, has been focusing on composing operas, including \"Facing Goya\", \"\", and \"Love Counts\". Today composers such as Thomas Adès continue to export English opera abroad.\n\nAlso in the 20th century, American composers like Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, Gian Carlo Menotti, Douglas Moore, and Carlisle Floyd began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as Philip Glass, Mark Adamo, John Corigliano, Robert Moran, John Coolidge Adams, André Previn and Jake Heggie.\n\nOpera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the Italian operatic troupes and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and aristocracy. Many foreign composers such as Baldassare Galuppi, Giovanni Paisiello, Giuseppe Sarti, and Domenico Cimarosa (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the Italian language. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like Maksym Berezovsky and Dmitry Bortniansky were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was \"Tsefal i Prokris\" by the Italian composer Francesco Araja (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers Vasily Pashkevich, Yevstigney Fomin and Alexey Verstovsky.\n\nHowever, the real birth of Russian opera came with Mikhail Glinka and his two great operas \"A Life for the Tsar\" (1836) and \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as \"Rusalka\" and \"The Stone Guest\" by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, \"Boris Godunov\" and \"Khovanshchina\" by Modest Mussorgsky, \"Prince Igor\" by Alexander Borodin, \"Eugene Onegin\" and \"The Queen of Spades\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and \"The Snow Maiden\" and \"Sadko\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian nationalism across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general Slavophilism movement.\n\nIn the 20th century, the traditions of Russian opera were developed by many composers including Sergei Rachmaninoff in his works \"The Miserly Knight\" and \"Francesca da Rimini\", Igor Stravinsky in \"Le Rossignol\", \"Mavra\", \"Oedipus rex\", and \"The Rake's Progress\", Sergei Prokofiev in \"The Gambler\", \"The Love for Three Oranges\", \"The Fiery Angel\", \"Betrothal in a Monastery\", and \"War and Peace\"; as well as Dmitri Shostakovich in \"The Nose\" and \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\", Edison Denisov in \"L'écume des jours\", and Alfred Schnittke in \"Life with an Idiot\" and \"Historia von D. Johann Fausten\".\n\nSpain also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as zarzuela, which had two separate flowerings: one from the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, and another beginning around 1850. During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.\n\nCzech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with Bedřich Smetana, who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular \"The Bartered Bride\". Antonín Dvořák, most famous for \"Rusalka\", wrote 13 operas; and Leoš Janáček gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including \"Jenůfa\", \"The Cunning Little Vixen\", and \"Káťa Kabanová\".\n\nIn Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky (1813–1873) whose most famous work \"Zaporozhets za Dunayem\" (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include Mykola Lysenko (\"Taras Bulba\" and \"Natalka Poltavka\"), Heorhiy Maiboroda, and Yuliy Meitus. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in Georgia under the leadership Zacharia Paliashvili, who fused local folk songs and stories with 19th-century Romantic classical themes.\nThe key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was Ferenc Erkel, whose works mostly dealt with historical themes. Among his most often performed operas are \"Hunyadi László\" and \"Bánk bán\". The most famous modern Hungarian opera is Béla Bartók's \"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\".\n\nStanisław Moniuszko's opera \"Straszny Dwór\" (in English \"The Haunted Manor\") (1861–64) represents a nineteenth-century peak of Polish national opera. In the 20th century, other operas created by Polish composers included \"King Roger\" by Karol Szymanowski and \"Ubu Rex\" by Krzysztof Penderecki.\n\nThe first known opera from Turkey (the Ottoman Empire) was \"Arshak II\", which was an Armenian opera composed by an ethnic Armenian composer Tigran Tchoukhajian in 1868 and partially performed in 1873. It was fully staged in 1945 in Armenia.\n\nThe first years of the Soviet Union saw the emergence of new national operas, such as the \"Koroğlu\" (1937) by the Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. The first Kyrgyz opera, \"Ai-Churek\", premiered in Moscow at the Bolshoi Theatre on 26 May 1939, during Kyrgyz Art Decade. It was composed by Vladimir Vlasov, Abdylas Maldybaev and Vladimir Fere. The libretto was written by Joomart Bokonbaev, Jusup Turusbekov, and Kybanychbek Malikov. The opera is based on the Kyrgyz heroic epic \"Manas\".\n\nChinese contemporary classical opera, a Chinese language form of Western style opera that is distinct from traditional Chinese opera, has had operas dating back to \"The White Haired Girl\" in 1945.\n\nIn Latin America, opera started as a result of European colonisation. The first opera ever written in the Americas was \"La púrpura de la rosa\", by Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco, although \"Partenope\", by the Mexican Manuel de Zumaya, was the first opera written from a composer born in Latin America (music now lost). The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was \"A Noite de São João\", by Elias Álvares Lobo. However, Antonio Carlos Gomes is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as \"Il Guarany\". Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires—with the opera \"Aurora\", by Ettore Panizza, being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include Felipe Boero and Alberto Ginastera.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of atonality. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with Richard Wagner, and in particular the Tristan chord. Composers such as Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy, Giacomo Puccini, Paul Hindemith, Benjamin Britten and Hans Pfitzner pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by Giuseppe Verdi in his \"Falstaff\". Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.\nOperatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, Arnold Schoenberg and his student Alban Berg, both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), dodecaphony. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, \"Erwartung\" (1909, premiered in 1924) and \"Die glückliche Hand\" display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used Sprechstimme.\n\nThe two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, \"Wozzeck\" (1925) and \"Lulu\" (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.\n\nComposers thus influenced include the Englishman Benjamin Britten, the German Hans Werner Henze, and the Russian Dmitri Shostakovich. (Philip Glass also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as minimalist, usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)\n\nHowever, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of neoclassicism. An early leader of this movement was Ferruccio Busoni, who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical number opera \"Arlecchino\" (first performed in 1917). Also among the vanguard was the Russian Igor Stravinsky. After composing music for the Diaghilev-produced ballets \"Petrushka\" (1911) and \"The Rite of Spring\" (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio \"Oedipus Rex\" (1927). Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including \"Renard\" (1916: \"a burlesque in song and dance\") and \"The Soldier's Tale\" (1918: \"to be read, played, and danced\"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of \"Melodrama\". Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works \"The Nightingale\" (1914), and \"Mavra\" (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore serialist technique and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style diatonic number opera \"The Rake's Progress\" (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many other composers.\n\nA common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of Benjamin Britten's operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; Mark Adamo's two-act realization of \"Little Women\" is scored for 18 instrumentalists.\n\nAnother feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. \"The Death of Klinghoffer\", \"Nixon in China\", and \"Doctor Atomic\" by John Adams, \"Dead Man Walking\" by Jake Heggie, and \"Anna Nicole\" by Mark-Anthony Turnage exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60. Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for classical music since the last decades of the 20th century. In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.\n\nSmaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a \"patchwork quilt\" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers. Nevertheless, some smaller companies have found ways of drawing new audiences. Opera Carolina offer discounts and happy hour events to the 21- to 40-year-old demographic. In addition to radio and television broadcasts of opera performances, which have had some success in gaining new audiences, broadcasts of live performances in HD to movie theatres have shown the potential to reach new audiences. Since 2006, the Met has broadcast live performances to several hundred movie screens all over the world.\n\nBy the late 1930s, some musicals began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935), influenced by jazz styles, and \"Candide\" (1956), with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on Broadway but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. Popular musicals such as \"Show Boat\", \"West Side Story\", \"Brigadoon\", \"\", \"Passion\", \"Evita\", \"The Light in the Piazza\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses. \"The Most Happy Fella\" (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the New York City Opera. Other rock influenced musicals, such as \"Tommy\" (1969) and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (1971), \"Les Misérables\" (1980), \"Rent\" (1996), \"Spring Awakening\" (2006), and \"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\" (2012) employ various operatic conventions, such as through composition, recitative instead of dialogue, and leitmotifs.\n\nA subtle type of sound electronic reinforcement called acoustic enhancement is used in some modern concert halls and theatres where operas are performed. Although none of the major opera houses \"...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre\", many use a sound reinforcement system for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in \"Tosca\" or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).\n\nOperatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.\n\nSingers and the roles they play are classified by voice type, based on the tessitura, agility, power and timbre of their voices. Male singers can be classified by vocal range as bass, bass-baritone, baritone, tenor and countertenor, and female singers as contralto, mezzo-soprano and soprano. (Men sometimes sing in the \"female\" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed sopranist or countertenor. The countertenor is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for castrati—men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by size—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, coloratura, soubrette, spinto, or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.\n\nYet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the \"Basso Buffo\" who often must be a specialist in patter as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the \"Fach\" system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken drama were often put on by the same repertory company.\n\nA particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, \"premiere dugazon\" and \"deuxieme dugazon\", were named after successive stages in the career of Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the Parisian theatres are \"baryton-martin\" and soprano \"falcon\".\n\nThe soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a castrato. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the Classical period. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high A (Handel, for example, only wrote one role extending to a high C), though the castrato Farinelli was alleged to possess a top D (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's \"Dido and Aeneas\" to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing \"witches, bitches, and britches\" roles. In recent years many of the \"trouser roles\" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.\n\nThe tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the \"bel canto\" era, such as Donizetti's sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during \"La fille du régiment\". With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as \"Heldentenor\"; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's \"Turandot\". Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in \"opera seria\" in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in \"Don Giovanni\" to the nobility of Wotan in Wagner's \"Ring Cycle,\" to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's \"Don Carlos\". In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's \"Così fan tutte\" to Posa in Verdi's \"Don Carlos\"; the actual designation \"baritone\" was not standard until the mid-19th century.\n\nEarly performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a castrato, and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as Senesino and Farinelli, became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or prima donna), Anna Renzi, dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with Faustina Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni, who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an haute-contre (a high tenor), of which Joseph Legros (1739–1793) was a leading example.\nThough opera patronage has decreased in the last century in favor of other arts and media (such as musicals, cinema, radio, television and recordings), mass media and the advent of recording have supported the popularity of many famous singers including Maria Callas, Enrico Caruso, Amelita Galli-Curci, Kirsten Flagstad, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres,\nMario Del Monaco, Risë Stevens, Alfredo Kraus, Franco Corelli, Montserrat Caballé, Joan Sutherland, Birgit Nilsson, Nellie Melba, Rosa Ponselle, Beniamino Gigli, Jussi Björling, Feodor Chaliapin, Cecilia Bartoli, Renée Fleming, Marilyn Horne, Bryn Terfel and \"The Three Tenors\" (Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo, and José Carreras).\n\nBefore the 1700s, Italian operas used a small string orchestra, but it rarely played to accompany the singers. Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the basso continuo group, which consisted of the harpsichord, \"plucked instruments\" such as lute and a bass instrument. The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's \"...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing\". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral ritornello to mark the end of a singer's solo. During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives \"...as special\"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as Domenico Sarro, Leonardo Vinci, Giambattista Pergolesi, Leonardo Leo, and Johann Adolf Hasse added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.\n\nThe orchestra has also provided an instrumental overture before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. Peri's \"Euridice\" opens with a brief instrumental ritornello, and Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) opens with a toccata, in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets. The French overture as found in Jean-Baptiste Lully's operas consist of a slow introduction in a marked \"dotted rhythm\", followed by a lively movement in fugato style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in Henry Purcell's \"Dido and Aeneas\". Handel also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as Giulio Cesare.\n\nIn Italy, a distinct form called \"overture\" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of Alessandro Scarlatti, and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century. It uses three generally homophonic movements: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the gigue or minuet, and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called \"sonatina form\" (sonata form without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.\n\nIn Italian opera after about 1800, the \"overture\" became known as the \"sinfonia\". Fisher also notes the term \"Sinfonia avanti l'opera\" (literally, the \"symphony before the opera\") was \"an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work\". In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, \"Vorspiel\", \"Einleitung\", Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.\n\nThe role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The orchestration of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as \"Tristan\", the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or leitmotifs, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which \"...elevated its status to that of a prima donna.\" Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to \"Das Rheingold\" calls for six harps.\n\nAs the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the concertmaster, would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of music director became termed the conductor, and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the orchestra pit and the singers up on stage.\n\nSince the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" or \"Don Carlos\" are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.\n\nTill the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian. After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers.\"The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship,\" explains mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick. \"[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called surtitles) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction, today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's proscenium arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a RAI broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.\n\nToday, operas are only rarely performed in translation. Exceptions include the English National Opera, the Opera Theater of St. Louis, Opera Theater of Pittsburgh, and Opera South East, which favor English translations. Another exception are opera productions intended for a young audience, such as Humperdinck's \"Hansel and Gretel\" and some productions of Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nOutside the US, and especially in Europe, most opera houses receive public subsidies from taxpayers. In Milan, Italy, 60% of La Scala's annual budget of €115 million is from ticket sales and private donations, with the remaining 40% coming from public funds. In 2005, La Scala received 25% of Italy's total state subsidy of €464 million for the performing arts. In the UK, Arts Council England provides funds to Opera North, the Royal Opera House, Welsh National Opera, and English National Opera. Between 2012 and 2015, these four opera companies along with the English National Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and Northern Ballet accounted for 22% of the funds in the Arts Council's national portfolio. During that period, the Council undertook an analysis of its funding for large-scale opera and ballet companies, setting recommendations and targets for the companies to meet prior to the 2015–2018 funding decisions. In February 2015, concerns over English National Opera's business plan led to the Arts Council placing it \"under special funding arrangements\" in what \"The Independent\" termed \"the unprecedented step\" of threatening to withdraw public funding if the Council's concerns were not met by 2017. European public funding to opera has led to a disparity between the number of year-round opera houses in Europe and the United States. For example, \"Germany has about 80 year-round opera houses [as of 2004], while the U.S., with more than three times the population, does not have any. Even the Met only has a seven-month season.\"\n\nA milestone for opera broadcasting in the U.S. was achieved on December 24, 1951, with the live broadcast of \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\", an opera in one act by Gian Carlo Menotti. It was the first opera specifically composed for television in America. Another milestone occurred in Italy in 1992 when \"Tosca\" was broadcast live from its original Roman settings and times of the day: The first act came from the 16th-century Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at noon on Saturday; the 16th-century Palazzo Farnese was the setting for the second at 8:15 P.M.; and on Sunday at 6 A.M., the third act was broadcast from Castel Sant'Angelo. The production was transmitted via satellite to 105 countries.\n\nMajor opera companies have begun presenting their performances in local cinemas throughout the United States and many other countries. The Metropolitan Opera began a series of live high-definition video transmissions to cinemas around the world in 2006. In 2007, Met performances were shown in over 424 theaters in 350 U.S. cities. \"La bohème\" went out to 671 screens worldwide. San Francisco Opera began prerecorded video transmissions in March 2008. As of June 2008, approximately 125 theaters in 117 U.S. cities carry the showings. The HD video opera transmissions are presented via the same HD digital cinema projectors used for major Hollywood films. European opera houses and festivals including the Royal Opera in London, La Scala in Milan, the Salzburg Festival, La Fenice in Venice, and the Maggio Musicale in Florence have also transmitted their productions to theaters in cities around the world since 2006, including 90 cities in the U.S.\n\nThe emergence of the Internet has also affected the way in which audiences consume opera. In 2009 the British Glyndebourne Festival Opera offered for the first time an online digital video download of its complete 2007 production of \"Tristan und Isolde\". In 2013 season the festival streamed all six of its productions online. In July 2012 the first online community opera was premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival. Titled \"Free Will\", it was created by members of the Internet group Opera By You. Its 400 members from 43 countries wrote the libretto, composed the music, and designed the sets and costumes using the Wreckamovie web platform. Savonlinna Opera Festival provided professional soloists, an 80-member choir, a symphony orchestra, and the stage machinery. It was performed live at the festival and streamed live on the internet.\n\nNotes\nMain sources\n\nOther sources\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1797969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797969", "title": "Pink Floyd pigs", "text": "Pink Floyd pigs\n\nInflatable flying pigs were one of the staple props of Pink Floyd's live shows. The first was a sow, but a very obviously male pig appeared in the 1980s. Pigs appeared numerous times in concerts by the band, promoting concerts and record releases, and on the cover of their 1977 album \"Animals\".\n\nThe image rights for the pigs passed to Roger Waters when he split from the rest of the group, though the pigs continued to be used by both post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and Roger Waters in their gigs.\n\nThe original Pink Floyd pig was designed by Roger Waters and built in December 1976 by the artist Jeffrey Shaw with help of design team Hipgnosis, in preparation for shooting the cover of the \"Animals\" album. Plans were made to fly the , helium-filled balloon over Battersea Power Station on the first day's photo-shoot, with a marksman prepared to shoot the pig down if it broke free. However, the pig was not launched.\n\nOn the second day, the marksman wasn't present because no one had told him to return. The pig broke free due to a strong gust of wind on the third day, gaining a lot of press coverage. It disappeared from sight within five minutes, and was spotted by airline pilots at thirty thousand feet in the air. Flights at Heathrow Airport were cancelled as the huge inflatable pig flew through the path of aircraft, eastwards from Britain and out over the English Channel, finally landing on a rural farm in Kent that night.\n\nThe pig was recovered and repaired for the resumption of photography for the album cover, but the sky was cloudless and blue, thus \"boring\". However, the pictures of the sky from the first day were suitable; eventually, the album cover was created using a composite of photos from the first and third days.\n\nThe pig that was originally floated above Battersea Power Station was called \"Algie\".\n\nAfter the album \"Animals\" was released in 1977, Pink Floyd began their \"In the Flesh\" tour. During concerts, the pig appeared around the PA stacks in a cloud of black smoke during performances of \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\".\n\nThe pig also appeared during each of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" concerts, black instead of pink, with a crossed hammers logo on its side. Waters would occasionally refer to it directly before \"Run Like Hell\" (the pig appeared during the end of the previous song, \"In the Flesh\"). A short speech in reference to either the pig or the song was given in every show, with each speech being different; this oddity is used by bootleggers to identify which date a recording of the Wall tour was made on. At the Berlin concert, it was only the head and it had fangs and red eyes.\n\nFor the 1987/88/89 tour, the band added testicles to the pig. David Gilmour has said this was an attempt to get around Roger Waters having the image rights for the pig.\n\nPink Floyd added a 'deflated' pig to Roger Waters's auction of animation art from the film \"The Wall\" at Christie's London on 21 September 1990, the lot was withdrawn before the auction started.\n\nDuring the 1994 tour, two warthog-like pigs with protruding tongues were shown at the top of the stage side's speaker towers, sometimes just deflated, sometimes dropped on the ground after \"One of These Days\". This was also during Pulse, but for the VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases, footage of the pigs falling was edited out.\n\nThe pig made another appearance before the release of \"\", when Capitol Records flew a replica of the original pig from \"Animals\" over the Capitol Records Tower in Hollywood, California.\n\nOne damaged inflatable pig, believed to be from the 1988 Pink Floyd tour, was repaired by Nga Keith and flown again over a concert by the band The String Cheese Incident in Austin, Texas on 20 September 2003. Reportedly purchased by The String Cheese Incident manager Mike Luba from a former Pink Floyd stagehand, the 40-foot pig flew again over the Austin City Limits Music Festival audience during a cover of Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\".\n\nDuring their Live 8 reunion with Waters, footage of Algie, over Battersea Power Station, was shown on a giant video screen behind the band.\n\nA replica of Algie was tethered above Battersea Power Station on 26 September 2011 to promote the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, involving the reissue of the band's first 14 studio albums.\n\n\n\n"}

The concept was introduced by Mikhail Bakhtin, using a metaphor based on the musical term polyphony.\n\nBakhtin's primary example of polyphony was Fyodor Dostoevsky's prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or describe situations with a 'monological' authorial voice. Instead, he aimed for fully dramatic novels of ideas in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly. According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels is \"a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices\". His major characters are, \"by the very nature of his creative design, \"not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.\"\" (italics in the original)\n\n\n\n"}

In his book, \"Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption\" (1999), author George Ritzer describes \"retailtainment\" as the \"use of ambience, emotion, sound and activity to get customers interested in the merchandise and in a mood to buy.\"\n\nSometimes called \"inspirational retailing\" or \"entertailing,\" it has also been defined as \"the modern trend of combining shopping and entertainment opportunities as an anchor for customers.\"\n\nIn 2001, Codeluppi described it as a way for marketers to \"offer the consumer physical and emotional sensations during the shopping experience.\" And, in an article entitled \"Using sonic branding in the retail environment\" in the 2003 issue of the \"Journal of Consumer Behavior\", Fulberg described it as a way for retailers to entertain the consumer with a dramatization of their values.\"\n\nAccording to Michael Morrison at the Australian Centre for Retail Studies:\n\n“There is a move towards the concept of 'retailtainment.' This phenomenon, which brings together retailing, entertainment, music and leisure ... Retailers need to look further than the traditional retail store elements such as colour, lighting and visual merchandising to influence buying decisions. The specific atmosphere the retailer creates can, in some cases, be more influential in the decision-making process than the product itself. As goods and services become more of a commodity, it is what a shopper experiences and what atmosphere retailers create that really matters. Brand building is a combination of physical, functional, operational and psychological elements. Consumers will be willing to pay more for a brand if there is a perceived or actual added value from their experience of using the product or service.”\nShopper marketing expert Simon Temperley of Los Angeles agency The Marketing Arm, formerly U.S. Marketing & Promotions (Usmp), describes \"retailtainment\" as a \"live brand experience\" that frequently includes the use of \"brand ambassadors\" who \"converse with the consumer.\"\n"}

For example, the film \"Dances with Wolves\" may be regarded as a revisionist western because it portrays Native Americans sympathetically instead of as the savages of traditional westerns. \nMany original works of fantasy appear to retell fairy tales in a revisionist manner.

An example is \"Hamlet\" 3.4, when Hamlet confronts his mother.\n\n"}
{"id": "401969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401969", "title": "Secret history", "text": "Secret history\n\nA secret history (or shadow history) is a revisionist interpretation of either fictional or real history which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. \"Secret history\" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.\n\nOriginally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the \"spin\": one such example is \"The Secret History of the Mongols\". Secret histories can range from standard historical revisionism with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to negative historical revisionism wherein facts are deliberately omitted, suppressed or distorted.\n\nThe quintessential example secret history is the \"Anecdota\" of Procopius of Caesarea (known for centuries as the \"Secret History\"). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the Vatican Library and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the \"Suda\", which referred to it as the \"Anekdota\" (\"the unpublished composition\"). The \"Secret History\" covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the \"History of Justinian's Wars\" and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the Roman Emperor Justinian I to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.\n\nSecret history is sometimes used in a long-running science fiction or fantasy universe to preserve continuity with the present by reconciling paranormal, anachronistic, or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the \"Star Trek\" universe, Greg Cox's novels \"\" cast the devastating Eugenics Wars of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the Smiling Buddha nuclear test, the Yugoslav Wars during the 1990s, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots were all part of one wider conflict.\n\nA certain type of thriller can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando \"nearly\" carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not alternate history but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.\n\nTwo highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:\n\n\nThese two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.\n\nMany other novels of this type followed, most of them with World War II backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:\n\nWorks of other writers fitting within this type include:\n\nDifferent types of secret history thriller include:\n\n\n\n\n\"Retcon\", alteration of the canonical account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming continuity breach might be \"revealed\" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running superhero comic books.\n\n\nThe plots of some Time travel books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.\n\nFor example, Poul Anderson's story \"Brave to be a King\" asserts that King Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire, was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is \"cancelled out\" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, \"The Sorrow of Odin the Goth\", asserts that also the Nordic god Odin/Wodan was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient Goths and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. \n\nPaul Levinson's \"The Plot to Save Socrates\" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher Socrates did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general Alcibiades had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous fourth-century mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor Hero of Alexandria was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the nineteenth-century publisher William Henry Appleton had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited Classical Greece and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.\n\nAccording to David Drake's novel \"Birds of Prey\", the Roman Empire's Third Century Crisis was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named Diocletian, realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.\n\nRay Nelson's novel \"Bĺake's Progress\" assumes that the poet William Blake and his wife Kate were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various alternate timelines, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of John Milton, the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. William Blake's mythology is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character Urizen was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.\n\n"}

These groups worked similarly to tawaifs.\n\nRussian painter Grigory Gagarin who lived in the Caucasus in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as \"bayaderki\" (баядерки; sg. \"bayaderka\" – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term \"balliadera\" borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (\"bayadère\") and initially used to refer to the devadasi.)\n\nThe extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in Comte de Gobineau's novel \"The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales\".\n\n\"The Dancer of Shamakha\" recounts the life of Armenian dancer Armen Ohanian, her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as \"La Danseuse de Shamakha\" in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by Rose Wilder. After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles. She eventually moved to Mexico. She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "272955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272955", "title": "Singing telegram", "text": "Singing telegram\n\nA singing telegram is a message that is delivered by an artist in a musical form. Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal telegrams, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing. Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.\n\nWestern Union, the American telegraph company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star Rudy Vallee a birthday greeting by telegram. George P. Oslin (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular. He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram. While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought \"that messages should be fun,\" he recalled that he \"was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company.\"\n\nAs relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering. Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.\n\nA DIY singing telegram is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.\n\nA kissogram, also called kissagram (short for kissing telegram), is a message delivered along with a kiss, usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an agency. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a police officer, nurse, french maid or nun. This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. \n\nA stripogram or strippergram is a form of message delivery in which a stripper will perform a striptease while singing or dancing. The word is a combination of telegram and striptease. This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s. Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a birthday, anniversary or bachelor party. A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to Florists' Transworld Delivery, the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.\n\nIn the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife. \n\nIn the 1985 movie \"Brazil\", Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.\n\nIn \"Clue\", 1985, a singing telegram (Jane Wiedlin) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. \n\nIn a classic episode of Sesame Street, Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to Mr. Johnson singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.\n\nIn the 1987 MacGyver episode \"Soft Touch\", Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.\n\nIn \"The Fisher King\", 1991, Parry (Robin Williams) sends a singing telegram (Michael Jeter) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.\n\nIn the 2010 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Eleventh Hour\", the Doctor's companion Amy Pond worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5067325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5067325", "title": "Solo performance", "text": "Solo performance\n\nA solo performance, sometimes referred to as a one-man show or one-woman show, features a single person telling a story for an audience, typically for the purpose of entertainment. This type of performance comes in many varieties, including autobiographical creations, comedy acts, novel adaptations, vaudeville, poetry, music, and dance.\n\nSolo performance is used to encompass the broad term of a single person performing for an audience. Some key traits of solo performance can include the lack of the fourth wall and audience participation or involvement. Solo performance does not need to be written, performed, and produced by a single person-- a solo performance production may utilize directors, writers, designers, and composers to bring the piece to life on a stage. An example of this collaboration is Eric Bogosian in the published version of his show \"Wake Up And Smell the Coffee\", by Theatre Communications Group, New York City. \n\nIt is assumed that individuals have told stories in front of other members of their tribe or society for thousands of years. They would have orally passed down many of today's myths and legends in this manner. So it is a style of performance that has been with us for generations developing through theatrical people such as Greek Monologists, the strolling Minstrels of Medieval England and the French Troubadors.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe both lectured and recited poetry as a platform performer between 1843 and 1849; his performances stand as a paradigm of the solo performance hybrid simply called \"the lecture-recital\". The reading tours of Charles Dickens in Britain and America between 1858 and 1870 created a sensation. His American tour of 1867–68 was unparalleled until the arrival of the Beatles in the early 1960s.\n\nSolo performance enjoyed an unprecedented artistic and commercial vogue in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century (John S. Gentile Calls it the golden age of platform performance). Literary historians often associate the Victorian period with the highest development of the dramatic monologue as a poetic form. There were several discussions about the importance and distinction between the literary monologue and the performance monologue during the nineteenth century, however, this discussions confirms a continuous interchange between literature and performance, which may at times appear competitive but is more often productive. By the time the United States entered the 20th century, the number and variety of professional solo performances presented throughout the country had grown large. This renaissance of solo performance also created ripples in the larger sense of American theatre; after this \"boom\" of the one man show had passed, the presentational style seeped into popular theatre productions such as \"Amadeus\", \"Equus\", and \"Evita\" among others, modeling a combination of representational theatricality and presentational, direct-address style.\n\nBy the 1960s, the term performance art became popular and involved any number of performance acts or happenings, as they were known. Many performers, like Laurie Anderson, developed through these happenings and are still performing today.\n\nThe backgrounds of solo performers over the decades range from vaudeville, comedy, poetry, music, the visual arts, magic, cabaret, theatre and dance.\n\nSolo performers include Lily Tomlin, Andy Kaufman, Rod Maxwell, Lord Buckley, Eric Bogosian, Whoopi Goldberg, Jade Esteban Estrada, Eddie Izzard, John Leguizamo, Marga Gomez, Anna Deavere Smith, Bill Hicks, Brother Blue and Lenny Bruce.\n\nSeveral performers have presented solo shows in tribute to famous personalities. The blueprint for this type of show may have been drafted by Hal Holbrook, who has performed as Mark Twain in his solo show, \"Mark Twain Tonight\", more than 2,000 times since 1954. Examples since that time include Julie Harris in the Emily Dickinson biography, \"The Belle of Amherst\"; Tovah Feldshuh as Golda Meir in \"Golda's Balcony\"; Frank Gorshin as George Burns in \"Say Goodnight Gracie\" by Rupert Holmes; Ed Metzger in his solo show, performing since 1978, \"\"; Metzger in another solo performance, \"\"; Henry Fonda as Clarence Darrow in \"Darrow\", and Tom Dugan as Simon Wiesenthal in \"Wiesenthal\".\n\nA few actors adapted entire novels for the stage including Patrick Stewart who played all 43 parts in his version of \"A Christmas Carol\", which played three times on Broadway and atThe Old Vic in London; actor Gerald Charles Dickens played 26 characters in his performances from the same work; and Jack Aranson starred in a solo, 13-character production of \"Moby Dick\".\n\nSolo performance may be personal, autobiographical creations. This ranges from the intensely confessional but comedic work of Spalding Gray, the semi-autobiographical \"A Bronx Tale\" by Chaz Palminteri, or Holly Hughes' solo piece \"World without End,\" in which she attempts to make sense of her relationship with her mother who had died. Another example of this is \"In The Body of the World,\" written and performed by Eve Ensler in 2018.\n\nStill other shows may rally around a central theme, such as pop culture in Pat Hazel's \"The Wonderbread Years\", relationships in Robert Dubac's \"The Male Intellect\", the history of the New York City transit system in Mike Daisey's \"Invincible Summer\", or fighting the system in Patrick Combs' \"Man 1, Bank 0\". these themes could also be centered around a certain topic such as a political or social issue. Tim Miller explores the topic of gay culture and society surrounding the LGBTQ community in his production of \"My Queer Body\". Karen Finley expressed her frustration with the standards women are held to and the issues surrounding them such as rape and abortion in her solo piece titled \"We Keep Our Victims Ready\".\n\nSometimes, solo shows are simply traditional plays written by playwrights for a cast of one. Examples: \"Shirley Valentine\" by Willy Russell, \"I Am My Own Wife\" by Doug Wright, \"The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead\" by Robert Hewett and \"Topless\" by Miles Tredinnick. A performer of shows of this type is Chris Harris, whose performances in the genre include \"Kemp's Jig\", \"That's The Way To Do It!\", \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\", \"Beemaster\", \"'Arris Music 'All\" and \"A Night at the Pantomime\".\n\nThere have also been many British comedians who have moved away from performing pure stand-up comedy in recent years. The shows that appear annually at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe can involve stories of pathos and the use of technological equipment such as projectors. Examples include Howard Read, who has performed with the animated character Little Howard which was projected with the aid of computers and Dave Gorman, who has performed several shows described as \"documentary comedy\".\n\nThe First full-length talking film who showed only a single character was Sofi, a 1968 film starring Tom Troupe. The film was based on \"Diary of a Madman\" by Gogol.\nIn the 21st century the \"solo performance\" had a rejuvenation period. with films like Locke, All Is Lost and Buried. The characteristics were different from the previous one character films that were made - mainly by location and style. Sofi and works like Give 'em Hell, Harry!, were still studio filmed theater pieces. The 21th century films were mostly shot on location and were much more stylized with their cinematic expression and camera usage. Most recently films by Marcus Tell showed ongoing characteristics of one character films. \n\n\n\n\n\"Latin History for Morons.\" Broadway.com, www.broadway.com/shows/latin-history-moron/.\n\n\"In the Body of the world.\" In the Body of the World, Manhattan Theatre Club, bodyoftheworldplay.com/\n\nIsherwood, Charles. \"'Emergence-SEE!' - Theater - Review.\" \"The New York Times\", The New York Times, 23 Oct. 2006, www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/theater/reviews/23emer.html.\n\nRimalower, Ben. \"'On My Own': The Top 10 Solo Shows on Broadway.\" \"Playbill\", PLAYBILL INC., 6 Sept. 2014, www.playbill.com/article/on-my-own-the-top-10-solo-shows-on-broadway-com-328659.\n\n\"History of Solo Performance.\" \"Allforone\", www.afo.nyc/history-of-solo-performance.\n\nCatron, Louis E. \"The power of one: the solo play for playwrights, actors, and directors\".

{"id": "1684824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1684824", "title": "Spectacle", "text": "Spectacle\n\nIn general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \"specially prepared or arranged display\" it was borrowed from Old French \"spectacle\", itself a reflection of the Latin \"spectaculum\" \"a show\" from \"spectare\" \"to view, watch\" frequentative form of \"specere\" \"to look at.\" The word \"spectacle\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama.\nCourt masques and masques of the nobility were most popular in the Jacobean and Caroline era. Such masques, as their name implies, relied heavily upon a non-verbal theater. The character lists for masques would be quite small, in keeping with the ability of a small family of patrons to act, but the costumes and theatrical effects would be lavish. Reading the text of masques, such as \"The Masque at Ludlow\" (most often referred to as \"Comus\"), the writing is spare, philosophical, and grandiose, with very few marks of traditional dramatic structure. This is partially due to the purpose of the masque being family entertainment and spectacle. Unlike \"The Masque at Ludlow\", most masques were recreations of well-known mythological or religious scenes. Some masques would derive from tableau. For example, Edmund Spenser (\"Fairie Queene\" I, iv) describes a masque of \"The Seven Deadly Sins\". \n\nMasques were multimedia, for they almost always involved costuming and music as a method of conveying the story or narrative. Ben Jonson, for example, wrote masques with the architect Inigo Jones. William Davenant, who would become one of the major impresarios of the English Restoration, also wrote pre-Revolutionary masques with Inigo Jones. The role of the architect was that of designer of the staging, which would be elaborate and often culminate in a fireworks show.\n\nWhen the zoetrope and nickelodeon technology first appeared, the earliest films were spectacles. They caught the attention of common people. They showed things people would rarely see, and they showed it to the wide audience.\n\nWithin industrial and post-industrial cultural and state formations, spectacle has been appropriated to describe appearances that are purported to be simultaneously enticing, deceptive, distracting and superficial. (Jonathan Crary: 2005) Current academic theories of spectacle \"highlight how the productive forces of marketing, often associated with media and Internet proliferation, create symbolic forms of practice that are emblematic of everyday situations\".\n\nSpectacle can also refer to a society that critics describe as dominated by electronic media, consumption, and surveillance, reducing citizens to spectators by political neutralization. Recently the word has been associated with the many ways in which a capitalist structure is purported to create play-like celebrations of its products and leisure time consumption. The work of French Marxist thinker Guy Debord is perhaps the best-known example of this critical analysis; see his \"The Society of the Spectacle\" (1967)\n\n\n"}

The goal of Stand-up tragedy is to make the audience members cry.\n\nStand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories. Stand-up tragedy is often performed in bars, nightclubs, private homes, art museums, galleries and universities.\n\nThe origin of the term Stand up tragedy is unknown. The comedian Brother Theodore (1906–2001) used the term to describe his comedic act which was dark, and had an absurdist edge. The Beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti (1919-) often refers to himself as a \"stand-up tragedian\",\n"}
{"id": "2886821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2886821", "title": "Sukisho", "text": "Sukisho\n\n, also known as Sukisho! or \"Sukisyo!\" is a light novel that has since expanded into a Boys' Love game (a type of Visual Novel), an anime series and OVA. The title translates into English as \"I like what I like, so it can't be helped\", or \"I like what I like, so there!\" The best known of the versions is the BL game, which features mild BL, and, in the original PC release, hardcore BL. The story is owned by SOFTPAL and Platinum Label, and the illustrations to the novels and games is by Tsutae Yuzu.\n\nHigh-school student Sora Hashiba was hospitalized after falling from the fourth floor of the school building. On his first night back in the dormitory, he wakes to find a strange boy addressing him by the name \"Yoru\". The stranger identifies himself as \"Ran\" and says he's Sora's new roommate. The next day, Sora's childhood friend and dorm manager, Matsuri Honjou, informs Sora that the other boy, whom Matsuri identifies as Sunao Fujimori or \"Nao-kun,\" is actually another childhood friend of Sora. Sora doesn't remember meeting Sunao before. In fact, Sora can't remember much of anything regarding his past, and the series follows his quest to regain his memory.\n\nSora soon learns why Sunao identified himself as \"Ran\" that first night: he and Sora have alternate personalities. Sora's is Yoru, a powerful protector and the lover of the more dependent, feminized Ran. The existence of these alternate personalities, and the relationship between them, has some mysterious connection with Sora's fall from the window and his forgotten past. The alternate personalities' passionate relationship is a far cry from the hostility and distrust between Sora and Sunao. Because Yoru and Ran possess them arbitrarily, Sora and Sunao frequently find themselves in embarrassing situations when they regain control of their minds.\n\nOther comical situations arise from Matsuri's efforts to draw Sora and Sunao into his moneymaking schemes, known as the group \"The School Do-It-Alls\" and from such minor characters as a bishōnen ghost and three younger boys who resemble the trio. No parents are ever mentioned, and the only authority figures are school nurse Kai Nanami and math teacher Shin-ichirou Minato, but it is known that Sora and Sunao are both orphans. Both have some connection with Sora and Sunao's dark past, which also involves one of the older students at the school, Kai Nagase, and a mysterious doctor named Aizawa.\n\nThe main character of \"Sukisho\". Sora can't remember his past and at first doesn't know he has an alternate personality named Yoru. Sora has spiky blue hair, blue eyes, and is usually easy going, and also loves to eat. As a dominant male, he has a complicated and occasionally hostile relationship with his roommate and former childhood friend Sunao Fujimori. Normally, he refers to Sunao by his last name, Fujimori. Sora also seems to be the character most often harmed in the anime. \nSora's alternate personality. Unlike Sora, Yoru is both shrewd and flirtatious. He is considered the seme of the couple. Yoru loves Ran, but he isn't above flirting with anyone. He loves Ran and will often show it when in bed with him (which embarrasses Sunao in the aftermath). However, Yoru will protect Sora when he feels a need. In the game, he also likes to joke around with Sora by placing images of Sora's friends in odd positions (including Sunao and Ran, Hiromu, Nanami, and oddly enough, Yoru himself). Yoru can be distinguished from Sora by his slightly darker hair, increased height, deeper voice and a glowing amber left eye. He is also usually seen with a long white piece of cloth tied to his right arm. In one of the drama CDs it is said that he tried to kill himself because he left Ran in the lab, and wears the white cloth as a memento. \nSunao is Sora's childhood friend and current roommate. Sunao has long pink hair usually tied with a long piece of red ribbon and pink eyes, and an alternate personality named Ran. Easily angered, he isn't above punching anyone who makes him lose his temper, especially Sora, who he punches a few times in the beginning of the anime series. At first, he claims he hates Sora, but he becomes closer to Sora with each game/episode, eventually consummating his relationship with Sora. Just as Sora calls Sunao by his last name, Sunao refers to Sora as Hashiba; in some episodes, Sunao calls Sora by the childhood nickname of \"Kuu-chan\" instead. \nJust as Sora has Yoru, Sunao also has an alternate personality, named Ran (蘭), which is Japanese for orchid. Ran is dependent, demanding and in some cases more feminine than Sunao. Ran is the uke of the pairing, and loves Yoru to the point of an obsession. He will occasionally flirt with Sora only to bring out Yoru. Ran can be distinguished from Sunao by his slightly brighter pink hair color (in the game), higher voice, and red eyes; in the anime, the red eyes are the only feature the two personalities don't share. Unlike Yoru, Ran never harasses Sunao, though he will attempt to seduce anyone else. Note that Kappei Yamaguchi is the voice actor for Ran in the Drama CD and games, but the same voice actor (Hoshi Souichirou) plays both Sunao and Ran the anime. \nA close childhood friend of both Sora and Sunao, Matsuri has long blond hair and green eyes. The dorm manager and head of the Do-It-All Club (in the anime), Matsuri always carries a camera, frequently taking fun (if embarrassing for Sora) snapshots. He's an upbeat person who likes to tease his friends, often inventing elaborate plans usually revolving around getting Sora and Sunao together, or making money. Sora and Sunao rarely like any of Matsuri's ideas, but the pair tends to go along with Matsuri despite that. Note that the Jack-of-All-Trades club that Matsuri establishes in the anime does not exist in the games. Also, he resembles Saotome Haruna from \"Mahou Sensei Negima\" in both image (Long hair with antennae) and \"Paru sama\" personality + Kazumi paparazzi.\nThe school nurse. Nanami is possibly the most feminine character in Sukisho (second most feminine would probably be Ran). The perfect housewife, Nanami cooks and cleans with a smile on his face. He lives with Shin-ichirou, whom he is in love with (they are seen sharing the same bed in the anime and the dramas show them to be married). He is very nice and easy to talk to, although he is constantly haunted with guilt because of his past where he worked with Aizawa conducting immoral experiments on humans in an effort to help Shin-ichiro with his own mental condition. There is hardly any difference between the games and the anime when concerning Nanami, but in the games he tends to be slightly more high strung (he can and WILL punch Shin-ichirou when he feels the need for it). Nanami has brown shoulder length hair (may be slightly longer) and blue eyes. \nThe school math teacher. He loves Nanami and cares very much for Sora and Sunao (who often refer to him as 'nii-chan'or \"brother\" though they are not blood related). Usually, Shin-ichirou is very easy going and somewhat immature, though caring. He will often flirt with Nanami, but most of the time in a playful way. He is, however, very prone to jealousy and he also has another side of him often referred to as 'Minato' or 'Minato-sensei'. As Minato, he is very flirtatious and will attempt to force people into sex (often Sora or Nanami). Usually, Nanami just has to mess up Minato's hair or punch him to bring back Shin-ichirou. In White Flower, Minato acts more evil and becomes Aizawa's slave after being brainwashed. Shin-ichirou has black spiky hair and blue eyes. As Minato, his hair is a lot more tidy and sometimes his eyes are pitch black. \nSora's friend, he is a year younger than Sora. He has a crush on Nagase Kai, manager of the Chemistry labs. He seems to be always happy, and he tries to help his friend any way he can. A sincere boy of pure feelings, Sora says that \"He expresses four times more his feelings than the majority of the people\". In the game \"Mou Matte\", Gaku is given the position of main character and must choose to either continue his relationship with Nagase (as the uke, or bottom) or start a new one with Shiina (as the seme, or top). \nHe is the chemistry lab manager. A quiet, serious and mysterious man, yet he is very intelligent and has gotten his thesis printed in numerous science magazines. Gaku is in love with him, admires him and is always praising him whenever he can. Nagase knows this, and takes advantage of this when needed. But finally, he changed because of Gaku's true love. He is the son of Professor Aizawa, the main antagonist. \n\nThree children who have become attached to Sora, Sunao, and the rest. It is unknown if Sei and Shiina have parents, but Kitamura has become Hano Yoshihiro's stepbrother (which he resents in the anime). Sei resembles Sora while Shiina resembles a young Nanami. Kitamura does not really resemble anyone, but fans have said he somewhat resembles Sunao due to his hot pink hair. After episode 3, they are never seen apart and seem to act identical for most of the series (except in episode 13, the OVA). In the games, their personalities are a lot more diverse and they are very similar Sora, Sunao, and Matsuri when they were in school. Sei acts the most immature of three (Sora), Kitamura comes up with various plans and likes to joke around (Matsuri), and Shiina tends to be the more effeminate tsundere (Sunao). They also live together in the same dorms. In the games and their teacher is Sora. Although not exactly related, Sei is sometimes seen as Sora and Sunao's child. In the games, Shiina also has a crush on Gaku and whether or not he ends up with Gaku depends on the player's choice (in both White Flower and Mou Matte). Kitamura can also end up with Gaku, but only in Mou Matte. In the game Sei is Sora's clone. He cannot speak first, but starts to trust Sunao and Sora after a while. After White Flower, the three of them are like a family. Ren (蓮) or (恋) means 'lotus' or 'romance, love' in Japanese. \n\nThe adopted child of Ayano. He is really shy and unexpressive, seems to be a chibi-Gaku as Sei-kun to Sora (chibi-Sora). The first time he smiled was when Ayano used his favourite plushie (a pink rabbit) to talk to him. Since then, Ayano always brings it with him. In the games and novels, Aizawa made Kano out of DNA from Gaku Ichikawa as he admired Gaku's cheerfulness. \n\nOccasionally appears in the game and makes brief appearances in the anime. Soushi is a lawyer who loves to flirt with Nanami. Most of the time, he playfully flirts with Nanami just to anger Shin-ichirou. Compared to most of the character, he acts a lot more refined, but he will occasionally get mad (especially if children are making too much noise). In the games, there are scenes where he and Sora have sex (depending on the choices the player makes). The PS2 game and the Drama CDs show that Soushi and Matsuri could become a couple. He is also the middle brother of Shin-ichirou Minato and Ryouya Kozuki. \n\nShin-ichirou's and Soushi's older brother. He has a psychiatric clinic and he does double-personalities-analysis to Sora and to Sunao (with Soushi's and Nanami's approval, though the same can not be said for Sora and Sunao). He brings always with him a pink rabbit and does ventriloquism with it to his adopted child, Kano-kun (seemingly a bit unexpressive and shy enough). Smiles often and loves children. In the games, he originally worked for Aizawa. \n\nA young boy who loves Sora (later on he loves Sunao in the game). He gets into an accident that puts him into the hospital. He then becomes a wandering spirit, but what he does differs between the anime and the games. In the anime, Hiromu haunts the halls of the school to find Sora. In the games, he possesses Sunao and tries to spend time with Sora (this is indicated by Sunao's sudden hair color change to white and the playful tune in the background). Hiromu acts very innocent and playful. Eventually, his spirit returns to his body. In First Limit, Sora can end up with Hiromu if the players makes the right choices. \n\nGaku Ichikawa's classmate, and is also close to Fuuta Kitamura. He is cheerful and enjoys chemistry, just like Gaku, and is the step brother of Fuuta Kitamura. In the games and novels, he has an obsession with putting pink bows in his hair. \n\nA character appearing only in the games and the OVA, he is a young boy who works at a nearby church and has a very close relationship with Sora Hashiba. In Target Nights, he became friends with Sora, but ended almost killing Sora and Sunao because he said that Sora was possessed. Later, it is revealed that Aizawa manipulated his feelings to get revenge on Nanami (who was Chris real target) to which Chris apologies. Chris also has a love interest in Nanami, the two where close friends when Nanami worked for Aizawa in the laboratory. On the next games, he became a recurring character and a real friend of Sora and his friends. \n\nAizawa is the main antagonist in Sukisho. He is a professor at the university which Sunao attends after the games, and the chemistry department advisor. Aizawa is obsessed with studying medicine and cloning and even invented medicine that can control the mind and emotions of human beings. Aizawa grew up with and became friends with Shin-ichirou Minato and Kai Nanami. Aizawa struggled with psychological issues, unable to function properly in public, and had issues handling his emotions. Aizawa had begun falling in love with Shin-ichirou Minato but failed to cope with such emotions. As he entered high school, he switched schools and Kai Nanami wound up working and studying under him by college so he can help Shin-ichirou with his schizophrenia but left after Aizawa attacked him. Aizawa became obsessed with causing Nanami pain and shortly after, kidnapped Sora Hashiba and Sunao Fujimori and had performed grotesque experiments on them when they were children. Aizawa has three \"sons\" whom are all clones by the names Nagase Kai, Cano, and Ren Shiina. Aizawa cannot also feel pain physically. Despite Aizawa being cold and collective, he is usually hyper and fun around Gaku Ichikawa and Nagase Kai. Aizawa deeply cares about the people around him, but due to his emotional disability, has issues showing so. Shin-ichirou's brother Ayano winds up working for him, claiming Aizawa was very depressed and lonely. Most of Aizawa's hate towards Nanami is mostly due to jealousy. By the end of the games, Aizawa redeems himself and happily works as a professor again, leaving the main characters alone. It's implied him and Ayano become a couple. \n\nOpening Theme: \"Just A Survivor\", performed by Tatsuhisa Suzuki. <BR>\nEnding Theme: \"Daydreamin'\", performed by Kishō Taniyama.\n\n\nCurrently, there are four games and one spin-off in the \"Sukisho\" series. The games were originally point-and-click visual novels released for PC, containing sexual content, though certain body parts are censored (as is all pornographic material in Japan).\n\nThree of the games have been released on the Sony PlayStation 2. The PS2 versions have been heavily edited and many new CG scenes have been added. In addition, they feature the voice acting from the Drama CD cast, which were absent in the PC release. These games do not yet have an official English translation.\n\nThe first game in the series. Sora Hashiba was put into the hospital for quite some time after falling from one of the school buildings. He didn't receive any major injuries, but he has lost some of his memories in the process. However, he continually sees a vision of him being carried through several dark corridors and the voice of someone calling out to him. After being released from the hospital, Sora heads back to the dorms to find that a new boy by the name of Sunao Fujimori, who will now be his roommate. He is told that Sunao is his childhood friend, but he cannot recall spending his childhood with Sunao. As he spends time with Sunao, he notices some strange things about him, including his transformation into his alternate personality Ran. On top of that, the spirit of a hospitalized schoolmate possesses Sunao and confesses his love for him. Depending on the player's decisions, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Hiromu, Ran, or Minato.\n\nAfter spending some time in Shin-ichirou and Nanami's place, Sora and Sunao come across a mysterious cosplaying bandit known only by the number 416. He claims that he has come to take away something precious from Sora. Meanwhile, Sora and Sunao meet Chris, who works at the nearby church. While he seems harmless, he begins to spend more time with Sora. To top it all off, Sora begins to realize that there are times when he and Sunao are mysteriously in bed together. He already knows about Sunao's connection with his alternate personality Ran, but could that mean he has his own alternate personality as well? Depending on the choices of the player, Sora will either end up with Sunao, Chris, Ran, Matsuri, or Minato. Also, obtaining all the CGs rewards the player with a special ending involving bandits 416, 773, and most recently 848.\n\nPossibly the turning point in the series. Sora and Sunao continue their life in school. All seems normal until Sora notices a child that looks very similar to himself. Also, some of his schoolmates are beginning to act a little strange. Even Sora begins to notice that something odd about his connection to Sunao and the relationship between their alternate personalities Yoru and Ran. Depending on the choices of the player, Sora may end up with Sunao, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. Collecting all the CGs allows the player to access secret endings that involve Sora, Sunao, Matsuri, Shin-ichirou, and Nanami banding together as cosplaying bandits 848, 370, 332, 416, and 773.\n\n\"Sukisho\" cast's status prior to \"White Flower\":\n\n\nThe final game in the series. Taking place a couple of years after \"Rain\", many changes have been made to the school. Not only is it no longer an all-boys school, several of the former students are now working as teachers while others move onto other jobs. Sora, as one of the teachers, has been living a fairly normal life as he takes Minato's place as teacher. However, he realizes that it won't stay normal for long when he sees that Sunao, who he has not seen since the events in \"Rain\", reappears in one of the halls. This game finally wraps up the story between Sora and Sunao and ends their conflict with Professor Aizawa. Depending on the player's choices, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Nanami, Hiromu, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. There are two hidden endings in this game. The Yoru/Ran ending is received when achieving the true ending, while the Kaito ending is obtained when all the CGs are collected.\n\nA spin off of the \"Sukisho\" games. Takes place some time in between \"Rain\" and \"White Flower\". The player now controls Gaku Ichikawa, one of Sora's friends who worked in the Chemistry Lab. Gaku must now choose whether to continue his relationship with Kai Nagase or start a new one with Ren Shiina. Depending on the player's choice, Gaku may end up with Shiina, Nagase, or Kitamura. Most of the main cast from the previous \"Sukisho\" games are visibly absent, including Sora and Sunao. Of the original cast, only Gaku, Nagase, Shiina, Kitamura, Nanami, Nakahara, and Hano make appearances.\n\n"}
{"id": "634116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634116", "title": "Super Sentai", "text": "Super Sentai\n\nThe is a Japanese superhero team metaseries of TV series produced by Toei Company, Toei Agency and Bandai, and aired by TV Asahi (\"Sentai\" is the Japanese word for \"task force\" or \"fighting squadron\"). The shows are of the \"tokusatsu\" genre, featuring live action characters and colorful special effects, and are aimed at children. \"Super Sentai\" airs alongside the \"Kamen Rider\" series in the \"Super Hero Time\" programming block on Sunday mornings. In North America, the Super Sentai Series is best known as the source material for the \"Power Rangers\" franchise.\nIn every Super Sentai Series, the protagonists are a team of people who – using wrist-worn or hand-held devices – transform into superheroes and gain superpowers – color-coded uniforms, signature weapons, sidearms, and fighting skills – to battle a group of evil beings that threaten to take over the Earth. In a typical episode, the heroes thwart the enemies' plans and defeat an army of enemy soldiers and the monster of the week before an enlarged version of the monster confronts them, only to be defeated again when the heroes fight it with their mecha. Each Super Sentai Series is set in its own fictional universe; various TV, video and film specials feature a team-up between one or more teams.\n\nThe series was created by Shotaro Ishinomori, then known for the 1971–1973 \"Kamen Rider\" TV series and the long-running manga \"Cyborg 009\". He developed the first two Super Sentai Series \"Himitsu Sentai Gorenger\", which ran from 1975 to 1977, and \"J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai\", released in 1977. Toei Company put the franchise on hiatus in 1978, collaborating with Marvel Comics to produce a live action \"Spider-Man\" series, which added giant robots to the concept of \"tokusatsu\" shows. The giant robot concept was carried over to Toei and Marvel's next show, \"Battle Fever J\", released in 1979, and was then used throughout the Super Sentai Series.\n\nIn 1993, American production company Saban Entertainment adapted 1992's \"Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger\" into \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" for the Fox Kids programming block, combining the original Japanese action footage with new footage featuring American actors for the story sequences. Since then, nearly every \"Super Sentai\" series that followed became a new season of \"Power Rangers\". Some countries, such as France, Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines, switched from broadcasting \"Super Sentai\" to \"Power Rangers\". In 2002, Saban sold the \"Power Rangers\" franchise to Disney's Buena Vista division, who owned it until 2010, broadcasting \"Power Rangers\" on ABC Kids, ABC Family Channel, Jetix, and Toon Disney. On 12 May 2010, Saban bought the franchise back from Disney, moving the show to the Nickelodeon network for 2011.

{"id": "38243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38243", "title": "Suspension of disbelief", "text": "Suspension of disbelief\n\nThe term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \"human interest and a semblance of truth\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe phrase \"suspension of disbelief\" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is cut in half or transforms into a gorilla in order to enjoy the performance.\n\nAccording to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. Black-and-white films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people (achromats), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.\n\nColeridge coined the phrase in his \"Biographia Literaria\", published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry. Chapter XIV describes the preparations with Wordsworth for their revolutionary collaboration \"Lyrical Ballads\" (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. Alexander Pope, notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in \"The Rape of the Lock\", one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of \"willing suspension of disbelief\" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.\n\nColeridge recalled:\n\nThe notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his \"Ars Poetica\" (with the quotation \"Ut pictura poesis\").\n\nSuspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by Shakespeare, who refers to it in the Prologue to \"Henry V\":\n\nPsychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation. When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, \"poetic faith\". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.\n\nOnly when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really \"into\" the fiction – \"transported\", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, \"disinterested\". We respond aesthetically, without purpose. We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.\n\nSuspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book \"Flux\". It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of OCD. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.\n\nAesthetic philosophers generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and \"fictions.\" Kendall Walton notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, \"Look behind you!\" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.\n\nHowever, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation \"...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith,\" of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.\n\nNot all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. J. R. R. Tolkien challenges this concept in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner consistency of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an internally consistent fictional world, the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33270508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33270508", "title": "Sword Art Online", "text": "Sword Art Online\n\nAn anime television series produced by A-1 Pictures, known simply as \"Sword Art Online\", aired in Japan between July and December 2012, with television film \"Sword Art Online: Extra Edition\" airing on December 31, 2013, and a second season, titled \"Sword Art Online II\", airing between July and December 2014. An animated film titled \"\" featuring an original story by Kawahara premiered in Japan and Southeast Asia on February 18, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 9, 2017. A spin-off anime series titled \"Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online\" premiered in April 2018, while a third season titled \"Sword Art Online: Alicization\" premiered on October 7, 2018. A live-action series will be produced by Netflix. Six video games based on the series have been released for multiple consoles.\n\n\"Sword Art Online\" has received widespread commercial success, with the light novels having over 20 million copies sold worldwide. The anime series has received mixed to positive reviews, praised for its animation, musical score, and exploration of the psychological aspects of virtual reality, but criticized for its pacing and writing.\n\nThe light novel series spans several virtual reality worlds, beginning with the titular world of \"Sword Art Online\". Each world is built on a game engine called the World Seed, which was initially developed specifically for \"SAO\" by Akihiko Kayaba, but was later duplicated for \"ALO\", and later willed to Kirito, who had it leaked online with the successful intention of reviving the virtual reality industry.\n\nIn 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game (VRMMORPG) called \"Sword Art Online\" (\"SAO\") is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba.\n\nOn November 6, 10,000 players log into the \"SAO\"s mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of \"SAO\", if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.\n\nOne of the players, named Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya, is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of \"beater\", a portmanteau of \"beta tester\" and \"cheater\". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna Yuuki, forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.\n\nIn the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 \"SAO\" players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Shouzou Yuuki, Asuna's father, who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another \"SAO\" survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on \"The World Tree\" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called \"Alfheim Online\" (\"ALO\"). Assisted in-game by his cousin Suguha \"Leafa\" Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from \"SAO\"), he quickly learns that the trapped players in \"ALO\" are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 \"SAO\" players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving \"ALO\" to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive.\n\nSoon after, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called \"Gun Gale Online\" (\"GGO\"), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named Shino \"Sinon\" Asada, he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in \"SAO\". Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes.\n\nKazuto is later recruited to assist in testing an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played to help develop an artificial intelligence for the Ministry of Defense (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride. The MOD recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that UnderWorld was created as part of an experiment to create artificial intelligence that could be used for military purposes.\n\nReki Kawahara wrote the first volume in 2002 as a competition entry for ASCII Media Works' , but refrained from submitting it as he had exceeded the page limit; he instead published it as a web novel under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori. Over time, he added three further episodes and several short stories. In 2008, he participated in the competition again by writing \"Accel World\", this time winning the Grand Prize. Aside from \"Accel World\", he was requested to get his earlier work, \"Sword Art Online\", published by ASCII Media Works. He agreed and withdrew his web novel versions.\n\nFor the character protagonist Kirito, Kawahara was asked if Kirito's personality and character were based on his own; he answered that he usually does not put aspects of himself into his characters, and jokingly remarked: \"but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming parties. We [both] tend to play solo in these games a lot.\" He also noted that the female characters in the story were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, stating: \"I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable.\" He added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, but rather decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. He noted that \"the character of Asuna I might have created a little too perfectly for \"Sword Art Online\"\".\n\nAfter Kawahara's request for \"Sword Art Online\" to be published was approved, he started working with illustrator abec on the light novel series. The first volume was published in print on April 10, 2009, and 20 volumes have been published as of September 8, 2017.

The Alicization story arc was covered by volumes 9 through 18, while volumes 19 and 20 told a side story called Moon Cradle. Kawahara plans on writing \"one more big arc\" called \"Sword Art Online: Unital Ring\" that will go \"back to the real world.\" The Unital Ring story arc will begin in volume 21, which is scheduled to be released in Japan on December 7, 2018.\n\nKawahara also writes the \"Sword Art Online: Progressive\" series, which covers Kirito's adventures on the first few floors of Aincrad.

An original 100-page prequel novel to \"\" written by Kawahara, titled \"Hopeful Chant\", was released to people who watched the film in Japan during March 4–10, 2017.\n\nAt their Japan Expo USA panel, Yen Press announced the rights to publish the light novels; the first volume was released on April 22, 2014. Yen Press later announced their license of the \"Sword Art Online: Progressive\" series, which is scheduled for release in 2015. The novels are also published in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, with future plans for publications in France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and others.\n\nThere are a number of \"dōjinshi\" (fan works) written by Kawahara under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori, titled .

Laeta Kalogridis has been attached to write a script for the pilot, and will also serve as executive producer for the series alongside Skydance CEO David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Marcy Ross. Skydance has stated their intent to \"fast-track\" the launch of the series, along with plans to follow the TV series with the release of a \"Sword Art Online\" virtual reality experience. In February 2018, it was reported that the live-action series had been sold to Netflix.\n\nAccording to Oricon, \"Sword Art Online\" was the top selling light novel series of 2012, with eight volumes figuring among the top selling light novels. It was ranked first in the 2012 and 2013 \"Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!\" rankings, as well as top ten placement in 2011, 2014 and 2015. It was also the second best selling light novel series for the first half of 2016 in Japan, selling 489,374 copies. \"Sword Art Online: Progressive\" sold 321,535 copies in the same time period. As of 2017, the series has an estimated 20 million copies in print worldwide.\n\nRichard Eisenbeis of Kotaku hails \"Sword Art Online\" as the smartest series in recent years, praising its deep insight on the psychological aspects of virtual reality on the human psyche, its sociological views on creating a realistic economy and society in a massively multiplayer online game setting, and the writing staff's ability to juggle a wide variety of genres within the series. Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing \"definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world.\" However, at the time of this preliminary review, he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series. He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied on the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was \"reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for.\" Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, \"Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are.\"\n\nRebecca Silverman of Anime News Network has criticized the series as having pacing problems, logical gaps, and \"sloppy writing\". Theron Martin of Anime News Network criticized the story as struggling \"to achieve and maintain the level of gravitas that life-or-death danger should have\", while calling it unwilling to commit to Kirito's \"lone wolf\" image. DeviceCritique explains that \"Sword Art Online\" influences the virtual reality market to grow, and references the Oculus Rift as a prime example of the starting point of virtual reality. It also praises \"Sword Art Online\" for exploring the psychological and social aspects of virtual reality gaming. Adam Facey of \"The Muse,\" criticized the series as being sexist and the female characters as being overly sexualized.\n\nKirito has a cameo appearance in episode 8 of the anime series \"Eromanga Sensei\", with Yoshitsugu Matsuoka reprising his role.\n\nSteven Spielberg's 2018 film \"Ready Player One\" contains a reference to \"Sword Art Online\". Ernest Cline, the writer of 2011 novel \"Ready Player One\", discussed \"Sword Art Online\" in an interview, noting how he met its writer Reki Kawahara at an event in Japan where they discussed how they independently developed similar ideas related to virtual reality.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed \"Sword Art Online II\" among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.\n\nIn September 2018, AbemaTV hosted an election for \"Sword Art Online\". The character that received the most retweets would be crowned the winner and become the focus of a smartphone wallpaper. According to the poll, Yuuki Konno had the most votes, with 2,243 points, followed by Shino Asada with 2,145 points and Asuna Yuuki with 1,345 points.\n\n"}
{"id": "20303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20303", "title": "The Muppets", "text": "The Muppets\n\nThe Muppets are an ensemble cast of puppet characters known for their self-aware, burlesque, and meta-referential style of variety-sketch comedy. Created by Jim and Jane Henson in 1955, they are the namesake for the Disney media franchise that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.\n\nThe Muppets originated in the short-form television series \"Sam and Friends\", which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. The Muppets attained celebrity status and international recognition through their breakout roles in \"The Muppet Show\" (1976–1981), a primetime television series that garnered four Primetime Emmy Award wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run. \n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical feature films, including \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979); \"The Great Muppet Caper\" (1981); and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell the Jim Henson Company. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with television series \"The Jim Henson Hour\" (1989) and \"Muppets Tonight\" (1996–98), both of which were similar in format to \"The Muppet Show\", and three films: \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" (1992), \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996), and \"Muppets from Space\" (1999). \n\nDisney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years. Under Disney, the Muppets achieved revitalized success, starring in two films - \"The Muppets\" (2011) and \"Muppets Most Wanted\" (2014) - as well as a short-lived primetime television series on ABC and a reboot of the \"Muppet Babies\" animated series.\n\nThroughout their six-decade career, the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and popular culture in the United States, receiving recognition from various cultural institutions and organizations, including the American Film Institute, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Library of Congress, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe Muppets were created by puppeteer Jim Henson in the 1950s, beginning with Kermit the Frog, who would become Henson's most recognizable character. Originally conceived for an adult audience, Henson claimed, and later retracted, that he coined the term \"Muppet\" as a portmanteau of the words \"marionette\" and \"puppet\". In 1955, the Muppets were introduced in \"Sam and Friends\", a short-form television series produced for WRC-TV in Washington D.C. Developed by Henson and eventual wife Jane Nebel, the series was notable for being the first form of puppet media not to incorporate a physical proscenium arch within which the characters are presented, relying instead on the natural framing of the television set through which the program was viewed.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the characters—in particular, Kermit and Rowlf the Dog—appeared in skits on several late-night talk shows and on television commercials, including \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" Rowlf became the first Muppet character with a regular spot on network television when he began appearing alongside Jimmy Dean on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\". In 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett began developing an educational television program targeted towards children and approached Henson to design several Muppet characters for the program. Produced by the Children's Television Workshop, the program debuted as \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. \n\nHenson and his creative team performed and created several characters for \"Sesame Street\" during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. \"Sesame Street\" received critical acclaim, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was touted to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for the series' educational curriculum.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in \"The Land of Gorch\" segments during the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". As his involvement with \"Sesame Street\" continued, Henson mused about the possibility of creating a network television series featuring the Muppets; as opposed to \"Sesame Street\", however, this proposed series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on sketch comedy. Two pilot specials, \"The Muppets Valentine Show\" and \"\", aired on ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively. \n\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and no other major American network expressed interest in backing the project, British producer Lew Grade approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for Associated Television. Debuting in 1976, \"The Muppet Show\" introduced characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and Animal, in addition to showcasing regulars Kermit and Rowlf. Through its syndication, \"The Muppet Show\" became increasingly popular due to its sketch-variety format, unique brand of humor, and prolific roster of guest stars. The series went on to receive twenty-one Primetime Emmy Award nominations during its run and won four, including Outstanding Variety Series in 1978. The success of \"The Muppet Show\" allowed Henson Associates to diversify into theatrical films centered on the Muppets; the first of these, \"The Muppet Movie\", was released in 1979.\n\nFollowing \"The Muppet Movie\" were \"The Great Muppet Caper\" and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four Academy Award nominations. In 1983, Henson debuted another television series, \"Fraggle Rock\", which ran on HBO in the United States until 1987.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Henson entered discussions with Michael Eisner and The Walt Disney Company, in which the latter would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets. Disney expressed interest in purchasing the company for $150 million. In addition to the company and Muppet characters, Eisner expressed a desire to include the \"Sesame Street\" characters as part of the acquisition. Henson declined the proposal, consistently referring to such a motive as a \"non-starter\" for the deal. As discussions between the two companies continued, Henson and Walt Disney Imagineering preemptively began developing Muppet-themed attractions for the Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World. \n\nHowever, the proposed merger was canceled after Henson's death in 1990. Nevertheless, Disney entered into a licensing agreement with Jim Henson Productions to use the characters in the theme parks. The following year, Muppet*Vision 3D debuted at Disney-MGM Studios, the only attraction to be successfully developed from the original Imagineering plans. Retaining interest in the franchise, Disney co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppet films, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" and \"Muppet Treasure Island\", with Henson in 1992 and 1996, respectively. Following those films, the characters starred in \"Muppets Tonight\", which ran on ABC and later on Disney Channel from 1996 to 1998; and a sixth film, \"Muppets from Space\", released by Columbia Pictures in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Henson was sold to EM.TV & Merchandising AG for $680 million. However, EM.TV was plagued with financial problems and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003, with the exception of the rights to the \"Sesame Street\" characters, which had been sold by EM.TV to Sesame Workshop.\n\nFourteen years after initial negotiations began, Disney acquired the Muppets intellectual property from the Jim Henson Company for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquisition consisted of the Muppets and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" properties, as well as the Muppets film and television library. Exceptions included the \"Sesame Street\" characters, which were previously sold to Sesame Workshop; the \"Fraggle Rock\" characters, which were retained by Henson; and the distribution rights to \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", \"Muppets from Space\", and \"Kermit's Swamp Years,\" which were retained by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Following the acquisition, Disney formed The Muppets Holding Company (later known as The Muppets Studio), a wholly owned subsidiary responsible for managing the characters and franchise. As a result, the term \"Muppet\" became a legal trademark of Disney; under license from Disney, Sesame Workshop continues to use the term for their characters, as well archival footage of Kermit the Frog.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company retains the rights to several productions featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\"; \"The Christmas Toy\"; \"\"; \"Henson's Place\"; \"Billy Bunny's Animal Songs\"; the original \"Dog City\" special; and \"Donna's Day\". While some of these have since been released uncut, most current releases of \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Toy\" omit the appearances by Kermit the Frog.\n\nDisney began gradually reintroducing the franchise to the mainstream in 2008. As a method of regaining a wider audience, Disney began to produce and release a series of comedy shorts on YouTube. After the Muppets' cover version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was posted on the Muppet Studio's YouTube channel, it ultimately amassed 50 million views and won two Webby Awards. Videos are posted on the site regularly. In 2010, the Muppets starred in \"The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora\", which co-starred Cat Cora and showcased cooking demonstrations. A television special, \"\", premiered on NBC on December 17, 2008; and was released on DVD on September 29, 2009. \n\nIn 2010, Disney used the Muppets to promote their volunteerism program at the company's theme parks. A Halloween special featuring the Muppets was developed during that time and expected to air on ABC that October, but was canceled.\n\nIn 2011, the Muppets were featured in an eponymous seventh film, intended to serve as a \"creative reboot\" for the characters. Disney had been furthering development on a Muppets film since 2008 when it considered adapting an unused screenplay by Jerry Juhl. Directed by James Bobin; written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller; and starring Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones, the film was met with widespread critical acclaim, commercial success, and an Academy Award win for Best Original Song. During the film's publicity campaign, the Muppets appeared in promotional advertisements and in effusive marketing efforts by Disney and were also featured in a promotional video for Google+. In March 2012, the Muppets received a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That year, the Muppets hosted a \"Just for Laughs\" comedy gala in Montreal.\n\nAfter the successful performance of \"The Muppets\", Disney announced an eighth film in March 2012, with Bobin and Stoller returning to direct and write, respectively. \"Muppets Most Wanted\" was released in 2014, and starred Ricky Gervais; Tina Fey; and Ty Burrell.\n\nDisney Theatrical Productions revealed in 2013 that a live show based on the Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to see how the technical components would work. \"Muppet Moments\", an interstitial television series, premiered on Disney Junior in April 2015. The short-form series features conversations between the Muppets and young children.\n\nAfter the release of \"Muppets Most Wanted\", Disney was interested in expanding the Muppets' presence across various media platforms, particularly in television. Discussions for a new primetime series began internally within the Muppets Studio. By April 2015, Bill Prady was commissioned to write a script for a pilot with the working title, \"Muppets 2015\". In May 2015, ABC announced that it had greenlit a new primetime television series titled \"The Muppets\", co-developed by Prady and Bob Kushell and directed by Randall Einhorn. The series premiered on September 22, 2015 in the United States, and ended on March 1, 2016. In 2017, the Muppets performed a series of live shows from September 8-10 at the Hollywood Bowl, hosted by Bobby Moynihan. A web television series featuring the Muppets is in development as of February 2018, tentatively scheduled to debut alongside the Disney+ streaming service in 2019. In July 2018, the cast performed a series of live shows at London's O2 Arena, their first outside of the United States.\n\nNotable Muppet characters of \"The Muppet Show\" and subsequent media include Kermit the Frog; Miss Piggy; Fozzie Bear; Gonzo; Rowlf the Dog; Scooter; Rizzo the Rat; Pepe the King Prawn; Dr. Bunsen Honeydew; Beaker; Statler and Waldorf; the Swedish Chef; Sam Eagle; Walter; and the Electric Mayhem, consisting of Dr. Teeth on keyboard, Animal on drums, Floyd Pepper on bass, Janice on lead guitar, Zoot on saxophone, and occasionally Lips on trumpet.\n\nAs well as \"The Muppet Show\", Muppet characters feature in such television series as \"The Jimmy Dean Show\", \"Sesame Street\", \"Fraggle Rock\", \"The Jim Henson Hour\", \"Muppets Tonight\", \"Bear in the Big Blue House\", \"\", and \"The Muppets\". An adult-oriented Muppet segment, \"The Land of Gorch\", was a regular feature in the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". Guest stars on \"Saturday Night Live\" occasionally include both the Muppets and \"Sesame Street\" characters, as well as Muppet likenesses of real people; these likenesses appear recurrently in early episodes of \"The Muppet Show\" and on \"Sesame Street\", and appear occasionally on other series such as \"30 Rock\".\n\nFollowing Disney's acquisition of the Muppets, puppets created by The Jim Henson Company are no longer referred to as Muppets. Puppets created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, such as those in \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\", have never been considered Muppets, as they are generally more complex in design and performance than regular Muppets. The \"Star Wars\" character Yoda was originally performed by Frank Oz, one of Henson's regular performers, and is often described as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, and Henson was not involved in the character's conception.\n\nAt the start of the Muppets' formation, Jim and Jane Henson were the group's only performers. In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with Frank Oz that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested Jerry Juhl, who worked alongside Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in Oakland, California. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time \"The Muppet Show\" began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; Dave Goelz; Jerry Nelson; Richard Hunt; and later, Steve Whitmire, while Juhl became head writer for the series. From \"The Muppet Show\" onward, Kevin Clash; Kathryn Mullen; Louise Gold; Karen Prell; Caroll Spinney; and Brian Henson performed several minor characters and often assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across \"The Muppet Show,\" \"Sesame Street\", \"Fraggle Rock\", and other Henson-related projects.\n\nHenson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire; Goelz; and Bill Barretta, who joined the main cast of performers in the 1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until David Rudman began performing those characters in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; Eric Jacobson assumed his characters beginning in 2002. At Nelson's behest, Matt Vogel gradually began performing his characters in 2008. \n\nWhitmire was dismissed from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and the majority of Whitmire's characters assumed by the remainder of the cast. The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and Peter Linz.\n\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as hand puppets, with several characters utilizing rods. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. The puppets are often molded or carved out of various types of foam, and then covered with any felt-like material. Muppets may represent humans; anthropomorphic characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial creatures; mythical beings; or other newly-conceived creatures, monsters, or abstract characters.\n\nThe Muppets are distinguished from ventriloquist dummies, which are often animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. Muppets are also generally made of softer materials. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not visible—hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame as the \"stage\" was an innovation of the Muppets. Previously on television, there would usually be a stage hiding the performers, as if in a live presentation. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; this is achieved by using invisible strings to manipulate the characters, with vocals added at a later point.\n\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted Puppet Heap to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets. The puppeteer, referred to as the \"Muppet performer\", holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or - in the case of \"live-hand\" Muppets - wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with their left hand. \n\nIn the case of more complex Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote manipulators, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to perform such complex movements as riding bicycles, rowing boats, and dancing wholly independently of the performer.\n\nAccording to writer Michael Davis, the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking time, often up to a year, slowly developing their characters and voices. The characters are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\". When interacting with them, children tended to act as though the Muppets were living creatures, even when they could see the puppeteers.\n\nOn September 17, 2002, Rhino Records released \"\", a compilation album of music from \"The Muppet Show\" and subsequent film outings. The Muppets also released \"\", with John Denver in 1979.\n\nUnder Disney ownership, albums featuring the Muppets have been released by Walt Disney Records, including \"Best of the Muppets: The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\" (2005), \"\" (2006), \"\" (2011), \"The Muppets: Original Soundtrack\" (2011), and \"Muppets Most Wanted: Original Soundtrack\" (2014). Legal music publishing rights to Muppet-related songs such as \"Rainbow Connection\", are controlled by Fuzzy Muppet Songs and Mad Muppet Melodies, imprints of Disney Music Publishing.\n\nThe Muppets appear at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, having first made appearances at Walt Disney World in 1990. Their first featured attraction, \"Here Comes the Muppets\", was a live stage show that opened shortly after Jim Henson's death and ran at Disney's Hollywood Studios (known then as Disney-MGM Studios) for a year. Muppet*Vision 3D, a 4D film attraction that uses audio-animatronic Muppets and 4D effects, then opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991. The attraction is notable for being the final Muppets project to be produced by Jim Henson. Muppet*Vision 3D had a subsequent opening at Disney California Adventure, on February 8, 2001, and operated there until its closure in 2014.\n\nIn addition to their main presence at Disney's Hollywood Studios, the Muppets also appear in \"Great Moments in American History\", a live show at the Magic Kingdom and the Muppet Mobile Lab at Epcot. The latter attraction is a free-roving vehicle with audio-animatronics of Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. As part of Disney's Living Character Initiative, it premiered in 2007 at Epcot and was later previewed at Disney California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIn 2010, the Muppets were the face of the \"Give a Day, Get a Disney Day\" charity campaign. Guests could register for a select service activity on the Disney website, and in return for completing the service work, participants could print a voucher for a free one-day admission ticket to Disneyland or Walt Disney World Resort. The Muppets appeared in television and print ads for the campaign and were featured prominently on the campaign's website.\n\nDisney has released numerous collector pins featuring the Muppets since 2004. These include Limited Edition pins, Hidden Mickey pin collections, mystery pin sets, 2008 pin sets promoting \"The Muppets\", cast lanyard pins, and assorted individual rack pins. Over 100 pins displaying the characters have been released overall.\n\nSince the late 1970s, numerous Muppet-related comic books have been released over the years. The first comic strips based on the Muppets appeared on September 21, 1981, in over 500 daily newspapers, just months after \"The Muppet Show\" ended its five-year run. \"The Muppets Comic Strip\" was printed daily from 1981 to 1986. By the end of its initial run, the comic strip was seen in over 660 newspapers worldwide. Special strips were also created in color, exclusively for issues of \"Muppet Magazine\".\n\nThe only film in the franchise to see a comic book adaptation was \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\". The comic book series was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in \"Marvel Super Special\" No. 32, August. The adaptation was later re-printed into three limited series issues, released under Marvel's Star Comics imprint (November 1984 – January 1985).\n\nIn the wake of the success of the \"Muppet Babies\" television show, Star Comics began releasing the \"Muppet Babies\" comic book title on a bi-monthly basis. These were original stories, not adaptations of the show's episodes. In the final \"Disney Adventures\" issue, with a cover date of November 2007, a one-page story single strip focusing on Fozzie Bear, Smedley, Statler, and Waldorf (with a cameo by Scooter) was released. Roger Langridge wrote and drew the comics intending it to be more long running.\n\nIn 2009, Boom! Studios began publishing \"The Muppet Show\", a mini-series based on the eponymous television show and written and drawn by Roger Langridge. An ongoing series titled \"The Muppet Show: The Comic Book\" followed and ran for eleven issues. Additionally, Boom! Studios also published Muppet fairy-tale comic adaptations similar to \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" and \"Muppet Treasure Island\". In 2012, Marvel Comics took over the publishing duties for the series.\n\nA comic strip by Guy Gilchrist and Brad Gilchrist circulated in newspapers during the 1980s. Many of the strips were compiled in various book collections.\n\n\"Muppet Magazine\" was published from 1983 to 1989. The magazine took on the format of being by the Muppets more than about them and had such features as celebrity interviews and comic stories.\n\nThe popularity of the Muppets has been so pervasive that the characters have been viewed by the media as celebrities in their own right. The Muppets have received their own collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Kermit having his own individual star as well. The characters have also presented at the Academy Awards and Emmy Awards; made cameo appearances in such feature films as \"Rocky III\", \"An American Werewolf in London\" and \"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\"; and have been interviewed on the news magazine \"60 Minutes\". \n\nKermit was interviewed early on in Jon Stewart's run on \"The Daily Show\", guest hosted \"The Tonight Show\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"\", \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" and an April Fools' Day edition of \"Larry King Live\"; and has served as Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. The characters also appeared in-character on such sitcoms and dramas as \"The Cosby Show\", \"The West Wing,\" and \"The Torkelsons\". The music video for the Weezer song \"Keep Fishin'\" is premised on the band performing on \"The Muppet Show\" and features appearances by several characters. \n\nOn September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a \"Jim Henson and the Muppets\" postage stamp series. The Muppets also appeared on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" for the 2008 countdown on December 31, 2007. Kermit, Rizzo, and others welcomed in the new year with a series of messages to welcome viewers back from the advertising breaks. After one such segment, with Kermit in Times Square, co-host Ryan Seacrest thanked his pal \"Kerms\" for the help bringing in '08. Miss Piggy has appeared as a guest on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" and Kermit appeared on \"Hollywood Squares\" and as one of the celebrity commentators on VH1's \"I Love\" documentary series. Kermit and the Muppets (and also Bear from \"Bear in the Big Blue House\") have also made many appearances on \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\".\n\nOn July 25, 2007, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta announced the opening of a new Jim Henson Wing, which would house anywhere from 500 to 700 retired Muppets. The new wing, first set to open in 2012 with films, sketches, and other materials from the Jim Henson Company archives, eventually opened as a gallery within the \"Worlds of Puppetry\" exhibition at the Center in November 2015.\n\nMuppet-like and Muppet-inspired puppets star in the 2004 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical \"Avenue Q\". Peter Jackson's film, \"Meet the Feebles\" is another parody of the Muppets. A vomit-spewing Kermit the Frog was a recurring character on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", and the Muppets were frequently preempted at the beginning of episodes for the Canadian series \"You Can't Do That on Television.\" Seth Green's short-lived show \"Greg the Bunny\" was about sentient hand-puppets working in a Muppet-like children's show. Many other films and television shows such as \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\", \"The West Wing\" and \"Robot Chicken\" have referenced The Muppets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "903896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=903896", "title": "Theatrical style", "text": "Theatrical style\n\nThere are four basic theatrical forms either defined, implied, or derived by or from Aristotle: Tragedy; Comedy; Melodrama; and Drama. Any number of styles can be used to convey these forms.\n\nA good working definition of, \"Style\", is \"how\" something is done. Theatrical styles are influenced by their time and place, artistic and other social structures, as well as the individual style of the particular artist or artists. As theater is a mongrel art form, a production may or may not have stylistic integrity with regard to script, acting, direction, design, music, and venue.\n\nThere are a variety of theatrical styles used in theater/drama. These include\n\nNaturalism\nPortraying life on stage with a close attention to detail, based on observation of real life. Cause and effect are central to the script's structure, with the subjects focused on conflicts of \"nature vs. nurture\", the natural order of things, survival, notions of evolution. The production style is one of everyday reality. \n\nRealism\nPortraying characters on stage that are close to real life, with realistic settings and staging. Realism is an effort to satisfy all the theatrical conventions necessary to the production, but to do so in a way that seems to be \"normal\" life.\n\nExpressionism\nAnti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lying within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an eternal truth or internal emotional conflict.\n\nAbsurdity\nPresents a perspective that all human attempts at significance are illogical. Ultimate truth is chaos with little certainty. There is no necessity that need drive us.\n\nEpic Theatre\nAs devised by Bertolt Brecht, epic theatre forces audience members to constantly return to rational observation, rather than emotional immersion. Sudden bursts of song, elements of absurdity and breaches of the fourth wall are all prime examples of how this rational observation is constantly revitalized; this idea is known as Verfremdungseffekt.\n\nMelodrama\nAs devised by early Greek dramatists, these styles rely on stock characters and stereotypes to portray stories in an exaggerated way, either tragic or comic. Links to commedia dell'arte.\n\nTheatre of Cruelty\nAs developed by Antonin Artaud, a style that encourages the shock and horror of the audience, through the excessive use of light and sound, instead of active entertainment or emotional relaxation.\n\nPhysical theatre\nA modernist approach to theatre which centralises a performer's movement as the key communicator of a play's storytelling. \n\nPoor theatre\nDeveloped by Jerzy Growotski, this genre believes in the stripping back of set, props, costume, light and sound to allow focus to be placed solely upon the actors, their characterisation and the underlying human relationships.\n\nImmersive theatre\nDeveloped by Augusto Boal, these styles all place focus on the audience member's individuality: their personal decisions, opinions and emotions, and how that impacts those of the characters onstage. The audience firmly exists within the 'world of the play'. Links to Promenade and Forum theatre.\n"}

Toy balloons are usually made of rubber or aluminized plastic, and inflated with air or helium. They come in a great variety of sizes and shapes, but are most commonly 10 to 30 centimetres in diameter. Toy balloons are not considered to include \"sky lanterns\" (hot-air paper balloons), although these too are or were used as child toys in some parts of the world.\n\nAccording to The Journal of the American Medical Association, out of 373 children who died in the US between 1972 and 1992 after choking on children's products, nearly a third choked on latex balloons. The Consumer Products Safety Commission found that children had inhaled latex balloons whole (often while trying to inflate them) or choked on fragments of broken balloons. \"Parents\", a monthly magazine about raising children, advised parents to buy Mylar balloons instead of latex balloons.\n\nEarly balloons were made from pig bladders and animal intestines. The Aztecs created the first balloon sculptures using cat intestines, which were then presented to the gods as a sacrifice. There are references to balloons made of whale intestine in \"Swiss Family Robinson\" (1813) and in \"Moby Dick\" (1851).\n\nThe first rubber balloons were made by Professor Michael Faraday in 1824 for use in his experiments with hydrogen at the Royal Institution in London. \"The caoutchouc is exceedingly elastic\", he wrote in the Quarterly Journal of Science the same year. \"Bags made of it...have been expanded by having air forced into them, until the caoutchouc was quite transparent, and when expanded by hydrogen they were so light as to form balloons with considerable ascending power...\" Faraday made his balloons by cutting round two sheets of rubber laid together and pressing the edges together. The tacky rubber welded automatically, and the inside of the balloon was rubbed with flour to prevent the opposing surfaces joining together.\n\nLatex rubber toy balloons were introduced by pioneer rubber manufacturer Thomas Hancock the following year in the form of a do-it-yourself kit consisting of a bottle of rubber solution and a condensing syringe. Vulcanized toy balloons, which unlike the earlier kind were unaffected by changes in temperature, were first manufactured by J.G. Ingram of London in 1847 and can be regarded as the prototype of modern toy balloons.\n\nIn the 1920s Neil Tillotson designed and produced a latex balloon with a cat's face and ears from a cardboard form which he cut by hand with a pair of scissors. He managed to make his first sale of these balloons with an order of 15 gross to be delivered for the annual Patriots Day Parade on April 19, 1931. The first colored balloons were sold at the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nInflatable foil balloons are made from plastics, such as aluminized PET film. Foil balloons are not elastic like rubber balloons, so that detailed and colorful pictures printed on their surfaces are not distorted when the balloon is inflated. Foil balloons are thus named because they sometimes have a metallic coating to make them shiny, however there have been concerns about metallic balloons causing short circuits when caught in overhead power lines. Because metallic balloons can cause power outages like on overhead catenary train lines , it is recommended that the metallic balloons not only be tied by a string or ribbon with no metal in it, but also securely tied down by a weight to prevent the balloon from floating away and some train operators either issue advisories on how to handle balloons or ban balloons altogether. When no longer required, it is recommended to cut the balloon to release the helium and dispose of in a garbage container.\n\nEvery toy balloon has an opening (or \"mouth\") through which gases are blown into it, followed by a connecting tube known as the \"neck\". Balloons are usually filled by using one's breath, a pump, or a pressurized gas tank. The opening can then be permanently tied off or clamped temporarily. Foil balloons are typically self-sealing. By filling a balloon with a gas lighter than air, such as helium, the balloon can be made to float. Helium is the preferred gas for floating balloons, because it is inert and will not catch fire (like hydrogen) or cause toxic effects when inhaled. Small, light objects (postcards, in balloon mail for example) are sometimes placed in balloons along with helium and released into the air and, when the balloon eventually falls, the object inside might be found by another person. Rubber balloons can also be filled with liquids (usually water) and can burst when they impact a solid object. Liquid-filled balloons are commonly referred to as water balloons or water bombs and used in playful fights, and sometimes vandalism.\n\nMost toy balloons are a simple oval-like shape. But balloon suppliers also offers other shapes for toy balloons. Some examples of other shapes are: \"zeppelins\" or \"airships,\" where balloons are usually longer than wide; \"espirals\" or \"rattlesnakes,\" similar to zeppelins, but much longer (not to be confused with balloons for twisting); \"hearts,\" balloons with the shape of a heart; \"dolls,\" two round shapes joined that represent a head and a body; \"mouseheads,\" composed of three round parts, one for the head and two for the ears; \"bunnyheads,\" similar to mouseheads but with long ears; \"bunny balloons,\" which resemble a stuffed toy bunny, having a big long shape for the body, a smaller shape for the head, and two long shapes for the ears; \"elephants,\" with two shapes for the body and the head, and a very long shape for the trunk; and \"ducks,\" with a big shape for the body, a smaller round shape for the head and smaller shape for the beak. There are many other possible shapes, depending on the manufacturers.\n\nThere are balloons that are longer and more cylindrical. These long balloons are often twisted and bent into simple, or intricate shapes which will hold their form when released. Balloon artists are people who quickly twist balloons into familiar or abstract shapes using the techniques of balloon modelling, usually for profit. Other names for balloon modeling include: balloon twisting, balloon bending, or simply twisting. \n\nArtists who practice balloon modeling are called: Balloon Twisters, Balloon Benders, Balloon Modeler and even have been referred to as a Latex Vessel Reconstruction Engineer.\n\nThe types of balloons used for this practice are pencil balloons and are called 160s, 260s, 350s, 360s, 660s or 646s. These number designations refer to the sizes of the balloons and roughly equate to the diameter and the length of the balloon when fully inflated. The 260, one of the most common animal balloon sizes, would be 2 inches in diameter and then 60 inches long when fully inflated. \n\nThe modeling balloons can be made into simple dogs, hearts, and swords or can be made into more intricate shapes such as dragons, cartoon characters, or even figments of the imaginations. More and more nearly anything is becoming possible with balloon twisting and it shows at major industry conventions such as Twist and Shout, the largest balloon twisting convention in the world.\n\nToy balloons are often characterized with its distinctive noises if manipulated in some ways. These noises include:\n\n\n\n\n\nToy balloons are used as decorations and/or advertising space. Balloons are usually purchased in deflated form, however, some party stores and vendors at special events will fill their balloons before selling them, this is called \"balloon stuffing\" where the balloons are filled with objects such as smaller balloons, teddy bears, etc.\n\nWhile toy balloons are primarily a toy, they are also sometimes used for demonstrations and experiments in classrooms. During the 19th century, it was thought that rubber balloons could be used to replace certain organs, but this was quickly disproved.\n\nToy balloons can be filled with water and used in a variety of ways, usually for fun. They can be thrown, or set up to drop on the head of an unsuspecting victim. Some Australians report using water balloons around their house during bushfires, as the heat of the flames breaks the balloon and causes the water to land on the fire.\n\nThere are water balloons which are balloons specifically designed to be filled with water.\n\n"}

{"id": "19810565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19810565", "title": "Whitehall farce", "text": "Whitehall farce\n\nThe Whitehall farces were a series of five long-running comic stage plays at the Whitehall Theatre in London, presented by the actor-manager Brian Rix, in the 1950s and 1960s. They were in the low comedy tradition of British farce, following the Aldwych farces, which played at the Aldwych Theatre between 1924 and 1933.\n\nThe five farces were as follows:\nRix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows. They included Leo Franklyn, Larry Noble, Dennis Ramsden and Derek Royle, and members of Rix's family: his wife, Elspet Gray, his sister, Sheila Mercier and his brother-in-law, Peter Mercier. Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include Terry Scott and Andrew Sachs. Rix starred in all five plays, in a range of roles: a \"gormless recruit\" to the army in \"Reluctant Heroes\"; a timidly crooked bookie's runner in \"Dry Rot\"; a street musician recruited as a secret agent in \"Simple Spymen\"; four identical brothers in \"One For the Pot\"; and a harassed civil servant in \"Chase Me, Comrade\". From \"Dry Rot\" onwards, Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn, in which the two performers played off one another rather as Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation.\n\nAlthough the five plays had long runs and packed houses, most London critics were snobbishly dismissive of them. Looking back in 1980, Michael Coveney wrote of the Whitehall farces, \"A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the National Theatre has done its duty by Priestley and Rattigan and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix … to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between Travers and Ayckbourn.\" The few London critics of the 1950s and 1960s who did not take a lofty view included Harold Hobson, Ronald Bryden, J. W. Lambert and Alan Dent.\n\nIn addition to the five long-running farces, Rix presented a series of more than eighty one-off televised comedies, some of them farces, for the BBC. The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956. There were also film versions of \"Reluctant Heroes\" (1951), \"Dry Rot\" (1956), and \"Chase Me, Comrade\", which was renamed \"Not Now, Comrade\" (1976).\n\nIn 1966, having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre, Rix took his company on tour in \"Chase Me, Comrade\" and \"Bang, Bang Beirut\" (later retitled \"Stand By Your Bedouin\"), by Cooney and Hilton. Later productions by the Rix company at the Garrick Theatre and elsewhere included \"Uproar in the House\", by Anthony Marriott and Alistair Foot (1967); \"Let Sleeping Wives Lie\" by Harold Brooke and Kay Bannerman (1967); \"She's Done It Again\", by Michael Pertwee (1969); \"Don't Just Lie There, Say Something\" (Pertwee, 1971); and \"A Bit Between the Teeth\" (Pertwee, 1974). According to Leslie Smith in a study of modern British farce, although some of the Rix productions after \"Chase Me, Comrade\" achieved substantial success, none of them had the conspicuously long runs of the five Whitehall farces. In 1976 Rix returned to the Whitehall with Fringe Benefits (Churchill and Cooney) which ran until 1977 when he retired from the stage.\n\n"}
