It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists, curators, critics, and historians.\n\n\"!Women Art Revolution\" is a documentary film, created by Lynn Hershman Leeson, to examine the under-recognized world of feminist art. Through interviews, documentary footage, and artworks, the film tracks the trajectory of feminist art. It begins at the start of the 1960s with antiwar and civil rights protests, it follows developments in feminist art through the 1970s.\n\nLynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists, curators, critics, and historians for over 4 decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in a variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as a result.The movie begins with a scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Hershman asks people to name 3 women artists, very few can name more than Frida Khalo. Hershman calls the film the, \"remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told.\" She says the events of the day led her to feel an, \"urgency to capture that moment\" and shoot whenever, wherever with a borrowed camera.\n\nThe film gets its name from the Women Artists in Revolution (WAR), which formed in the 1960's as a coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at a fundamental level, Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie, with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was, sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time.\n\nThe film overlays historical events with feminist art events, which were somewhat spurred on by these political events such as the Vietnam War, Black Panthers, Civil Rights Movement, Women's Liberation, and Free Speech Movement. She labels the 1968 Miss America Pageant as the moment when art and politics fused, culminating in a weeklong protest of art events.\n\nThe film mentions that minimalism was the popular art style of the time. Meant to be devoid of politics, this movement didn't match up with what was happening socially and politically. The feminist art movement worked to recognize contemporary political movements and social issues, creating a platform for awareness of these events.\n\n\nThe film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) 2010 as part of the Real to Reel category.\n\n\"!Women Art Revolution\" played at New York's IFC Center beginning June 1, 2011, before opening around the country.\n\nIn the film, Hershman states that the filming process, \"has accumulated (roughly) 12,428 minutes of footage,\" and \"!W.A.R.\" shows only 83 minutes, leaving 12,343 minutes of footage out. A digital archive was created to contain the two decades of Hershmann Leeson's interviews that went into creating this film and is available through the Stanford University Libraries collection, \"!W.A.R. Voices of a Movement\". According to the collection website, Hershmann Leeson desired this repository to \"be shared with as wide an audience as possible.\"\n\nBarry Keith Grant praises the film in his Film International piece, \"Leeson's film is a like a patchwork quilt of disparate footage, but in the end it all comes together to become an important feminist work. The film could well serve as required viewing for art and film students today.\"\n\nReviewer Ellen Druda says, \"This powerful film will ignite even the tiniest spark of feminism in any woman's heart. Not only art lovers will come away with a deeper understanding of the movement and an appreciation for those who stood up and paved the way.\"\n\nRichard Knight for the Windy City Times has a more critical view of the film, explaining, \"Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown, demanding parity with their male counterparts. However, by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists didn't want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts, the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own - just like those 'womyn only' coffeehouses that existed 'back in the day.' So, while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries - and annoyingly overlooks the artists feminist forebears (like O'Keeffe, Nevelson and Kahlo, for example) - !Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone.\"\n\nElisabeth Subrin states that \"Fusing history with memoir, Lynn Hershman Leeson enlists multiple visual strategies to produce an elegantly layered visual and sonic web of politics and powerful emotion. \"\n\n"}

The revue is based on an earlier 2011 revue, titled \"Cotton Club Parade\", which ran in concert at Encores! in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\"After Midnight\" is the Broadway production of \"Cotton Club Parade\" that premiered Off-Broadway at New York City Center's Encores! concert series in November 2011, starring Amber P. Riley in 2012 as the Special Guest Star and directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle with music direction by Jazz at Lincoln Center artistic director Wynton Marsalis. \"Cotton Club Parade\" played a return engagement in November 2012 at New York City Center Encores!. The \"Cotton Club Parade\" was conceived by Jack Viertel, artistic director of \"Encores!\", who said \"When we started rehearsals for 'Cotton Club Parade' in 2011, we knew we had something very special in store for audiences. Now that we’ve wrapped up our second run of this show at City Center, I couldn’t be more proud to have the show come to Broadway.\"\n\nThe revue takes place \"after midnight\" in New York's Harlem. It features jazz pieces by Duke Ellington, Jimmy McHugh, Dorothy Fields and Harold Arlen, framed by the poetry of Langston Hughes. The show features an orchestra of 17 musicians, 25 vocalists, dancers and performers. It is headlined by a rotating list of performers.\n\nThe Broadway production began previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on October 18, 2013 and opened on November 3, 2013 with special guest star Fantasia Barrino, who performed through February 9, 2014. The production features Dule Hill as \"The Host\", Adriane Lenox, Karine Plantadit and Desmond Richardson. Direction and choreography is by Warren Carlyle, with Scenic Design by John Lee Beatty, costumes by Isabel Toledo, lighting by Howell Binkley, and sound by Peter Hylenski.\n\nDancers and vocalists include: Julius \"iGlide\" Chisolm, Virgil J. Gadson, Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Jared Grimes, Everett Bradley, Cedric Neal, T. Oliver Reid, Monroe Kent III, Carmen Ruby Floyd, Rosena M. Hill Jackson, Bryonha Marie Parham, Marija Abney, Phillip Attmore, Christopher Broughton, Taeler Elyse Cyrus, C.K.

The show closed on June 29, 2014, after 272 performances and 19 previews; LaBelle was the final guest star. Gladys Knight and Natalie Cole were set to join the cast as special guest stars but the show closed before their set dates. \n\n\nStephen Holden, in his review of the \"Cotton Club Parade\" in 2011 for \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"The revue’s solution to the debatable issue of caricature and at what point a broad performance becomes a demeaning minstrel-show parody is to rein in the extremes. But it is in no way sedate. If the show has no Nell Carter or Ruth Brown, it does have Adriane Lenox, who delivers the Sippie Wallace advice song 'Women Be Wise'... with a knowing tang... Mr. Carlyle’s clean choreography connects variations of the Charleston with jitterbugging and a little break-dancing to suggest the continuity of styles without insisting on it.\"\n\nElysa Gardner in her review for \"USA Today\" wrote: \"...you get 90 minutes of honest, vital entertainment, delivered with enough breezy wit to mitigate the flashes of pomp.\" \n\nLinda Winer, in her review for \"Newsday\", noted that the most important part of the revue is the band. She wrote: \"When that push for slickness goes into overdrive, the ensemble can feel ragged... Adriane Lenox is marvelous in such sardonic, been-around revelations as 'Go Back Where You Stayed Last Night.' The dancers, led by former Twyla Tharp star Karine Plantadit, are strong.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20449611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20449611", "title": "Billy Mitchell (video game player)", "text": "Billy Mitchell (video game player)\n\nWilliam James Mitchell Jr. (born July 17, 1965) is an American restaurateur, businessman, and former competitive gamer. He initially rose to fame in the 1980s when \"Life\" magazine included him in a photo spread of video game champions during the height of the golden age of arcade video games. Though once recognized as the holder of several notable records on classic games, a 2018 investigation found several of Mitchell's scores to be fraudulent, having been obtained dishonestly. As a result, his scores were stricken from Twin Galaxies's rolls and \"Guinness World Records\", and he was banned from submitting any future scores.\n\nMitchell maintained a fan base throughout his public life as a leader in retro gaming, with David Ramsey, writing for the \"Oxford American\" in 2006, referring to Mitchell as \"probably the greatest arcade video game player of all time.\" Mitchell's signature achievement was a claim to have earned the first perfect score of 3,333,360 points on the original \"Pac-Man\" arcade game on July 4, 1999, which stood as the original record until April 2018, when it was stricken from the record along with his other scores.\n\nThroughout the early 2000s and 2010s, Mitchell was a frequently sought-after interview subject for documentaries on the worlds of competitive gaming and retro gaming, including \"\" (2007), \"The King of Arcades\" (2014), and \"Man vs Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler\" (2015). Additionally, Mitchell was a subject of the 2007 documentary \"The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters\" (2007), which follows his attempts to maintain his high score on \"Donkey Kong\" after it was threatened by a newcomer to the world of competitive gaming, Steve Wiebe. A VHS tape that Mitchell gave to Twin Galaxies during the course of the documentary proved to be instrumental in the 2018 investigation into Mitchell's cheating, with the team who led the investigation citing the film's DVD extras as a crucial piece of evidence in exposing Mitchell.\n\nIn addition to professional gaming, Mitchell owns the Rickey's World Famous Restaurant chain based in Hollywood, Florida, and sells a line of hot sauces known as Rickey's World Famous Sauces.\n\nMitchell was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and grew up in South Florida. He began playing games at age 12. Already a pinball player, he was initially uninterested in video games, which appeared in the early 1980s, until he noticed that \"everyone was standing around the \"Donkey Kong\" machine and wanted attention.\"\n\nMitchell attended Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School in 1983 and soon began work as a manager in the kitchen of his parents' restaurant, \"Rickey's Restaurant.\" Mitchell assumed ownership of the Rickey's World Famous Hot Sauce in the mid-1980s, continuing to own and manage it .\n\nIn 2015, Mitchell filed a lawsuit against Cartoon Network saying that in \"Regular Show\" a character who cheats at video games called Garrett Bobby Ferguson (GBF) infringed on his likeness. United States District Court for the District of New Jersey Judge Anne Elise Thompson threw out the lawsuit, saying that \"the television character does not match the plaintiff in appearance\".\n\nMitchell has a long-standing and well-publicized rivalry with his \"King of Kong\" co-star Roy Shildt (a.k.a. \"Mr. Awesome\"); according to that film, animosity first developed between the men after Mitchell caused Shildt's high score on Missile Command to be called into question. Shildt, in turn, has disputed Mitchell's credibility and accused him of cheating. In an incident during the 2010 \"International Video Game Hall of Fame\" Shildt was ejected from the premises after vehemently defaming Mitchell in public. Mitchell has stated that he avoids interaction with Shildt.\n\nMitchell has long hair and wears neckties showing American patriotism during game competitions. The neckties appeared during his 1999 race to become the first person to achieve a perfect game of \"Pac-Man.\" One of his competitors, Rick Fothergill, wore a Canadian flag cape and called himself \"Captain Canada.\" Mitchell began wearing his patriotic ties in response.\n\nMitchell's youngest child, William \"Billy\" Mitchell III, is ranked as a top American football prospect among kickers in the high school class of 2017.\n\nMitchell is the brother of Karen Harrington, a South Florida Republican politician who has run two unsuccessful campaigns (2010 and 2012) to replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nThe 2007 documentary \"The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters\" tells the story of newcomer Steve Wiebe's attempt to surpass Billy Mitchell's high score at the game \"Donkey Kong\", which Mitchell had set in 1982.\n\nMitchell never showed up to play the game in the film, though he states the importance of playing in public, saying, \"To me, most important is to travel to a sanctioned location, like Funspot that makes it official; if tomorrow Tiger Woods golfs a 59, big deal. If he does it at Augusta, that's where it counts.\" However, throughout the film Wiebe traveled to various locations such as Funspot to play him publicly, and each time Mitchell refused. More controversy arose when at Funspot, Wiebe set the \"Donkey Kong\" live score record and was given official recognition, something he did not receive for sending in a tape in which he scored the first million point game on record. A few hours later, a tape submitted by Mitchell in which he scored over a million points was accepted, and Wiebe lost his record. The film records speculation that Mitchell's tape may have been fraudulent. In Mitchell's hometown later on, Wiebe waited for four days to play Mitchell, who showed up one day and refused to play against Wiebe. In the film, Wiebe, while playing the game says hello to Mitchell, who does not respond, and says to his wife, as he walks away, \"There's certain people I don't want to spend too much time with\". Mitchell offers no explanation for his behavior towards Wiebe but later explained that at the time of filming, he had not played video games for \"more than a year\", and that the filmmakers had not given him enough advance warning to train for a public record-breaking attempt. Seth Gordon, the film's director, in referring to Mitchell's character says that Mitchell \"is a true puppet-master\", \"a master of information-control\" and that there was a lot of \"stuff we couldn't include because of inter-state telephone rules.\"\n\nAt the film's conclusion, Wiebe beats Mitchell's score to gain a new \"Donkey Kong\" record on tape.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Mitchell has stated that he never expected to play the role of the villain and did not anticipate hate mail and badgering phone calls he would receive post-release.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, on the 25th anniversary of Mitchell's first record-setting performance, Mitchell again retook the \"Donkey Kong\" record with a score of 1,050,200, though that score was surpassed on February 26, 2010 by Hank Chien, who was temporarily the record holder of \"Donkey Kong\". Mitchell reclaimed his title once again on July 24, 2010; it was the last time he would hold the record. The record was broken numerous times over the next six years by Wiebe, Chien, Wes Copeland, and Robbie Lakeman; each held the record at least twice in that span. On February 2, 2018, Robbie Lakeman set the new world record with 1,247,700.\n\nOn February 2, 2018, \"Donkey Kong\" Forum removed three of Mitchell's highest scores from its high-scores list following analysis by Jeremy Young who stated that the scores were set using the MAME arcade emulator instead of arcade hardware. Mitchell stated on the East Side Dave Show, \"I’ve never even played MAME. I don’t have MAME loaded in my home.\" Mitchell continues by saying \"The film footage that he has, that Jeremy has, shows MAME play... I’m not disputing what he says. What I’m disputing is the fact that I want him to have the original tape.” Young's analysis has been criticized by Mitchell as being from an altered tape that otherwise matches Mitchell's gameplay pixel-for-pixel, to which Young responds that \"The amount of foresight, patience, and technical knowledge required would be staggering\" to make such tapes.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, Twin Galaxies announced that an investigation conducted into Mitchell's submitted scores found conclusive evidence that Mitchell did not use an original unmodified \"Donkey Kong\" circuit board for the footage of his two high scores, but could not confirm that he was specifically using MAME software. Twin Galaxies said that they had removed Mitchell's scores from their records and that he would be prohibited from submitting scores in the future.\n\nSubsequently, Guinness World Records released a statement that it would be removing all of Mitchell's scores as well: \"The Guinness World Records titles relating to Mr. Mitchell’s highest scores on \"Donkey Kong\" have all been disqualified due to Twin Galaxies being our source of verification for these achievements.\" The removal also includes Mitchell's Pac-Man high score and first recorded perfect game: \"Twin Galaxies was the original source of verification for these record titles and in line with their decision to remove all of Mr. Mitchell’s records from their system, we have disqualified Mr. Mitchell as the holder of these two records.\"\n\nTo date, Mitchell has a single publicly witnessed \"Donkey Kong\" high score of 933,900 from 2004. In August 2018, Mitchell scored 1,047,500 on a Twitch live stream.\n\nMitchell set high score records on a number of games in the 1980s and 1990s. Decades after his 1982 setting of an initial highest score in \"Donkey Kong\", and after a return to record-breaking achievements between 2004 and 2010, others have matched or surpassed Mitchell's accomplishments. None of these records are considered valid by Twin Galaxies or by the Guinness Book of Records as of April 12, 2018.\n\n\nOn January 14, 1984, he was selected as one of the 1983 \"Video Game Players of the Year\" by Twin Galaxies and the U.S. National Video Game Team.\n\nOn September 17, 1999, he was proclaimed the \"Video Game Player of the Century\" while at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In a ceremony on the Namco stage, company founder Masaya Nakamura presented Mitchell with an award commemorating the first \"perfect\" game on \"Pac-Man\".\n\nOn November 24, 1999, he offered $100,000 to the first person who could get through \"Pac-Man\"'s \"split-screen level\". The prize was never claimed before the January 1, 2000 deadline.\n\nOn June 21, 2006, MTV selected Mitchell one of \"The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers of All Time.\" He was also nominated as leader of the Nerd Herd. Mitchell had been featured previously in the True Life episode \"I'm A Gamer\" in 2003.\n\nMitchell placed eighth out of eight in the Microsoft Xbox 360 \"Pac-Man\" World Championships on June 4, 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Mitchell became the first video game player to be honored with a Topps Allen & Ginter trading card.\n\nIn the 2015 feature film \"Pixels\", Peter Dinklage plays former video game champion \"Eddie\", with physical appearance and personality styled after Mitchell and other gamers.\n\nA character similar to Mitchell called Garrett Bobby Ferguson (GBF) appears in \"Regular Show\". Mitchell, however, took offense at the portrayal (a villain who cheats at video games) and filed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by the judge.\n\n\n\n"}

The 1903 short film \"The Great Train Robbery\" was the first to apply this convention. Two exceptions to the convention were portrayals by William Boyd (active 1918–1954), who wore dark clothing as Hopalong Cassidy, and Robert Taylor's portrayal in the film \"The Law and Jake Wade\" (1958).\n\nThe book \"Investigating Information Society\" said the convention was arbitrarily imposed by filmmakers in the genre with the expectation that audiences would understand the categorizations. It said whiteness was associated with \"purity, cleanliness, and moral righteousness\", which is reminiscent of a woman's wedding dress traditionally being white. The book said, \"The difference, of course, has to do with particular cultural conceptions of gender and sexuality and the context within which white is worn.\"\n\nIn the 21st century, Western films referenced the convention in different ways. In the 2005 film \"Brokeback Mountain\", one of the two starring cowboys wears black while the other wears white. The film does not disclose any standard conventions for the symbolism other than the wearer of the black hat being shot like in early films. In the 2007 film \"\", a remake of , a henchman hiring local gunmen to free his boss from jail, tells them not to shoot at \"the black hat\", a light reference to the convention.\n\nThis convention gave rise to the terms black hat and white hat to refer to malicious and ethical hackers respectively.\n"}

Following 1830s, the large number of stories and fables adapted and translated from various traditional and western sources started to appear in Gujarati. Led by Gijubhai Badheka and Nanabhai Bhatt, the children's literature expanded rapidly in form of stories, poems, rhymes and riddles. Several authors and poets wrote for children intermittently and exclusively. Large number of magazines catering to children were published by middle of twentieth century. Later adventure novels, science fiction, young-adult fiction were also published. Ramanlal Soni and Jivram Joshi contributed for five decades creating stories, fictional characters and novels. Few children's plays were published while the biographies of historical characters appeared frequently.\n\nThere are several stories popular in Gujarati folk literature which relate to children. There is a long tradition of Purana stories in Indian literature which deals with topics, particularly myths, legends and other traditional lore. The stories derived from \"Ramayana\", \"Mahabharata\", \"Panchtantra\", \"Hitopadesha\" and anecdotes of \"Akbar-Birbal\", \"Bhoja-Kalidas\", \"Singhasan Battisi\", \"Baital Pachisi\", \"Śukasaptati\" are told to children for generations.\n\nThe current form of children's literature started after the education in Gujarati was aligned to western pattern in 1826 during British Raj. The Native Schools and Books Society established in Bombay in 1820 had published books for new schools. They were for co-curriculum reading. Initial works in Gujarati children's literature were translations and adaptations. In 1826, Bapulal Shastri Pandya translated \"Aesop's Fables\" in Gujarati as \"Aesop Nitikathao\". In next few years more translations of Aesop's Fables published. The \"Gulliver's Travels\" translated as \"Gulliverni Musafari\". In 1831, the two parts of \"Balamitra\" was published starting an era of current form of children's literature. It had poems, stories, anecdotes and jokes. Ranchhodbhai Dave published \"Isapnitini Vato\" adapted from \"Aesop's Fables\" in 1859. The Bombay Education Society published four books in 1840; \"Shishusadbodhmala\", \"Balamitra\", \"Balasathi\" and \"Panch Pakhaon\" (\"Panchapakhyana\"); having poems, stories, anecdotes, biographies for children. Amichandra wrote \"Batrish Pultini Varta\" based on \"Singhasan Battisi\".\n\nInitially there were translations of stories from classic Indian literature. \"Tunki Kahanio\" (1881) published by Anubhai Neelkanth had 118 translated stories. Hargovingdas Kantawala published adapted short stories \"Tachukadi So Vaat\" in six volumes. He also wrote novel regarding misrule of the foolish king in 1887. He also published \"Kanyavanchanamala\", the first book exclusively for girls. Ichchharam Desai translated \"Evenings at Home\" as \"Balako No Anand\" (1895). He also wrote \"Ghashiram Kotwal\" (1903) based on Ghashiram from Maratha history. Jaysukhlal Joshipura adapted \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" as \"Alka no Adbhut Pravas\". Narayan Hemchandra wrote \"Mahabharat Ni Vartao\" (1904) based on events from the epic \"Mahabharata\". Manchharam Ghelaram edited a collection of tales, \"Murakho\", the fool, which was a theme on which several others had written. Sharda Mehta published \"Puranvarta Sangraha\" (1906) based on mythological tales from Purana. Kalyanrag Joshi published \"Deshdeshni Vato\" (1914) and \"Vigyan ni Vato\" (1914) about worldview and science respectively.\n\nThe original children's literature rapidly expanded due to efforts of Gijubhai Badheka who was actively involved in reforms in children's education. He started the musical literature for children and is considered the father of children's literature in Gujarati. He published five books in 1922 and later cofounded a school, Dakshinamoorti, in Bhavnagar which published large number of books for children. He was joined by Jugatram Dave, Taraben Modak, Mulshankar Bhatt, Vishnu Trivedi, Harbhai Trivedi, Ramnarayan Pathak, and several others. Nanabhai Bhatt published stories based on characters from \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" as well as \"Hindu Dharma ni Akhyayikao\" for young adults.

Hansa Jivraj Mehta wrote \"Balvartavali\", \"Arun Nu Adbhut Swapna\", \"Baval Na Parakramo\". Chandrashankar Bhatt published \"Balmitra\" which published stories which were later collected as \"Balmitra Ni Vato\", \"Sindbad Sheth\", \"Kumar Veersen\".\n\nTwo major authors who published extensively in children's literature were Ramanlal Soni and Jivram Joshi who contributed for more than five decades. Ramanlal Joshi created \"Galbo Shiyal\" and associated animal stories. His \"Mangalu\" was popular among children. Jivram Joshi created several popular characters including Miya Fuski, Chhel-Chhabo, Chhako-Mako, Adukiyo-Dadukiyo.

In 1848, Dalpatram wrote humorous children's poetry from inspiration from earlier fables. When new education department was formed by the British authorities, he had edited series of new Gujarati textbooks under leadership of Theodore Hope. His was perhapse the first original writing for children in Gujarati which also included first children's poem. His \"Andheri Nagari Ne Gandu Raja\", \"Dayali Ma\", \"Sharanaivalo\" and \"Unt Na Adhar Ang Vanka\" are notable among them. These poems has simple story; simple tune, words and rhymes; message with humour. In 1866, Navalram Pandya had written garba songs for children which were published in \"Shalapatra\" and later as \"Bal Garbavali\". One song of it \"Janavarni Jan\" became very popular. Nhanalal also wrote poetry for children. His \"Ganya Ganay Nahi, Vinya Vinay Nahi\" is popular among children. \"Balakavya\" (1915) by Krishnaprasad Bhatt had poems with natural rhymes. \"Ajab Jevi Vaat Chhe\" by Upendracharyaji was very popular.

They were published in 1979. Snehrashmi wrote popular prayer \"Namie Tujne Varamvar\". He also experimented with \"Haiku\" format. \"Tarapo\" (1980) and \"Ujani\" (1980) are his poetry collections. His experiences as a teacher and a poet are visible in his poems. His poems has tunes and rhymes which can be easily captured by children as well as they are singable; filled with imagination, inspiration and entertainment.

Suresh Dalal published more than dozen poetry collections including \"Ittakitta\" and \"Tingatoli\" (1976) in his three decade long career. According to Harikrishna Pathak, Dalal brought children's poetry from its rural background to urban setup. \n\nRamesh Parekh is prolific children's poet of modern era. His command on tune, novelty, amazement, imagination, teasing writing style are visible in his poetry. \"Hauk\" (1978), \"Chin\" (1980), \"Itta, Kitta Ane Buchcha\", \"Dariyo Zullam Zulla\", \"Hasie Khullam Khulla\" are his collections.

For example, in the first four lines of William Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 130\", Shakespeare contrasts a mistress to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.\n\nContrast is the antonym of simile. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, John Donne and the metaphysical poets developed the conceit as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In Renaissance poetry, and particularly in sonnets, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of \"my love is unlike all other women\" or \"I am unlike her other loves\".\n\nIn the early 18th century, a theory of wit developed by English writers (particularly John Locke) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In lyric poetry, the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.\n"}
{"id": "657958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657958", "title": "Cooperative game theory", "text": "Cooperative game theory\n\nIn game theory, a cooperative game (or coalitional game) is a game with competition between groups of players (\"coalitions\") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). Those are opposed to non-cooperative games in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).\n\nCooperative games are often analysed through the framework of cooperative game theory, which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional non-cooperative game theory which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing Nash equilibria.\n\nCooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows the analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\n\nA cooperative game is given by specifying a value for every coalition. Formally, the coalitional game consists of a finite set of players formula_1, called the \"grand coalition\", and a \"characteristic function\" formula_2 from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments that satisfies formula_3. The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition, and the game is sometimes called a \"value game\" or a \"profit game\". \n\nConversely, a cooperative game can also be defined with a characteristic cost function formula_4 satisfying formula_5. In this setting, players must accomplish some task, and the characteristic function formula_6 represents the cost of a set of players accomplishing the task together. A game of this kind is known as a \"cost game\". Although most cooperative game theory deals with profit games, all concepts can easily be translated to the cost setting.\n\nThe \"Harsanyi dividend\" (named after John Harsanyi, who used it to generalize the Shapley value in 1963) identifies the surplus that is created by a coalition of players in a cooperative game. To specify this surplus, the worth of this coalition is corrected by the surplus that is already created by subcoalitions. To this end, the dividend formula_7 of coalition formula_8 in game formula_9 is recursively determined by\n\nformula_10\n\nAn explicit formula for the dividend is given by formula_11. The function formula_12 is also known as the Möbius inverse of formula_13. Indeed, we can recover formula_9 from formula_15 by help of the formula formula_16. \n\nHarsanyi dividends are useful for analyzing both games and solution concepts, e.g. the Shapley value is obtained by distributing the dividend of each coalition among its members, i.e., the Shapley value formula_17 of player formula_18 in game formula_9 is given by summing up a player's share of the dividends of all coalitions that she belongs to, formula_20.\n\nLet formula_21 be a profit game. The \"dual game\" of formula_21 is the cost game formula_23 defined as\n\nIntuitively, the dual game represents the opportunity cost for a coalition formula_25 of not joining the grand coalition formula_1. A dual profit game formula_27 can be defined identically for a cost game formula_6. A cooperative game and its dual are in some sense equivalent, and they share many properties. For example, the core of a game and its dual are equal. For more details on cooperative game duality, see for instance .\n\nLet formula_29 be a non-empty coalition of players. The \"subgame\" formula_30 on formula_25 is naturally defined as\n\nIn other words, we simply restrict our attention to coalitions contained in formula_25. Subgames are useful because they allow us to apply solution concepts defined for the grand coalition on smaller coalitions.\n\nCharacteristic functions are often assumed to be superadditive . This means that the value of a union of disjoint coalitions is no less than the sum of the coalitions' separate values:\n\nformula_34 whenever formula_35 satisfy formula_36.\n\nLarger coalitions gain more:\n\nformula_37. \n\nThis follows from superadditivity. i.e. if payoffs are normalized so singleton coalitions have zero value.\n\nA coalitional game is considered simple if payoffs are either 1 or 0, i.e. coalitions are either \"winning\" or \"losing\".\n\nEquivalently, a simple game can be defined as a collection of coalitions, where the members of are called winning coalitions, and the others losing coalitions.\nIt is sometimes assumed that a simple game is nonempty or that it does not contain an empty set. However, in other areas of mathematics, simple games are also called hypergraphs or Boolean functions (logic functions).\n\n\nA few relations among the above axioms have widely been recognized, such as the following\n(e.g., Peleg, 2002, Section 2.1):\n\n\nMore generally, a complete investigation of the relation among the four conventional axioms\n(monotonicity, properness, strongness, and non-weakness), finiteness, and algorithmic computability\nhas been made (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011),\nwhose results are summarized in the Table \"Existence of Simple Games\" below.\n\nThe restrictions that various axioms for simple games impose on their Nakamura number were also studied extensively. \nIn particular, a computable simple game without a veto player has a Nakamura number greater than 3 only if it is a \"proper\" and \"non-strong\" game.\n\nLet \"G\" be a strategic (non-cooperative) game. Then, assuming that coalitions have the ability to enforce coordinated behaviour, there are several cooperative games associated with \"G\". These games are often referred to as \"representations of G\". The two standard representations are:\n\n\nThe main assumption in cooperative game theory is that the grand coalition formula_1 will form. The challenge is then to allocate the payoff formula_53 among the players in some fair way. (This assumption is not restrictive, because even if players split off and form smaller coalitions, we can apply solution concepts to the subgames defined by whatever coalitions actually form.) A \"solution concept\" is a vector formula_54 that represents the allocation to each player. Researchers have proposed different solution concepts based on different notions of fairness. Some properties to look for in a solution concept include:\n\n\nAn efficient payoff vector is called a \"pre-imputation\", and an individually rational pre-imputation is called an imputation. Most solution concepts are imputations.\n\nThe stable set of a game (also known as the \"von Neumann-Morgenstern solution\" ) was the first solution proposed for games with more than 2 players. Let formula_21 be a game and let formula_68, formula_85 be two imputations of formula_21. Then formula_68 \"dominates\" formula_85 if some coalition formula_89 satisfies formula_90 and formula_91. In other words, players in formula_25 prefer the payoffs from formula_68 to those from formula_85, and they can threaten to leave the grand coalition if formula_85 is used because the payoff they obtain on their own is at least as large as the allocation they receive under formula_68.\n\nA \"stable set\" is a set of imputations that satisfies two properties:\n\n\nVon Neumann and Morgenstern saw the stable set as the collection of acceptable behaviours in a society: None is clearly preferred to any other, but for each unacceptable behaviour there is a preferred alternative. The definition is very general allowing the concept to be used in a wide variety of game formats.\n\n\nLet formula_21 be a game. The \"core\" of formula_21 is the set of payoff vectors\n\nIn words, the core is the set of imputations under which no coalition has a value greater than the sum of its members' payoffs. Therefore, no coalition has incentive to leave the grand coalition and receive a larger payoff.\n\n\nFor simple games, there is another notion of the core, when each player is assumed to have preferences on a set formula_102 of alternatives.\nA \"profile\" is a list formula_103 of individual preferences formula_104 on formula_102.\nHere formula_106 means that individual formula_18 prefers alternative formula_108\nto formula_109 at profile formula_110.\nGiven a simple game formula_9 and a profile formula_110, a \"dominance\" relation formula_113 is defined\non formula_102 by formula_115 if and only if there is a winning coalition formula_8\n(i.e., formula_117) satisfying formula_106 for all formula_119.\nThe \"core\" formula_120 of the simple game formula_9 with respect to the profile formula_110 of preferences\nis the set of alternatives undominated by formula_113\n(the set of maximal elements of formula_102 with respect to formula_113):\n\nThe \"Nakamura number\" of a simple game is the minimal number of winning coalitions with empty intersection.\n\"Nakamura's theorem\" states that the core formula_120 is nonempty for all profiles formula_110 of \"acyclic\" (alternatively, \"transitive\") preferences\nif and only if formula_102 is finite \"and\" the cardinal number (the number of elements) of formula_102 is less than the Nakamura number of formula_9.\nA variant by Kumabe and Mihara states that the core formula_120 is nonempty for all profiles formula_110 of preferences that have a \"maximal element\"\nif and only if the cardinal number of formula_102 is less than the Nakamura number of formula_9. (See Nakamura number for details.)\n\nBecause the core may be empty, a generalization was introduced in . The \"strong formula_138-core\" for some number formula_139 is the set of payoff vectors\n\nIn economic terms, the strong formula_138-core is the set of pre-imputations where no coalition can improve its payoff by leaving the grand coalition, if it must pay a penalty of formula_138 for leaving. Note that formula_138 may be negative, in which case it represents a bonus for leaving the grand coalition. Clearly, regardless of whether the core is empty, the strong formula_138-core will be non-empty for a large enough value of formula_138 and empty for a small enough (possibly negative) value of formula_138. Following this line of reasoning, the \"least-core\", introduced in , is the intersection of all non-empty strong formula_138-cores. It can also be viewed as the strong formula_138-core for the smallest value of formula_138 that makes the set non-empty .\n\nThe \"Shapley value\" is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, and satisfies monotonicity. It was introduced by Lloyd Shapley who showed that it is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, additive, and assigns zero payoffs to dummy players. The Shapley value of a superadditive game is individually rational, but this is not true in general. \n\nLet formula_2 be a game, and let formula_54 be an efficient payoff vector. The \"maximum surplus\" of player \"i\" over player \"j\" with respect to \"x\" is\n\nthe maximal amount player \"i\" can gain without the cooperation of player \"j\" by withdrawing from the grand coalition \"N\" under payoff vector \"x\", assuming that the other players in \"i\"'s withdrawing coalition are satisfied with their payoffs under \"x\". The maximum surplus is a way to measure one player's bargaining power over another. The \"kernel\" of formula_9 is the set of imputations \"x\" that satisfy\n\n\nfor every pair of players \"i\" and \"j\". Intuitively, player \"i\" has more bargaining power than player \"j\" with respect to imputation \"x\" if formula_156, but player \"j\" is immune to player \"i\"'s threats if formula_157, because he can obtain this payoff on his own. The kernel contains all imputations where no player has this bargaining power over another. This solution concept was first introduced in .\n\nLet formula_2 be a game, and let formula_54 be a payoff vector. The \"excess\" of formula_68 for a coalition formula_161 is the quantity formula_162; that is, the gain that players in coalition formula_25 can obtain if they withdraw from the grand coalition formula_1 under payoff formula_68 and instead take the payoff formula_166.\n\nNow let formula_167 be the vector of excesses of formula_68, arranged in non-increasing order. In other words, formula_169. Notice that formula_68 is in the core of formula_21 if and only if it is a pre-imputation and formula_172. To define the nucleolus, we consider the lexicographic ordering of vectors in formula_173: For two payoff vectors formula_174, we say formula_175 is lexicographically smaller than formula_176 if for some index formula_177, we have formula_178 and formula_179. (The ordering is called lexicographic because it mimics alphabetical ordering used to arrange words in a dictionary.) The \"nucleolus\" of formula_21 is the lexicographically minimal imputation, based on this ordering. This solution concept was first introduced in .\n\nAlthough the definition of the nucleolus seems abstract, gave a more intuitive description: Starting with the least-core, record the coalitions for which the right-hand side of the inequality in the definition of formula_181 cannot be further reduced without making the set empty. Continue decreasing the right-hand side for the remaining coalitions, until it cannot be reduced without making the set empty. Record the new set of coalitions for which the inequalities hold at equality; continue decreasing the right-hand side of remaining coalitions and repeat this process as many times as necessary until all coalitions have been recorded. The resulting payoff vector is the nucleolus.\n\n\nIntroduced by Shapley in , convex cooperative games capture the intuitive property some games have of \"snowballing\". Specifically, a game is \"convex\" if its characteristic function formula_21 is supermodular:\n\nIt can be shown (see, e.g., Section V.1 of ) that the supermodularity of formula_21 is equivalent to\n\nthat is, \"the incentives for joining a coalition increase as the coalition grows\" , leading to the aforementioned snowball effect. For cost games, the inequalities are reversed, so that we say the cost game is \"convex\" if the characteristic function is submodular.\n\nConvex cooperative games have many nice properties:\n\n\nSubmodular and supermodular set functions are also studied in combinatorial optimization. Many of the results in have analogues in , where submodular functions were first presented as generalizations of matroids. In this context, the core of a convex cost game is called the \"base polyhedron\", because its elements generalize base properties of matroids.\n\nHowever, the optimization community generally considers submodular functions to be the discrete analogues of convex functions , because the minimization of both types of functions is computationally tractable. Unfortunately, this conflicts directly with Shapley's original definition of supermodular functions as \"convex\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Often, extended scenes are included in collections of deleted scenes or are referred to as deleted scenes themselves, as is the case with for instance, \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and \"Serenity\".\n\nScenes are often removed from films at the request of a studio or network, or to reduce running time or to improve narrative flow.\n\nThe studio or network planning to air or distribute it may be uncomfortable with a certain scene. It may ask for it be altered, removed, or replaced.\n\nThat is most common in the production of television series since networks and channels often must be mindful of how viewers, critics, or censors will react to programming. There may be a fear of losing ratings, being punished by fines or otherwise, or having trouble finding advertisers.\n\n\n\nConcerns about running time may also cause scenes to be removed or shortening.\n\nIn feature films, scenes may be cut to reduce the length of the film's theatrical cut. In television serials, however, running time becomes an even greater concern because of the strict timeslot limitations, especially on channels supported by advertisements, and there may be only 20 minutes of actual show per half-hour timeslot. Depending on the station and the particular format of the show, that may or may not include opening credits or closing credits; many ad-supported stations now \"squish\" the closing credits or force them into a split-screen to show more advertising. Most programs are in either a half-hour or a one-hour timeslot. That forces producers of television serials to break up the acts in a manner that will (hopefully) make the viewer want to continue watching after the ad break and to avoid exceeding the stricter running time limits.\n\nThough the quality of the initial and the final cuts of a film is subjective, a scene or version of a scene in a film may have an adverse effect on the film as a whole. It may slow the film down, provide unnecessary details or exposition, or even explain points that should be implied or said more subtly. It is common to remove such scenes at the editing level, but they may be released on the home video release, as a bonus feature.\n\nThere are at least a few examples, including a number of the deleted scenes on the DVD release of the sequel film \"Serenity\" (in fact, the audio commentary on the DVD's deleted scenes collection quite often mentions the plot or the tension being disrupted or slowed by including a scene or too much expositional as the main reason for the scene's removal from the final theatrical cut. Another well known example is the cocoon sequence in the film \"Alien\". The scene added a lot of information about the fate of several crew members and new information on the life cycle of the creature, but it was ultimately deleted, as it was thought to slow down and to disrupt the tension of the end of the film.\n\nDeleted or extended scenes may be in any of several different formats. They may or may not feature finished special effects (especially in science fiction and fantasy films in which visual effects are more expensive), and the film quality may or may not be the same as in the rest of the film, but that may depend only on how much post-production editing was done.\n\nAdditionally, deleted scenes of animated films may not be in the form of a fully animated scene but instead be included in the form of an animatic or a blooper form, as is the case with the deleted scenes on the DVD release of Pixar's \"Toy Story\" and \"Finding Nemo\".\n\nThe DVD release for \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s feature film also featured not only a handful of regular deleted scenes but also two spoof \"Really Deleted\" scenes.\n\n\"YTV\"s ZAPX sometimes makes \"deleted scenes\" that are not genuine deleted scenes but random scenes of the movie with footage of the program's host, Simon, inserted into the clip, for that purpose.\n\nOn the DVD for \"UHF\", \"Weird Al\" Yankovic provides commentary of the deleted scenes and emphasizes that there are hours of film footage but that they were all removed for good reasons.\n\n"}

During a game of \"Scenes From a Hat,\" Drew pulled out the subject \"books least likely to be checked out at the library\" and friend Ryan Stiles acted as if he was picking a book and read the title \"Dirty Jokes and Beer.\"\n\nThe book is divided into three sections, which are referred to in the title. All of the chapters within the first two sections (save for \"101 Big-Dick Jokes\", which \"would be redundant\") are preceded by a dirty joke Carey has heard over the years.\n\nThe first section deals with Drew's views on various topics, such as being at airports (he writes that he likes to ride around in the carts to make people move out of his way) and the difference between Las Vegas and Atlantic City. (Carey writes that he prefers Las Vegas, as he sees Atlantic City as being filled with retired people shuffling around, playing nickel slot machines.) The section ends with \"101 Big Dick Jokes\".\n\nThis section of the book contains the autobiographical stories. Drew briefly discusses his upbringing and his time with the United States Marines, as well as his experiences working on his show. In this section, he also includes reviews about his show, both positive and negative, as well as some of the notes he received from network censors about the show's content.\n\nThis section contains five short stories that Drew wrote for the book. He describes these stories as being \"Drew in \"The Twilight Zone,\"\" where he takes some elements from his life and changes them into fictional stories where he is the main protagonist of the stories. These short stories are not preceded by dirty jokes. The very first story \"Mi Plea\" was a completely true story, except for the ending. And the stories about his friend Larry and girlfriend Natalie were completely fabricated. As was his story about himself in Las Vegas.\n"}

They depict battles, romance, religion, folk tales, and stories of the supernatural world. \n\nThe handscroll and the hanging scroll are the two most common forms of Japanese painting. Handscrolls are painted on paper or silk, backed with paper. The farthest (left) end is fitted with a roller around which the scroll is rolled. When rolled up, the scrolls are secured with a braided silk cord and can be safely carried, placed on shelves, or stored in a lacquerware box. Handscrolls range in size, averaging 30 centimeters (1 ft.) in height and 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 ft.) in length. A normal story covers one to three scrolls.\n\"Emakimono\" are read by exposing an arms-length of the scroll at a time, from right to left, as Japanese is written. It was common for there to be a written account of the story being illustrated either at the start of the scroll, or interspersed between the pictures. It is expected that the person viewing the scroll will re-roll the scroll back in its original form, much as one is supposed to rewind video tape after viewing it.\n\n\"Emakimono\" also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the \"otoko-e\" (Men's pictures) and \"onna-e\" (Women's pictures) styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. \"Onna-e\", epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. \"Otoko-e\", on the other hand, often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The Siege of the Sanjō Palace (1160), depicted in the painting \"Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace\" is a famous example of this style.\n\nThe most often discussed example of \"emakimono\" is the \"Genji monogatari emaki\" dating from about 1130. This \"emaki\" illustrates Murasaki Shikibu's epic \"The Tale of Genji\". Written about the year 1000, the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death. While only 15% of the original scrolls remain, the fragments are protected as national treasures.\n\nThe \"Chōjū giga\" (Scroll of Frolicking Animals) is unusual in its own medium, as it does not contain any text, only pictures. It depicts scenes of animals in amusing scenes, analogizing Japanese society in the 12th century.\n\n\n\n"}

Flip Flaps come in different models like the \"Q\" (which is round) and \"F\" (which has the shape of a flower pot). The big Flip Flaps (depends on the number) usually have three movements. Once you turn it on, the leaves begin to move up and down. If you tap one of the leaves, it shall begin to move seesaw to the direction in which the leaf was tapped.\n\nAs with other Tomy manufactured solar powered toys, there are fake Flip Flaps being sold in stores. These are often cheaply made in China and are limited to only an up-and-down motion, and are incapable of the 3 different movements characteristic of authentic Flip Flaps. The fake and real versions look extremely similar, but consumers can differentiate between the two by looking for the Tomy logo, almost entirely Japanese characters on the box (limited English), and dark green leaves (fake Flip Flaps have light green leaves, as opposed to the darker, real ones of slightly better quality). Other Flip Flap knockoffs are sold that are solely inspired by Flip Flaps, but not directly based on Flip Flaps, as they are sold in very different packaging than the authentic ones and have flowers that look different.\n\nAccording to the EU patent database, the patent was copied by a small Chinese company called \"SHENZHEN LONGGANG PINGHU TENGY\".

{"id": "317419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317419", "title": "Game complexity", "text": "Game complexity\n\nCombinatorial game theory has several ways of measuring game complexity. This article describes five of them: state-space complexity, game tree size, decision complexity, game-tree complexity, and computational complexity.\n\nThe state-space complexity of a game is the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game.\n\nWhen this is too hard to calculate, an upper bound can often be computed by including illegal positions or positions that can never arise in the course of a game.\n\nThe game tree size is the total number of possible games that can be played: the number of leaf nodes in the game tree rooted at the game's initial position.\n\nThe game tree is typically vastly larger than the state space because the same positions can occur in many games by making moves in a different order (for example, in a tic-tac-toe game with two X and one O on the board, this position could have been reached in two different ways depending on where the first X was placed). An upper bound for the size of the game tree can sometimes be computed by simplifying the game in a way that only increases the size of the game tree (for example, by allowing illegal moves) until it becomes tractable.\n\nHowever, for games where the number of moves is not limited (for example by the size of the board, or by a rule about repetition of position) the game tree is infinite.\n\nThe next two measures use the idea of a \"decision tree\", which is a subtree of the game tree, with each position labelled with \"player A wins\", \"player B wins\" or \"drawn\", if that position can be proved to have that value (assuming best play by both sides) by examining only other positions in the graph. (Terminal positions can be labelled directly; a position with player A to move can be labelled \"player A wins\" if any successor position is a win for A, or labelled \"player B wins\" if all successor positions are wins for B, or labelled \"draw\" if all successor positions are either drawn or wins for B. And correspondingly for positions with B to move.)\n\nDecision complexity of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.\n\nThe game-tree complexity of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest \"full-width\" decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position. A full-width tree includes all nodes at each depth.\n\nThis is an estimate of the number of positions one would have to evaluate in a minimax search to determine the value of the initial position.\n\nIt is hard even to estimate the game-tree complexity, but for some games a reasonable lower bound can be given by raising the game's average branching factor to the power of the number of plies in an average game, or:\n\nformula_1.\n\nThe computational complexity of a game describes the asymptotic difficulty of a game as it grows arbitrarily large, expressed in big O notation or as membership in a complexity class. This concept doesn't apply to particular games, but rather to games that have been generalized so they can be made arbitrarily large, typically by playing them on an \"n\"-by-\"n\" board. (From the point of view of computational complexity a game on a fixed size of board is a finite problem that can be solved in O(1), for example by a look-up table from positions to the best move in each position.)\n\nThe asymptotic complexity is defined by the most efficient (in terms of whatever computational resource one is considering) algorithm for solving the game; the most common complexity measure (computation time) is always lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity, since a solution algorithm must work for every possible state of the game. It will be upper-bounded by the complexities of each individual algorithm for the family of games. Similar remarks apply to the second-most commonly used complexity measure, the amount of space or computer memory used by the computation. It is not obvious that there is any lower bound on the space complexity for a typical game, because the algorithm need not store game states; however many games of interest are known to be PSPACE-hard, and it follows that their space complexity will be lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity as well (technically the bound is only a polynomial in this quantity; but it is usually known to be linear).\n\nFor tic-tac-toe, a simple upper bound for the size of the state space is 3 = 19,683. (There are three states for each cell and nine cells.) This count includes many illegal positions, such as a position with five crosses and no noughts, or a position in which both players have a row of three. A more careful count, removing these illegal positions, gives 5,478. And when rotations and reflections of positions are considered identical, there are only 765 essentially different positions.\n\nA simple upper bound for the size of the game tree is 9! = 362,880. (There are nine positions for the first move, eight for the second, and so on.) This includes illegal games that continue after one side has won. A more careful count gives 255,168 possible games. When rotations and reflections of positions are considered the same, there are only 26,830 possible games.\n\nThe computational complexity of tic-tac-toe depends on how it is generalized. A natural generalization is to \"m\",\"n\",\"k\"-games: played on an \"m\" by \"n\" board with winner being the first player to get \"k\" in a row. It is immediately clear that this game can be solved in DSPACE(\"mn\") by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class PSPACE. With some more work it can be shown to be PSPACE-complete.\n\nDue to the large size of game complexities, this table gives the ceiling of their logarithm to base 10. (In other words, the number of digits). All of the following numbers should be considered with caution: seemingly-minor changes to the rules of a game can change the numbers (which are often rough estimates anyway) by tremendous factors, which might easily be much greater than the numbers shown.\n\nNote: ordered by game tree size\n\n\n"}

Started in 1998 by a group of volunteers, GfG was led by industry veteran Lynne Killey. It raises money and requests that game publishers donate video and computer games to them for re-distribution to children's charities. It hosts dinners, silent auctions and parties.\n\nIn just a few years, the small undertaking had grown too large for a volunteer staff to handle and the effort was left dormant. In the following years several other game industry charities took up the effort of supporting individual children's charities in meaningful and productive ways, but none utilizing the repository model of supporting other charities.\n\nThe IEMA (Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association), the U.S. trade association which represents the game industry's leading retailers, began receiving in three finished copies of each and every computer game manufactured due to a royalty-free licensing agreement that the association has with publishers. That agreement standardized the PC game box - reducing it from the oversized software standard, down to the now double-thick DVD size that we're all used to - and also standardized the PC CD and PC DVD icons (the small black and white logos that indicate the platform the game is created for). The IEMA has been donating the games to children's hospitals and local area charities and schools when long-time friends Lynne Killey (the founder of GfG) and Hal Halpin (the president of the IEMA) decided to restart the organizations.\n\nNow re-launched, Games for Good is being run by the IEMA's staff. In addition to asking game publishers and developers to provide the three finished copies of each PC game they make, GfG is also asking for them to commit to providing three finished copies of all games they create on all platforms AND to help them with sponsorship funds. \n"}

Some Gang Shows have leaders of Scouts and Guides on stage too. Leaders, youth members and parents help behind the scenes. The aim is, through performance, to empower young people to make a positive contribution to society. \n\nThe production teams and cast (all volunteers) plan, write, compose, choreograph, build scenery and props, make costumes and rehearse for several months. A typical show requires 3 to 6 months of rehearsals. Every show does it differently, but every show has the same three priorities. 1. it is for the young people - 2. it is a public shop window on Scouting & Guiding, and therefore a great PR opportunity - 3. If they are lucky, they will at least break even. \n\nPerformance runs range from one day to two weeks, and tickets are available to the public. While a Gang Show is purely an amateur production, the costs can be similar to a professional production.\n\nThe format is a revue or variety show; song, dance and short comedy sketches are the most common. The number of items varies between 12 and 25, some stand-alone, others a series of songs to a chosen theme or a running gag.\n\nThe format was created by Ralph Reader, the original producer, who wrote material including the signature tune, \"Crest of a Wave\". Other \"standards\" Reader wrote include \"Strolling\", \"Great Great Game\", \"Gee, It's A Wonderful life\", \"A Touch of Silver\", \"Three Cheers\", \"Show Time\", \"Together\", \"These are the Times\" and \"The Scout Hymn\".\n\nIn 1931, Reader, a Rover Scout trying to make his mark in theatre in the USA and London, was asked to write a Scout-based variety show to raise money for a swimming pool at Downe Scout Camp (now a Scout Association National Activity Centre). Rehearsals began under Reader's direction on 25 May 1932, his 29th birthday.\n\nInitially the show did not have a title, but during a rehearsal break, Reader recalled, he asked a cast member if everyone was ready, to which the response was \"Aye, aye Skip, the gang's all here\". The first production, \"The Gang's All Here\", ran between 30 October and 1 November 1932 at the Scala Theatre in central London.\n\nThe show was not a sell-out but enough was raised to fund the swimming pool and the show was well received. Baden-Powell, the founder of scouting, persuaded Reader to produce another show in 1933. This was \"The Gang Comes Back\" and ran for a week.\n\nReader continued to write and produce the London Gang Show. In 1934 the show became \"The Gang Show\" and \"Crest of a Wave\" was performed for the first time, becoming over the years the anthem.\n\nIn 1937 the London show became the first amateur production to have a Royal Command Performance (an honour repeated in 1957 and 1964). A feature film called The Gang Show, starring Ralph Reader and The Gang, premièred at the Lyceum Theatre, London in April the same year, and in New York in December 1938.\n\nWhen the Gang Show started in London in 1932, Reader organised the cast as a Scout Troop; an arrangement which persists only in a few shows now. Members of the first troop wanted an identifying feature, deciding on a red scarf or necker. The red scarf has become a worldwide symbol, and to distinguish shows, an insignia in gold thread (UK: the initials GS in Reader's handwriting shot through with the show's name - AUS: usually a design related to the masks of comedy and tragedy and incorporating the show's name) is embroidered into the point of the scarf. Ralph Reader was originally called \"The Holborn Rover\" and was with the 4th Holborn Group whose scarf was half red and half green. Reader chose to have the gang show scarf red to be part of the 4th Holborn.\n\nMembers of shows in the United Kingdom used to only be allowed to wear the scarlet scarf if they were nationally recognised, i.e. they came up to prescribed minimum standards of performance and production. It is now worn by almost all Gang Shows, but shows still need to apply for National Recognition every 5 years in order to maintain standards.\n\nIn 1972, Reader founded the London Gang Show Fellowship so current and former members of the London show could keep in touch. Membership later expanded to anyone interested in Gang Show.\n\nSince the first in London, productions have been organised around the world, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. While individual in character, they share the ethos of Reader's concept and have common elements, often including a finale performance of \"Crest of a Wave\".\n\nIn 1958 Reader went to Chicago to produce and direct the first Gang Show in America. He returned to Chicago next year to guide the second. Reader first went to Chicago in 1920 as a teenager and began his stage career there.\n\nThe Glasgow Gang Show has, with few exceptions, run every year since April 1936. Peterborough Gang Show started in November 1937 and apart from the war years has run ever since. Harpenden Gang Show has performed every year since 1949, making it the longest continuously running Gang Show in the world. \n\nIn some countries an over 18 only show often referred to as a Bag Show are produced, often with a dinner and a more cabaret style and with more adult content such as risque jokes & burlesque elements. This is done for Rover Scouts and Leaders.\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia the Show Times came out of the strong theater culture of the area. These are smaller than the local Gang Show originally pulling form a single district to produce a show. Currently there are 4 of these shows Whitehorse Showtime, South Metro Showtime, Camberwell Showtime and Strzelecki Showtime. Because these showtimes are not Gangshows they do not have the red scarf instead choosing a different color such as Strzelecki Showtime's gold Scarf.\n\nOn the Crest of a Wave has become the signature tune throughout the world and is usually performed at the end. It may be sung as just the chorus (traditionally twice, the first time with gusto, the second part-quiet and staccato, part with gusto once more) but there are also two verses.\n\nA Touch of Silver (sometimes referred to as \"Silver on the Scarlet\"), written by Reader and Brisbane Gang Show producer Hugh \"Kirra\" McKee, is the signature tune of the Brisbane Gang Show and may be sung by any show that has performed for at least 25 seasons.\n\nRalph Reader\n\n\nWorld Wide Forum\n\nGlobal Gangshow\n\nHistory\n"}

While most people do not like being laughed at, there is a sub-group of people that exceedingly fear it, and without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in psychology, sociology, and psychiatry, and has been studied intensively.\n\nIn his clinical observations, found that some of his patients seemed to be primarily worried about being laughed at. They tended to scan their environment for signs of laughter and ridicule. Furthermore, they reported that they had the impression of being ridiculous themselves. Additionally, Titze observed a specific movement pattern among them when they thought they were being laughed at—awkward, wooden movements that resembled those of wooden puppets. He described this state as \"Pinocchio-syndrome\". \n\nTwo other behaviours related to laughter are gelotophilia, the joy of being laughed at, and katagelasticism, the joy of laughing at others.\n\nFrom the clinical observations a model of the causes and consequences of gelotophobia was drawn up so that the condition could be studied scientifically. The model claims that gelotophobia can be caused by any one of three things at different stages of development: \n\nThe putative causes of gelotophobia:\n\nThe consequences of gelotophobia:\nLater this model was revised and expanded.\n\nHere is a quick checklist of gelotophobic behaviours which suggest that people are gelotophobic:\n\nAnyone who displays or experiences at least half of these characteristics may be gelotophobic. Since laughter is used as an integral part of communication and how people form and maintain relationships, it is natural to see how those who tend to be gelotophobic will find that their social interactions are seriously affected.\n\nUsually laughter is contagious and leads to positive emotions such as exhilaration and joy, yet no one likes to be laughed at or made fun of. Most people dislike being laughed at to some degree and gelotophobia can range from having no fear at all, to borderline, to pronounced or extreme gelotophobia.\n\nThere is a fifteen-item questionnaire for the subjective assessment of gelotophobia, e.g. the GELOPH<15>. This questionnaire has been used to show that gelotophobia exists, to varying degrees, in a normal population. It has been found on every continent and has, so far, had samples taken from 72 countries and the GELOPH<15> has been translated into over 42 different languages. \n\nDifferent countries vary in the number of people within the population, who are gelotophobes. The sociologist Christie Davies predicts a higher prevalence of gelotophobia in hierarchically organized societies where the main means of social control is shame.\n\nResearch into gelotophobia using the GELOPH scales shows that empirically, the condition exists outside of people who seek therapy due to experiencing a problematic fear of being laughed at. In the first studies, gelotophobes were distinguished from other people with shame-based problems and non-shame based neurotics and samples of a normal population. Basically, this means that even though gelotophobia shares similar problems, high scores were also found for these criteria in individuals with Asperger's syndrome and Cluster A personality disorders.\n\nThe fear of being laughed at has also been studied among children and adolescents using modifications of these diagnostic instruments\n\nAlthough at face value the emotions relating to gelotophobia would be predominantly fear, there is a distinct interplay with three dominant emotions: low levels of joy, high levels of fear, and high levels of shame. More importantly, where shame in a typical week exceeds joy, gelotophobia is more likely to develop. Gelotophobes say that they are bad at regulating their emotions, and they more easily pick up the negative moods of other people. They also suppress expression of their emotions and do not share their feelings readily with others.\n\nGelotophobes do not have the ability to understand the difference between playful forms of humorous interactions such as teasing, and crueller forms such as ridicule. This means that even if someone is trying to be friendly and playful, a gelotophobe will feel apprehensive and mistake the interaction for ridicule. It can also mean that people may feel they are being bullied when in fact they are not. \n\nGelotophobes are often located in both the Eysenck PEN and the Big Five models of personality. Gelotophobia correlates highly with introversion and neuroticism, and on older P-scales, gelotophobes score higher in psychoticism. The dimensional assessment of personality pathology, a DSM personality disorder instrument, showed that those with a fear of being laughed at tend to be socially avoidant and submissive, as well as having identity problems. Social withdrawal and suspiciousness most frequently predicted gelotophobia.\n\nPaul Lewis (Boston College, US) speculated whether political gelotophobia might affect elections in the US (\"The twin fears of being effectively mocked or ineffective in mocking others [too harsh, blunt, tasteless] led candidates to aggressive and proactive strategies [going on TV to show they can take a joke, be funny—anything to avoid being rendered pathetically ridiculous or inappropriately derisive]\") [p. 42, conference abstract from the 2009 conference of the International Society for Humor Studies ISHS in Long Beach, California]; Sociologist Christie Davies, who is also president of the ISHS, comments satirically on the results of recent elections in the UK. He noticed that losers in those elections were frequently bald—\"To be bald is to suffer from gelotophobia, to fear being laughed at; to fear being laughed at is to fear disorder; to fear disorder is to embrace absolutism\".\n\nA number of tests show that gelotophobes often underestimate their own potential and achievements. Gelotophobes tend to see themselves as less virtuous than people who know them. Similarly, in an intelligence study, gelotophobes consistently underestimated their intellectual performance by as much as 6 IQ points. Gelotophobes have a different experience of laughter: it does not lift their mood or make them more cheerful. They personally characterise their own humour as being inept, yet once again, tests show that they are no different from other people at making witty remarks and humour.\n\n\n\n"}

Born in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse, would meet.\n\nIn 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\", written in the voice of Alice B. Toklas, her life partner and an American-born member of the Parisian avant-garde. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\" and \"there is no there there\", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland, California.\n\nHer books include \"Q.E.D.\" (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's friends, \"Fernhurst\", a fictional story about a love triangle, \"Three Lives\" (1905–06), and \"The Making of Americans\" (1902–1911). In \"Tender Buttons\" (1914), Stein commented on lesbian sexuality.\n\nHer activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Faÿ. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader Marshal Pétain. Some have argued that certain accounts of Stein's wartime activities have amounted to a \"witch hunt\".\n\nStein, the youngest of a family of five children, was born on February 3, 1874, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (which merged with Pittsburgh in 1907), to upper-middle-class Jewish parents, Daniel and Amelia Stein. Her father was a wealthy businessman with real estate holdings. German and English were spoken in their home.\n\nWhen Stein was three years old, she and her family moved to Vienna, and then Paris. Accompanied by governesses and tutors, the Steins endeavored to imbue their children with the cultured sensibilities of European history and life. After a year-long sojourn abroad, they returned to America in 1878, settling in Oakland, California, where her father became director of San Francisco's street car lines, the Market Street Railway, in an era when public transportation was a privately owned enterprise. Stein attended First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland's Sabbath school. During their residence in Oakland, they lived for four years on a ten-acre lot, and Stein built many memories of California there. She would often go on excursions with her brother, Leo, with whom she developed a close relationship. Stein found formal schooling in Oakland unstimulating, but she read often: Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Scott, Burns, Smollett, Fielding, and more.\n\nWhen Stein was 14 years old, her mother died. Three years later, her father died as well. Stein's eldest brother, Michael Stein, then took over the family business holdings and in 1892 arranged for Gertrude and another sister, Bertha, to live with their mother's family in Baltimore. Here she lived with her uncle David Bachrach, who in 1877 had married Gertrude's maternal aunt, Fanny Keyser.\n\nIn Baltimore, Stein met Claribel and Etta Cone, who held Saturday evening salons that she would later emulate in Paris. The Cones shared an appreciation for art and conversation about it and modeled a domestic division of labor that Stein would replicate in her relationship with Alice B. Toklas.\n\nStein attended Radcliffe College, then an annex of Harvard University, from 1893 to 1897 and was a student of psychologist William James. With James's supervision, Stein and another student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on \"normal motor automatism\", a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking.\n\nThese experiments yielded examples of writing that appeared to represent \"stream of consciousness\", a psychological theory often attributed to James and the style of modernist authors Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. In 1934, behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner interpreted Stein's difficult poem \"Tender Buttons\" as an example of \"normal motor automatism\". In a letter Stein wrote during the 1930s, she explained that she never accepted the theory of automatic writing: \"[T]here can be automatic movements, but not automatic writing. Writing for the normal person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically.\" She did publish an article in a psychological journal on \"spontaneous automatic writing\" while at Radcliffe, but \"the unconscious and the intuition (even when James himself wrote about them) never concerned her.\"\n\nAt Radcliffe, she began a lifelong friendship with Mabel Foote Weeks, whose correspondence traces much of the progression of Stein's life. In 1897, Stein spent the summer in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, studying embryology at the Marine Biological Laboratory. She received her A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) magna cum laude from Radcliffe in 1898.\n\nWilliam James, who had become a committed mentor to Stein at Radcliffe, recognizing her intellectual potential, and declaring her his \"most brilliant woman student\", encouraged Stein to enroll in medical school. Although Stein professed no interest in either the theory or practice of medicine, she enrolled at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1897. In her fourth year, Stein failed an important course, lost interest, and left. Ultimately, medical school had bored her, and she had spent many of her evenings not applying herself to her studies, but taking long walks and attending the opera.\n\nStein's tenure at Johns Hopkins was marked by challenge and stress. Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in \"Things As They Are\", 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as \"Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn\". According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's \"controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty\" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.\n\nAsked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled \"The Value of College Education for Women\", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:\n\nWhile a student at Johns Hopkins and purportedly still naïve about sexual matters, Stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality. Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with Mary Bookstaver who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her \"erotic awakening\". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies. In 1902 Stein's brother Leo Stein left for London, and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.\n\nFrom 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the Luxembourg Garden on the Left Bank of Paris in a two-story apartment (with adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at 27 rue de Fleurus, 6th arrondissement. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.\n\nThe gallery space was furnished with imposing Renaissance-era furniture manufactured in Florence, Italy. The paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling. Initially illuminated by gaslight, the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to World War I.\n\nLeo Stein cultivated important art world connections, enabling the Stein holdings to grow over time. The art historian and collector Bernard Berenson hosted Gertrude and Leo in his English country house in 1902, facilitating their introduction to Paul Cézanne and the dealer Ambroise Vollard. Vollard was heavily involved in the Cézanne art market, and he was the first important contact in the Paris art world for both Leo and Gertrude.\n\nThe joint collection of Gertrude and Leo Stein began in late 1904 when Michael Stein announced that their trust account had accumulated a balance of 8,000 francs. They spent this at Vollard's Gallery, buying Gauguin's \"Sunflowers\" and \"Three Tahitians\", Cézanne's \"Bathers\", and two Renoirs.\nThe art collection increased and the walls at Rue de Fleurus were rearranged continually to make way for new acquisitions. In \"the first half of 1905\" the Steins acquired Cézanne's \"Portrait of Mme Cézanne\" and Delacroix's \"Perseus and Andromeda\". Shortly after the opening of the Salon d'Automne of 1905 (on October 18, 1905), the Steins acquired Matisse's \"Woman with a Hat\" and Picasso's \"Young Girl with Basket of Flowers\".\n\nHenry McBride (art critic for the \"New York Sun\") did much for Stein's reputation in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure. Of the art collection at 27 Rue de Fleurus, McBride commented: \"[I]n proportion to its size and quality... [it is] just about the most potent of any that I have ever heard of in history.\" McBride also made the observation that Gertrude \"collected geniuses rather than masterpieces. She recognized them a long way off.\"\n\nBy early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein's studio had many paintings by Henri Manguin, Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Honoré Daumier, Henri Matisse, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Their collection was representative of two famous art exhibitions that took place during their residence together in Paris, and to which they contributed, either by lending their art, or by patronizing the featured artists. The Steins' elder brother, Michael, and sister-in-law Sarah (Sally) acquired a large number of Henri Matisse paintings; Gertrude's friends from Baltimore, Claribel and Etta Cone, collected similarly, eventually donating their art collection, virtually intact, to the Baltimore Museum of Art.\n\nWhile numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 Rue de Fleurus. Where Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude's collection, the collection of Michael and Sarah Stein emphasized Matisse. In April 1914 Leo relocated to Settignano, Italy, near Florence, and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:\n\nLeo departed with sixteen Renoirs, and relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to Cézanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist's works with his sister, taking with him only a Cézanne painting of \"5 apples\". The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after World War I, and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again. The Steins' holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.\nAfter Stein's and Leo's households separated in 1914, she continued to collect examples of Picasso's art, which had turned to Cubism, a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude's remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and Juan Gris, most of her other pictures having been sold.\n\nGertrude Stein's personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, \"[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th century painting in the world.\" After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of Juan Gris, André Masson, and Sir Francis Rose. In 1932, Stein asserted: \"painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art.\"\n\nIn 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter Francisco Riba Rovira (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what Cézanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.\n\nThe only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which Cézanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.\n\nThe gatherings in the Stein home \"brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art\". Dedicated attendees included Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Gavin Williamson, Thornton Wilder, Sherwood Anderson, Francis Cyril Rose, Bob Brown, René Crevel, Élisabeth de Gramont, Francis Picabia, Claribel Cone, Mildred Aldrich, Jane Peterson, Carl Van Vechten and Henri Matisse. Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors. It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.\n\nGertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of Cézanne: \"Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"\n\nAmong Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: Fernande Olivier (Picasso's mistress), Georges Braque (artist), André Derain (artist), Max Jacob (poet), Guillaume Apollinaire (poet), Marie Laurencin (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), Henri Rousseau (painter), and Joseph Stella.\n\nHemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway \"yellow\" in \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.\" Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child. While Stein has been credited with inventing the term \"Lost Generation\" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.\n\nDuring the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer Paul Bowles to go to Tangier, where she and Alice had vacationed.\n\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by \"The Making of Americans: The Hersland Family\"; popularized writing such as \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\"; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which \"Brewsie and Willie\" is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, libretti and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in Oakland, \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"\n\nThese stream-of-consciousness experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as Cubism, plasticity, and collage. Many of the experimental works such as \"Tender Buttons\" have since been interpreted by critics as a feminist reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"automatic writing\" with William James, she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.\n\nThough Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of Cézanne. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\" (p. 8). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"\n\nHer use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in \"The Making of Americans\" where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgement is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.\n\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the emotional manipulation that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses \"play\".\" In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must \"\"inster\"stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\" In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\"; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of \"The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook\", which was written by Toklas.\n\nSeveral of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including Virgil Thomson's operas \"Four Saints in Three Acts\" and \"The Mother of Us All\", and James Tenney's setting of \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\" as a canon dedicated to Philip Corner, beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"\n\nWhile living in Paris, Stein began submitting her writing for publication. Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was \"Three Lives\". In 1911, Mildred Aldrich introduced Stein to Mabel Dodge Luhan and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.\n\nMabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication \"The Makings of Americans\" and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of \"Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia\". Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the 69th Regiment Armory Show in 1913, \"the first avant-garde art exhibition in America\".\n\nIn addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in \"Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose\", published in a special March 1913 publication of \"Arts and Decoration\". Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in \"Speculations\":\n\nStein and Carl Van Vechten, the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was \"Papa Woojums\", and Stein, \"Baby Woojums\". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.\n\nIn October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in Times Square announced to all that \"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived\". Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.\n\nStein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that \"Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.\" Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a speech disorder, palilalia, which caused her \"to stutter over words and phrases\". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who had the ability to hold listeners with the \"musicality of her language\".\n\nIn Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. In Beverly Hills, California, she visited actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her. Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from Random House, who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works. The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" wrote after Stein's return to Paris: \"No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed.\"\n\nStein completed \"Q.E.D.\", her first novel, on October 24, 1903. One of the earliest coming out stories, it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and Mary Bookstaver, and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. \n\nIn 1904 Stein began \"Fernhurst\", a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean (M. Carey Thomas), a faculty member from Bryn Mawr College (Mary Gwinn) and a Harvard graduate (Alfred Hodder). Mellow asserts that \"Fernhurst\" \"is a decidedly minor and awkward piece of writing\". It includes some commentary that Gertrude mentioned in her autobiography when she discussed the \"fateful twenty-ninth year\" during which:\n\nMellow observes that, in 1904, 30-year-old Gertrude \"had evidently determined that the 'small hard reality' of her life would be writing\".\n\nStein attributed the inception of \"Three Lives\" to the inspiration she received from a portrait Cézanne had painted of his wife and which was in the Stein collection. She credited this as a revelatory moment in the evolution of her writing style. Stein described:\n\nShe began \"Three Lives\" during the spring of 1905 and finished it the following year.\n\nGertrude Stein stated the date for her writing of \"The Making of Americans\" was 1906–8. Her biographer has uncovered evidence that it actually began in 1902 and did not end until 1911. Stein compared her work to James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and to Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\". Her critics were less enthusiastic about it. Stein wrote the bulk of the novel between 1903 and 1911, and evidence from her manuscripts suggests three major periods of revision during that time. The manuscript remained mostly hidden from public view until 1924 when, at the urging of Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford agreed to publish excerpts in the \"transatlantic review\". In 1925, the Paris-based Contact Press published a limited run of the novel consisting of 500 copies. A much-abridged edition was published by Harcourt Brace in 1934, but the full version remained out of print until Something Else Press republished it in 1966. In 1995, a new, definitive edition was published by Dalkey Archive Press with a foreword by William Gass.\n\nGertrude's \"Matisse\" and \"Picasso\" descriptive essays appeared in Alfred Stieglitz's August, 1912 edition of \"Camera Work\", a special edition devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her very first publication. Of this publication, Gertrude said, \"[h]e was the first one that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that meant to me or to any one.\"\n\nStein's descriptive essays apparently began with her essay of Alice B. Toklas, \"a little prose vignette, a kind of happy inspiration that had detached itself from the torrential prose of \"The Making of Americans\"\". Stein's early efforts at word portraits are catalogued in and under individual's names in Kellner, 1988. Matisse and Picasso were subjects of early essays, later collected and published in \"Geography and Plays\" and \"Portraits and Prayers\".\n\nHer subjects included several ultimately famous personages, and her subjects provided a description of what she observed in her Saturday salons at 27 Rue de Fleurus: \"Ada\" (Alice B. Toklas), \"Two Women\" (The Cone sisters, Claribel Cone and Etta Cone), \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" (Ethel Mars and Maud Hunt Squire), \"Men\" (Hutchins Hapgood, Peter David Edstrom, Maurice Sterne), \"Matisse\" (1909, Henri Matisse), \"Picasso\" (1909, Pablo Picasso), \"Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia\" (1911, Mabel Dodge Luhan), and \"Guillaume Apollinaire\" (1913).\n\n\"Tender Buttons\" is the best known of Stein's \"hermetic\" works. It is a small book separated into three sections—\"Food, Objects and Rooms\", each containing prose under subtitles. Its publication in 1914 caused a great dispute between Mabel Dodge Luhan and Stein, because Mabel had been working to have it published by another publisher. Mabel wrote at length about what she viewed as the bad choice of publishing it with the press Gertrude selected. Evans wrote Gertrude:\n\nStein ignored Mabel's exhortations, and eventually Mabel, and published 1,000 copies of the book, in 1914. An antiquarian copy was valued at over $1,200 in 2007. It is currently in print, and was re-released as \"Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition\" by City Lights Publishers in March 2014.\n\nIn an interview with in \"A Transatlantic Interview - 1946\", Stein insisted that this work was completely \"realistic\" in the tradition of Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: \"I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen.\" Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the \"reference\" of objects remained central to her work, although the \"representation\" of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that \"[u]nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know.\"\n\nStein met her life partner Alice B. Toklas on September 8, 1907, on Toklas's first day in Paris, at Sarah and Michael Stein's apartment. On meeting Stein, Toklas wrote:\n\nSoon thereafter, Stein introduced Toklas to Pablo Picasso at his studio, where he was at work on \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\".\n\nIn 1908, they summered in Fiesole, Italy, Toklas staying with Harriet Lane Levy, the companion of her trip from the United States, and her housemate until Alice moved in with Stein and Leo in 1910. That summer, Stein stayed with Michael and Sarah Stein, their son Allan, and Leo in a nearby villa. Gertrude and Alice's summer of 1908 is memorialized in images of the two of them in Venice, at the piazza in front of Saint Mark's.\n\nToklas arrived in 1907 with Harriet Levy, with Toklas maintaining living arrangements with Levy until she moved to 27 Rue de Fleurus in 1910. In an essay written at the time, Stein humorously discussed the complex efforts, involving much letter writing and Victorian niceties, to extricate Levy from Toklas's living arrangements. In \"Harriet\", Stein considers Levy's nonexistent plans for the summer, following her nonexistent plans for the winter:\n\nDuring the early summer of 1914, Gertrude bought three paintings by Juan Gris: \"Roses\", \"Glass and Bottle\", and \"Book and Glasses\". Soon after she purchased them from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's gallery, the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of \"Three Lives\", to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17. When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting Alfred North Whitehead in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.\n\nWith money acquired from the sale of Stein's last Matisse \"Woman with a Hat\" to her brother Michael, she and Toklas vacationed in Spain from May 1915 through the spring of 1916. During their interlude in Majorca, Spain, Gertrude continued her correspondence with Mildred Aldrich who kept her apprised of the War's progression, and eventually inspired Gertrude and Alice to return to France to join the war effort.\n\nToklas and Stein returned to Paris in June 1916, and acquired a Ford automobile with the help of associates in the United States; Gertrude learned to drive it with the help of her friend William Edwards Cook. Gertrude and Alice then volunteered to drive supplies to French hospitals, in the Ford they named \"Auntie\", \"after Gertrude's aunt Pauline, 'who always behaved admirably in emergencies and behaved fairly well most times if she was flattered.'\"\nDuring the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.\" She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the Ain district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the Rhône-Alpes. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named \"Basket\" whose successor, \"Basket II\", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, Ain, in the Rhône-Alpes region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to Bernard Faÿ who was a collaborator with the Vichy regime and had connections to the Gestapo, or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book \"Wars I Have Seen\" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to Keystone cops. When Faÿ was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Faÿ's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of \"Life\" magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in Berchtesgaden. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: \"Off We All Went To See Germany.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in the Yale University Beinecke Library, which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was \"Baby Precious\", in turn Stein was for Toklas, \"Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle\".\n\nStein is the author of one of the earliest coming out stories, \"Q.E.D.\" (published in 1950 as \"Things as They Are\"), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of romantic friendship as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested \"passion in its many disguised forms\". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with Mary Bookstaver (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.\n\nStein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of Otto Weininger's \"Sex and Character\" (1906). Weininger, though Jewish by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.\n\nMore positive affirmations of Stein's sexuality began with her relationship with Alice B. Toklas. Ernest Hemingway describes how Alice was Gertrude's \"wife\" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two \"wives\" to chat.\n\nThe more affirming essay \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" is one of the first homosexual revelation stories to be published. The work, like \"Q.E.D.\", is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community, though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars. The work contains the word \"gay\" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word \"gay\" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them, and, thus, uninformed readers missed the lesbian content. A similar essay of homosexual men begins more obviously with the line \"Sometimes men are kissing\" but is less well known.\n\nIn \"\" Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with \"highly condensed layers of public and private meanings\" created by wordplay including puns on the words \"box\", \"cow\", and in titles such as \"tender buttons\".\n\nAlong with Stein's widely known \"A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\" quotation, \"there is no there there\" is also one of her most famous. It appears in \"Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography\" (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). She wrote:\n\nAccording to Janet Malcolm's contested account in \"Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice\", Stein was a vocal critic of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal.\n\nWhile some have stressed her queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics, her statements on immigration include sentiments that would be considered racist today. In a 1934 interview published in \"The New York Times\" she stated: That is the reason why I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant. \n\nShe publicly endorsed General Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War and admired Vichy leader Marshal Philippe Pétain. Some have argued for a more nuanced view of Stein's collaborationist activity, arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France. Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky: \"There is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing.\"\n\nWhile identified with the modernist movements in art and literature, Stein's political affiliations were a mix of reactionary and progressive ideas. She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the industrial revolution had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary Ancien Régime. At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal. Her last major work was the libretto of the feminist opera \"The Mother of Us All\" (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, \"Brewsie and Willie\" (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.\n\nA compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful Vichy government official Bernard Faÿ. Stein had met Faÿ in 1926, and he became her \"dearest friend during her life\", according to Alice B. Toklas. Faÿ had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933–34 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\". Faÿ's influence was instrumental in avoiding Nazi confiscation of Stein's historically significant and monetarily valuable collection of artwork, which throughout the war years was housed in Stein's Paris rue Christine apartment, under locked safeguard.\n\nIn 1941, at Faÿ's suggestion, Stein consented to translate into English some 180 pages of speeches made by Marshal Philippe Pétain. In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between George Washington and Pétain. She writes of the high esteem in which Pétain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler. Conceived and targeted for an American readership, Stein's translations were ultimately never published in the United States. Random House publisher Bennett Cerf had read the introduction Stein had written for the translations and been horrified by what she had produced.\n\nAlthough Jewish, Stein collaborated with Vichy France, a regime that deported more than 75,000 Jews to Nazi concentration camps, of whom only 3 percent survived the Holocaust. In 1944, Stein wrote that Petain's policies were \"really wonderful so simple so natural so extraordinary\". This was Stein's contention in the year when the town of Culoz, where she and Toklas resided, saw the removal of its Jewish children to Auschwitz. It is difficult to say, however, how aware Stein was of these events. As she wrote in \"Wars I Have Seen\", \"However near a war is it is always not very near. Even when it is here.\" Stein had stopped translating Petain's speeches three years previously, in 1941.\n\nStein was able to condemn the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor while simultaneously maintaining the dissonant acceptance of Hitler as conqueror of Europe. Journalist Lanning Warren interviewed Stein in her Paris apartment in a piece published in \"The New York Times Magazine\" on May 6, 1934. Stein, seemingly ironically, proclaimed that Hitler merited the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nGiven that after the war Stein commented that the only way to ensure world peace was to teach the Germans disobedience, this 1934 Stein interview has come to be interpreted as an ironic jest made by a practiced iconoclast hoping to gain attention and provoke controversy. In an effort to correct popular mainstream misrepresentations of Stein's wartime activity, a dossier of articles by critics and historians has been gathered for the online journal Jacket2.\n\nHow much of Stein's wartime activities were motivated by the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to Pétain may have gone beyond expedience. She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do so. Accustomed to a life of entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the \"Atlantic Monthly\" in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: \"it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food.\" Stein continued to praise Pétain after the war ended, this at a time when Pétain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.\n\nAuthor Djuna Barnes provided a caustic assessment of Stein's book, \"Wars I Have Seen\":\n\nOthers have argued that some of the accounts of Stein's war time activities have amounted to a \"witch hunt\".\n\nStein died on July 27, 1946 at the age of 72 after surgery for stomach cancer at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine. She was interred in Paris in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Later Alice B. Toklas was buried alongside her. According to the famous version of her last moments, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: \"What is the answer?\" After Toklas replied to Stein that there was no answer, Stein countered by sinking back into her bed, murmuring: \"Then, there is no question!\"\n\nHer companion Toklas, however, has given two other versions of the encounter—neither of which agrees with the \"canonical\" version above. Writing in the June 2005 edition of \"The New Yorker\", Janet Malcolm describes:\n\nSherwood Anderson in his public introduction to Stein's 1922 publication of \"Geography and Plays\" wrote:\nIn a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, \"As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.\"\n\nOther critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p. IX) defines \"Steinese\" as \"gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation\".\n\nComposer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" in \"L'Histoire du Soldat\" to Gertrude Stein's in \"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\" (1922), specifically: \"[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday.\" He writes that the \"effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.\n\nJames Thurber wrote:\nAuthor Katherine Ann Porter provided her own estimation of Stein's literary legacy: \"Wise or silly or nothing at all, down everything goes on the page with an air of everything being equal, unimportant in itself important because it happened to her and she was writing about it.\"\n\nHistory Professor Blanche Wiesen Cook, has written of Stein: \"She was not a radical feminist. She was Jewish and anti-Semitic, lesbian and contemptuous of women, ignorant about economics and hostile to socialism.\"\n\nWriting for \"Vanity Fair\" magazine in 1923, eminent literary critic Edmund Wilson presciently came to an evaluation similar to the one made by Katharine Ann Porter some twenty years later, after Stein's death. Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way Cubists manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the plastic arts, literature deals with\n\nAn elevated observer, perched high above everything below, he likened Stein to a self-conceived \"Buddha...registering impressions like some august seismograph\".\n\nStein's literary output was a subject of amusement for her brother Leo Stein, who characterized her writing as an \"abomination\". Later detractors of Stein's work deemed her experimentation as the serendipitous result of her alleged inability to communicate through linguistic convention, deficient in the skills required \"to deal effectively with language, so that she made her greatest weakness into her most remarkable strength\".\n\nStein has been the subject of many artistic works. \nStein and Toklas merit their own line each in the song \"Bosom Buddies\" from the 1966 Broadway musical \"MAME\", based on the stage play \"Auntie Mame\", by composer-lyricist Jerry Herman. In \"MAME\", Vera Charles, Mame Dennis' actress-confidante pal, sings: \"...I'll always be Alice Toklas, if you'll be Gertrude Stein.\" (Bea Arthur, who played the original Vera Charles on Broadway, recreated the same role for the 1974 film version of the musical.)\nIn the 1998 Latin American literary classic \"Yo-Yo Boing!\", novelist Giannina Braschi pays homage to Stein as an imaginary mentor.\n\nIn 2005, playwright/actor Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Stein in the solo musical \"ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1\" at Princeton University. In 2006, theatre director/actor Luiz Päetow created his solo, \"Plays\", portraying Stein's 1934 homonymous lecture, and toured Brazil for several years. \"Loving Repeating\" is a musical by Stephen Flaherty based on the writings of Gertrude Stein. Stein and Alice B. Toklas are both characters in the eight person show. \nStein is a central character in Nick Bertozzi's 2007 graphic novel \"The Salon\".\n\nThe posthumously published \"Journals of Ayn Rand\" contain several highly hostile references to Gertrude Stein. From Rand's working notes for her novel \"The Fountainhead\", it is clear that the character Lois Cook in that book was intended as a caricature of Stein.\n\nStein (played by Bernard Cribbins) and Toklas (played by Wilfrid Brambell) were depicted in the playful Swedish 1978 absurdist fiction film \"Picassos äventyr\" \"(The Adventures of Picasso)\" by director Tage Danielsson, with Gösta Ekman as Picasso.\n\nStein was portrayed in the 2011 Woody Allen film \"Midnight in Paris\" by Kathy Bates, and by Tracee Chimo in the 2018 season of the television series \"Genius\" which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.\n\nStein is added to a list of great artists and notables in the popular Broadway musical \"Rent\" in the song \"La Vie Boheme\".\nShe is also mentioned in the Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers 1935 film \"Top Hat\" and in the song \"Roseability\" by the Scottish rock group Idlewild.\n\nComposer Ricky Ian Gordon and librettist Royce Vavrek's opera \"27\" about Stein and Toklas premiered at Opera Theatre of St. Louis in June, 2014 with Stephanie Blythe as Stein.\n\nEdward Einhorn wrote the play \"The Marriage of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein\", a farce about their fantasy marriage that also told the story of their life. It premiered in May 2017 at HERE Arts Center in New York.\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest hand-written hymnals are from the Middle Ages in the context of European Christianity, although individual hymns such as the Te Deum go back much further. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, together with the growing popularity of moveable type, quickly made hymnals a standard feature of Christian worship in all major denominations of Western and Central Europe. The first hymnal of the Reformation was \"Achtliederbuch\", followed by the \"Erfurt Enchiridion\". An important hymnal of the 17th century was \"Praxis pietatis melica\".\n\n\n"}

He is well-known around the world as the creator of a music method: \"Kodály method\". Foreign musicians from all over the world come to see his birthplace, \"Kecskemét\" to get some inspiration, learn his method for a better pedagogy and listen to Hungarian choirs and concerts. These are the main points for musicians to visit \"Kecskemét, Bács-Kiskun county\".\n\n1970 was the year when the name and the event was born. \"Zoltán Kodály\"\"’s widow\" and the primary and secondary Kodály school’s director, \"Márta\" \"Nemesszeghyné Szentkirályi\" had an idea about an international summer course. For their initiation the city advertised this course for learning the Hungarian music teaching in schools and the method’s basics. A lot of people interested in this course, so after two years the International Kodály Seminar was held again, second time. The first was in 1970 and the second, two years later, in 1972.\n\nSince 1975, \"the Kodály Institute of the Liszt Ferenc Academy\" was active, they started organising the third Kodály Seminar. /The Seminar is organized every second year. An International Music Festival is also held at the same time./ While the first two courses’ main goal was for foreign professional musicians and was about the school teaching in music schools, since 1975 there was a big change, because they wanted to make the courses interesting for the Hungarian pedagogues too.\n\nTheir programmes, variations of opportunities was also motivating for the Hungarian audience. The aim of the Kodály Seminars was that: refreshing the possibilities, abilities to help the music teachers, conductors in their daily work. Kodály Seminar became year by year a voluntary self-education course; how to be a “good musician” and the human and professional music symbol.\n\nNowadays the aim of these courses is the comprehensive demonstration of the Hungarian music education in practical and pedagogical works, Kodály’s and Bartók’s lifework. The programme consists of daily conducting lessons, solfege lessons, methodology classes, choral singing and concerts.\n\nIn 1987 with the Seminar the International Kodály Symposium was held; a new summer programme started. Workshops were in different topics: folk music, music analysis.\n\nThe 20th International Kodály Seminar was held in 1999 which was the Jubilee of the tradition since 1970.\n\nThere have been approximately 2200 participants from 42 different countries during the Seminars.\n\nIn this year (17-28 July 2017) will be the 29th International Kodaly Seminar with a lot of programmes and concerts.\n\n"}

It is also an informal term for the actress who plays a secondary lead, usually a love interest, to the leading actor in a film or play. \n\nA leading lady can also be an actress of renown. For example, Lynn Fontanne and Helen Hayes were both referred to as the \"leading lady of the theatre\" in their time. Similarly, Mary Pickford was called the \"leading lady\" of the cinema.\n\nThe term has been applied to an actress who is often associated with one particular actor. For example, Olivia de Havilland was Errol Flynn's leading lady in several films, Katharine Hepburn had a similar association with Spencer Tracy, Lauren Bacall with Humphrey Bogart, and Maureen O'Hara with John Wayne. A leading lady is also an actress who is typecast in romantic supporting roles.\n\nThe term can also be used collectively; for example, the phrase \"Hollywood's leading ladies\" can be used to refer to a group of notable, famous, or popular actresses.\n\nMany modern day leading ladies includes: Jennifer Aniston, Patricia Arquette, Angela Bassett, Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Claire Danes, Viola Davis, Gal Gadot, Mariska Hargitay, Katherine Heigl, Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson, Mindy Kaling, Anna Kendrick, Nicole Kidman, Jessica Lange, Jennifer Lawrence, Blake Lively, Jennifer Lopez, Melissa McCarthy, Eva Mendes, Julianne Moore, Elisabeth Moss, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Amy Poehler, Rihanna, Julia Roberts, Margot Robbie, Zoe Saldana, Hailee Steinfeld, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, Emma Watson, Rebel Wilson, Kate Winslet, Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara.\n\n"}
{"id": "30610177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30610177", "title": "List of Conan sketches", "text": "List of Conan sketches\n\nThe following is a list of recurring sketches and characters which debuted on \"Conan\" on TBS. \"Conan\" is a talk/variety show starring Conan O'Brien and sidekick Andy Richter. Writers Deon Cole, Brian Stack, Andres du Bouchet, Dan Cronin, and members of The Basic Cable Band (especially Richie \"LaBamba\" Rosenberg), as well as propmaster Bill Tull, often appear in sketches as well. Some sketches feature celebrity cameos.\n\nThe classic \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" characters The Interrupter, The Masturbating Bear and Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog have made appearances on \"Conan\". In some cases, due to complaints, the Masturbating Bear is referred to by an alternate name, \"The Self-Pleasuring Panda.\"\n\nA hybrid of Dr. Phil McGraw and Punxsutawney Phil, this puppet talk show host groundhog first appeared after Groundhog Day in 2014. He appears as a groundhog with a bald head, Dr. Phil-style eyes, and a mustache. After dispensing nonsensical relationship advice and theories about certain things, such as the mafia being responsible for celebrity relationships ending, Punxsutawney Dr. Phil then accuses Conan, who always criticizes him, of various false issues, such as prostitution, alcoholism, and cocaine addiction, using cut-together voice clips from the actual Dr. Phil Show. Conan is stunned by the accusation, strongly denying it, but Andy confirms it, much to his chagrin. Punxsutawney Dr. Phil then promises to help Conan with his anger problems, prompting Conan to ask what will happen if he refuses to take his help. Punxsutawney Dr. Phil responds \"Then I will kill you,\" while brandishing a switchblade knife. Then after going back into the grass, Conan ends the sketch saying to catch the Punxsutawney Dr. Phil Show weekdays at 4:00. \n\nConan and Bruce Timm created The Flaming C, a character based on Conan's appearance and jokingly referred to it as DC Comics' next superhero. The character has a comical appearance due to wearing things not associated with superheroes, such as a steaming ovenmit, a jai alai glove, ski goggles, a Star of David patch, socks with garters, fishnet stockings and loafers. Faux videos have been made where the character appears on the show \"Young Justice\". Conan also played a faux trailer for an animated feature film about the character. The character also had a dedicated segment at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International. Conan later brought in a lifesize Lego statue of the character made by a viewer. On Conan's Clueless Gamer segment, he played as the Flaming C in \"\". After the 2015 Comic-Con, it was turned into a weekly series on the show.\n\nA man (Eddie Pepitone) stands up and angrily yells at Conan in response to jokes in the monologue. He always dies of a heart attack at the end of the skit.\n\nConan mentions his favorite part of basketball is the dunking mascots at halftime. He then introduces us to some weird mascots who should never compete in a slam dunk contest. As he lists them, a guy dressed as that mascot attempts to dunk the ball, usually resulting in failure. Some of these mascots include: The Solar System, Cop at a urinal, Congressman Anthony Weiner's underpants, and the Human Starfish. As of November 17, 2011, only 3 mascots have completed this feat successfully.\n\nTimed for the Christmas season, Minty is a giant candy cane (originally played by Brian McCann, and replaced by Deon Cole after McCann left the show; the lyrics to his theme song changed after Cole replaced McCann.) who walks through the crowd throwing mini candy canes to the audience members as a 1940s crooner-style jingle plays in the background. According to the jingle, he fell on the ground for \"just a moment or two\", which was enough for him to be covered in \"excrement\". Actually, his costume is covered in the typical kind of garbage that might be found on a dirty floor, such as dead bugs, hair, a penny and a cigarette butt. One loyal fan created a video game based on the character, which was posted to the show's website.\n\nTBS founder Ted Turner, played by Will Forte, appears on a stuffed buffalo named Teddy Jr. to harshly criticize Conan and his audience and claiming the show will ruin the reputation of TBS. Conan eventually brought out his own buffalo and challenged Turner to a duel but the buffaloes instead began mating, with Teddy Jr. being the \"receiver\".\n\nWikibear is a talking teddy bear (voice by Brian Stack) that is meant to answer any question by connecting to Wikipedia via a Bluetooth connection. After correctly doing so, it will talk about topics that are extremely inappropriate for children, i.e. terminal diseases, famine, natural disasters, cannibalism, mass violence, serial killers, war battles, deadly animals, and death. Conan always points out these facts, and says a software overhaul should fix the problems, but Wikibear proves that claim to be false by continuing to do so.\n\nWikibear's incorrect claim that Al Capone died of syphilis was challenged by a viewer on a Fan Corrections segment, who stated he actually died of cardiac arrest. Conan supported Wikibear's statement with fake archived video of Capone's private physician affirming the false cause of death.\n\nWhen Conan mentions an actor has been picked for a new superhero role or an athlete has signed with a new team, an elderly Japanese man with poor English in the audience tries to tell Conan why he would have been better for the job, usually wearing an outfit to match.\n\nAt the show's visit to 2016 Comic Con in San Diego, Conan introduced Comic Khan (Andres du Bouchet), the \"Star Trek\" villain, now a stand up comedian, whose jokes are all insults directed towards Captain Kirk and his own weight gain. He returned in 2017.\n\nConan shows clips of \"Jeopardy!\" host Alex Trebek reading nonsensical clues of which contestants cannot answer, all the while questioning the long-time host's mental state. The clips are actually spliced from several different clues to form one bizarre giant clue. Trebek later appeared in a cameo and did the same to Conan, and left by saying a bizarre statement in person.\n\nAndy previews some fake news stories he's working on for the next week complete with fake previews or stock footage, all of which are ridiculous.\n\nAndy hosts what seems like a traditional sports show, but instead gives off the impression that he has no clue about sports and is very ill-prepared. Examples of this would be when he goes over the week's NFL games and picks the winners based on a real life matchup, (Redskins vs. Cowboys, he picks the Cowboys because he's seen enough western movies to know how it turns out.) and the Clip of the Week in which he shows a clip that has nothing to do with sports. He also takes questions from viewers who criticize his ignorance, and answers them with only \"Good question, [viewer's name].\" Richter is also very repetitive in this sketch, as in this introduction: \"Welcome to Andy Richter's Sports Blast. I'm Andy Richter, and this is Sports Blast!\"\n\nConan shows audience members along with bizarre (fake) Craigslist ads they have posted, in the categories man seeking woman/woman seeking man/missed connections, job offers/seeking work and for sale/wanted to buy. The ads are usually embarrassing or perverted.\n\nPropmaster Bill Tull gives examples of how to make holiday decorations and gifts out of things found around the house. Tips are always the form of \"Take a..., add a..., BOOM!...\" Example: \"Take a piece of red tape, tape it to a pine cone; BOOM!, Christmas ornament.\" Between tips, Conan often makes faces of displeasure that more tips are coming, before indicating that another will come.\n\nConan plays \"Name That Tune\" with the audience, except that the songs are re-written as sound-alikes with alternate lyrics so the show would not have to pay royalties and avoid being sued for copyright infringement, and the contestants have to guess what the original song was. The songs are sung by homeless lounge singer Brian LaFontaine (Brian Stack), whom Conan frequently expresses his contempt for.\n\nConan mentions that 10,000 baby boomers retire a day, and shows actual YouTube videos of how some who recently have are spending all of their free time now, which involve them doing things much younger people would do, including gymnastics, trying new dance moves, and racing go-carts in the street.\n\nConan talks about the site BuzzFeed, best known for its unusual lists. Conan claims that the site is running out of ideas for lists and he even tries to prove this thesis by showing bizarre faux lists that are supposedly on BuzzFeed.\n\nConan shows pie charts of how celebrities earn their money, first with real sources then fake ones that insult the subjects.\n\nIn this sketch, Conan has supposedly sent out questionnaires to celebrities and he reads their replies. Conan reads a question and then recites the answer that each of three celebrities gave. The answers of the first two celebrities are ordinary \"straight\" answers. The third is the gag answer and often relates to something unseemly about the celebrity. For example, to the question: \"I like to think of my viewers as people who...\" Brian Williams wrote \"want to be informed.\" Meredith Vieira wrote \"want to be my friend.\" Tony Danza wrote \"have broken both arms and can't change the channel;\" A running joke has the survey frequently including a question which is answered by O.J. Simpson somehow referring to committing murder. To the question: \"My favorite time of day is...\" Evangeline Lilly wrote: \"Dawn.\" Matt Lauer wrote \"Twilight\". O. J. Simpson wrote: \"Murder O'Clock.\" A reply where Paris Hilton is the final respondent to a question has been used in every segment for at least the last four years, usually about her promiscuous dating habits. O'Brien and bandleader Max Weinberg have been used as well, with answers that perceive O'Brien as a loser and Max as a pervert. Another running gag has Larry King, Chris Christie and Barack Obama answering, usually poking fun at King's elderly age (even going as far as to him making responses such that he created the universe or something similar), Christie's weight and Obama repeatedly mentioning that he ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden. Actress Lindsay Lohan and her drunken car crashes, Gary Busey's bizarre statements, Nicolas Cage's poor film role choices, and Aerosmith front man Steven Tyler's similarity to a middle aged woman have also been portrayed in the sketch repeatedly.\n\nConan states he believes all Americans should pass the U.S. citizenship test before they are allowed to vote, then takes the test himself. His version begins with serious American history questions like the actual test (which Conan answers thoroughly and correctly), then devolves into popular culture and sexual questions. One example of this is:\n\nAndy: \"When is it not appropriate to say the phrase 'That's what she said?\"<br>\nConan: \"Never.\"<br>\nAndy: \"Conan, I'm surprised you're answering these correctly. They're really hard!\"<br>\nConan: \"Heh-heh! That's what she said\n\nThere is a recurring theme among the last two questions in each sketch: the next-to-last question involves Conan giving a detailed explanation of a somewhat-obscure American history topic, while the last question references a pop culture or sex question asked earlier in the sketch.\n\nConan, with little to no gaming experience or interest, tries out new video game releases while bantering back and forth with content producer and avid gamer Aaron Bleyaert and a celebrity guest. Initially launched as a web-only franchise, Clueless Gamer grew to become one of the most popular segments on the regular show. Most of the segments have featured new games on current systems, though one segment had Conan and Aaron playing classic Atari 2600 games, including \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", widely considered the worst video game of all time. A full series based on Clueless Gamer is currently in development for TBS, with Conan executive producing but not hosting the series. \nConan conducts a satellite interview with a celebrity, in reality a member of the show's staff whose mouth is superimposed over the celebrity's photo (a technique known as Synchro-Vox best known for its use in the cartoon series \"Clutch Cargo\"). Celebrities impersonated on \"Conan\" include Donald Trump and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who promotes his \"smash hit holiday classic\" \"Jingle All the Way\" as he had frequently done on \"Late Night\".\n\nConan reviews coffee table books that didn't sell, such as \"Movie Stars With Their Eyes Pushed Closer Together\" or \"Dirty Crop Circles\" (the back of which was so dirty it had to be censored).\nIn late January 2016, Conan presented a variation titled \"Calendars That Didn't Sell\".\n\nConan explains how a lot of his viewers record his show with their DVR, and does a skit which requires viewers to pause and un-pause their DVRs rapidly to watch it properly: a long list of text which scrolls by in a few seconds. So far the list titles have been \"New \"Game of Thrones\" Characters\", and \"Nicolas Cage's Next 400 Films\".\n\nConan mentions a recent celebrity or other unusual newsworthy incident, but says there's no actual footage of it. Instead, he shows a reenactment of it using shelled peanuts and toys.\n\nConan announces he is going to share his thoughts via a blog to appeal to his broadening online following by adolescent viewers. The screen then cuts to a simulation of a webcam with Conan in front of a wall in what looks like a typical teenager's room. Conan puts a webcam near his face and speaks in a nervous, monotonous voice. Much of the segment is devoted to Conan saying things that are stereotypically said in teenagers' YouTube videos, such as reviews of movies and TV shows, strange snack ideas he invented and funny photo-shopped pictures he created. All of his segments are introduced using a computer generated voice. Andy sometimes joins Conan as well.\n\nConan tells about a controversial topic in the news while Deon Cole rolls by on a small desk asking yes or no questions about it to quell the controversy, and ends with \"Well then they should shut the fuck up!\".\n\nConan will show rare, never-before-seen director's cuts of clips from classic Warner Brothers movies, which always end with the main character being murdered.\n\nAfter the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, Conan began airing audio from faux phone calls between incoming President Donald Trump (John Di Domenico) and outgoing President Barack Obama (Ben Campbell), in which Trump asks Obama for advice, or just to chat, shown in a split screen of actual photographs of them on the phone. The calls are meant to make Obama seem intelligent and knowledgeable and Trump to appear immature, foolish and unprepared for the presidency. Some of the calls had his daughter Ivanka Trump screaming like a spoiled teenager in the background or Melania Trump pleading for help. \n\nLater skits had Trump talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, some of which where interrupted by a naive and over trusting Donald Trump Jr. (who had just accidentally given private, incriminating emails to the pizza delivery man).\n\nConan will pick a member of the audience and take a photo of them with himself using a green screen and props and suggest they make it their Facebook profile picture.\n\nConan shows videos from viewers who believe they've caught a factual mistake made on the show. However, Conan will claim they don't make mistakes, and so far, they've had \"hundreds of challengers, not one winner\". Conan will then make up a ridiculous story to explain the error and back it up with fake or doctored footage, or fake experts played by the show's writers, all while berating the accuser. When the sketch is over he challenges viewers to \"see if they have what it takes to make chump meat out of the maestro\".\n\nIn an updated version of the classic \"Late Night\" sketch If They Mated, two videos of celebrities are merged, usually the face of one onto another while the second talks (i.e. Nicki Minaj's face and voice on President Obama's head and torso).\n\nConan explains that since the show airs during local newscasts, they decided to make one of their own, with stories and items stereotypically found in them (a fire on the bad part of town, a city council meeting, a short weather forecast, the local sports team won, and a lighthearted animal video at the end). Other sketches have featured Ritcher as an investigative reporter or as a weatherman (reporting on a flurry of snow on LaBamba).\n\nAndy reveals his new bit, which involves him saying \"Memba This?\" repeatedly at pictures of fads and personalities in the news from years past. When Conan replies that this is not really a bit, Andy responds with more pictures of personalities, only this time saying \"Memba Him?\", \"Memba Her\" and \"Memba Them?\" Fed up, Conan tries the bit himself, only the pictures he is given are disturbing, causing him to recoil in disgust. Andy makes it better by saying \"Memba This\" and showing pictures of Conan recoiling at his \"Memba This\" pictures.\n\nAs Conan responds to a news article about race and civil rights, the camera cuts to bassist Mike Merritt making comments, via voice over, about how Conan knows nothing about African Americans and cracks a joke about Conan's race.\n\nThe skit was later changed when Conan came out in support of gay marriage, with the thoughts coming from three of the show's gay staffers. They were able to communicate with each other telepathically, and claimed all gay people have the ability to do so but don't tell straight people about it.\n\nConan mentions that a certain actor has been given a certain movie role in a superhero or fantasy movie sequel, an audience member dressed in the character's costume asks if he's sure. When Conan assures them that the part has been cast, the costumed-audience member leaves disappointed. So far, the roles included Gandalf and an African American Bilbo Baggins (\"The Hobbit\"), Superman (\"Man of Steel\") and a man dressed as Catwoman (\"The Dark Knight Rises\").\n\nConan explains TBS' asked his staff to help develop original shows for the network, and runs of a clip from one. They are often simply parodies of other current shows.\n\n\"Newscasters Agree\" (also known or referred to as \"Media Reacts\") is a segment in which Conan presents to the audience a montage of dozens of local news anchors presenting \"their own fresh take\" on stories in the news. The stories the anchors present are usually in the scope of human interest or entertainment stories, with the lead headline presented by the anchors in near-precise, word-for-word unison. Some prime examples have included:\n\n\"Twinkie Trouble!\" in regards to the bankruptcy of Hostess Brands<br>\"Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?\" about the website matchpuppy.com,<br>\"Mike Myers says 'Yeah, Baby!'\" about the actor who played Austin Powers becoming an expectant father<br>\"Don't worry, be happy,\" a story on how positive attitudes lead to healthy lifestyles (with a few references to the Bobby McFerrin song of the same name).\n\nLike other basic cable shows (\"Mad Men\", \"Game of Thrones\") Conan shows clips from their next episode (which are actually from old episodes) that seem melodramatic when played out of context.\n\nConan, Andy and Pierre (poorly) reenact scenes from films nominated for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards. They performed clips from \"127 Hours\", \"Black Swan\", \"The Social Network\", and \"Inception\". In 2012 movies that were featured were \"The Artist\", \"War Horse\" and \"The Help\".\n\nIn another set of skits, Conan mentioned that \"War Horse\" was nominated for Best Original Score, but he claimed the music doesn't make any sense. He then showed a dramatic scene from it, with the music replaced by an upbeat disco song.\n\nThis list includes all Academy Awards winners who have appeared on the show and say the word \"Fuck\" during the interview. After the celebrity is inducted, Andy Richter reveals a bust statue that does not resemble the celebrity at all, with Andy claiming the best sculptors were unavailable so they had to make it themselves. So far there are three members of this Hall of Fame:\nA potential fourth member, Natalie Portman (who was at the time in the running for an Oscar at the 83rd Academy Awards), did say the word \"fuck\" during her interview. Conan stated during her interview that he would add her to the hall if she won later (which she now has), but it has not happened yet.\n\nAs a parody of Animal Planet's \"Puppy Bowl\", Conan brings in a group of Labrador Retriever puppies dressed as himself, Andy, LaBamba and celebrity guests such as Flava Flav and Lady Gaga, all within a miniature replica of the show's main set. Conan promised he would do an entire show with a miniature set with extremely tall guests like Shaquille O'Neal, which he fulfilled a few weeks later.\n\nAfter Conan mentions a story about something in the news that's controversial because of suspected racism, writer Deon Cole appears and gives a brief commentary, which is usually only a few words. For example, a class action lawsuit by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against SeaWorld which alleges the theme park treats its whales like African slaves in the United States prior to the American Civil War, to which Cole's comment was \"Are you shitting me?!\" Deon will often have one of the show's white writers read his commentary instead, to avoid reinforcing the \"angry black man\" stereotype.\n\nConan has demonstrated zero tolerance for obnoxious audience members, Andy's antics, and even a mascot for Anthony Weiner's penis. There have been five or more instances where Conan has motioned for security to take away an offending character. They drag the person to the top of the studio's roof and then throw them onto the hard concrete lot below.\n\nDuring the show's visit to Atlanta in April 2013, a mannequin of Union Army General William Tecumseh Sherman (the victor of the Battle of Atlanta) was thrown off the roof of TBS' headquarters. When he didn't die, they deep fried his head in waffle batter and shot him out of the city from a giant cannon.\n\nWhen the show was in San Diego for Comic Con in 2016, the security guards threw Captain Make America Great Again (a hybrid of Captain America and Donald Trump) out of a top floor window of the Spreckels Theater Building.\n\nConan and Andy take turns reading phrases that they claim have never been texted or tweeted ever before in the history of mankind. Examples include \"I'm sorry I can't take a lunch break right now, we are totally swamped here at RadioShack.\"\n\nConan will list hidden items of the terms of service for popular smartphone apps, such as on female driven dating app Bumble, you agree to send unsolicited dick pics.\n\nConan mentions there's too many TV shows on the air to keep up with and how he uses the info button for more details, and then sees fake electronic program guides, which insult the characters or the audience, including guide info for his own show which will insult him.\n\nConan points out reasons for why \"China is kicking our ass\" such as better educated students and lower rates of unemployment. He then shows videos of people doing stupid things to injure themselves on purpose, or celebrities embarrassing themselves on television. Ironically, the Chinese text that appears on screen reads 瓷为什么踢我们的屁股 (Why Porcelain Is Kicking Our Ass) instead of 为什么中国在踢我们的屁股. The mistake was noticed by several viewers who spoke Chinese during a Fan Corrections segment, with Conan claiming they were all wrong, and showed a speech of Mao Se Tung after the Chinese Civil War (with mistranslated subtitles), declaring China's new name as the \"People's Republic of Porcelain.\"\n\nConan reads some funny (fake) celebrity tweets that make fun of the celebrities.\n\nA fictitious new made-for-TV movie is announced, based on a real-life event Conan has mentioned. Conan then says he has the inside scoop on the movie's casting. Viewers are shown two photos side-by-side of a person or thing who will be portrayed in the movie and the person that will be playing the role. The casting first starts off with people who strikingly resemble the person they are playing but then goes off to extremes with, usually, objects or fictitious characters bearing some resemblance to the person they are playing.\n\nConan awards members of the studio audience for various talents. Typically this will always include \"best celebrity impression\" to highlight lookalikes (as in movie casting), and then a variety of other awards which are achieved with props and superimposed images. For example, the winner of \"Best Foreign Language Audience Member\" was shown with a large superimposed mustache and sombrero, and the \"Audience Member Who Smells the Most Like Fresh Salmon\" was attacked by a man in a bear costume. Awards show intermission segments (a fashion critic, red carpet interviews, how the award is built, etc.) are also parodied.\n\nSometimes on the show, celebrities make brief surprise cameos in skits.\n\nConan mentions that the number of biracial babies is on the rise in the United States. Conan then brings out Deon Cole to comment, and all he said was \"You're welcome America.\" Conan then said he didn't understand the joke. Chris Parnell then appeared and explained that Deon is so irresistible to fertile young women and his sperm is so potent, he's fathered thousands of biracial children.\n\nHe later returned to explain how Deon is able to take undistorted pictures of his enormous penis with the iPhone 5's panoramic camera. He also explained that Deon's claim reinforces the stereotype that all black men have larger than average sized penises.\n\nIn response to \"Two and a Half Men\" co-star Charlie Sheen's comment that he was a troll, Cryer appeared in a cameo and confessed that he was indeed born a troll doll, and that other celebrities such as Helen Mirren were also once trolls.\n\nConan announced that Larry King is hosting a new show in the rafters of his own studio. King appeared in a cameo and began taking calls from viewers, similar to the format of \"Larry King Live\". Andy Richter was always the show's celebrity guest.\n\nConan mentions his theme song now has lyrics and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic appeared and performed it. The first half was normal, describing the show in general, but then turned dark, describing the time Yankovic and Conan went camping and Conan killed someone and swore Al to secrecy (which he had just broke by announcing it on national television, and feared Conan would kill him too).\n\nActor and woodworking enthusiast Nick Offerman reads actual tweets from young (18–30 years old) female celebrities, such as Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Miranda Cosgrove, while building furniture. They are often short and nonsensical, but read in a serious manner.\n\nSuper Dave Osborne appeared and explained he sued a plastic surgeon for a botched lip enhancement procedure. He explained the judge would award him $10,000,000 if he would go on a talk show, tell three dirty jokes, and prove the people weren't laughing at them, but at his ridiculous lips. After doing so, Conan claims he won the case.\n\nConan mentions \"The Mentalist\" is shot on the same lot as his show, and offers a fan of it accompany him to meet its star Simon Baker. After finding him reading a magazine behind the show's studio, Baker ran off as fast as he could.\n\nConan mentioned \"Jersey Shore\" is looking for new male cast members. He then showed audition tapes featuring Jack McBrayer, DJ Qualls, Jesse Eisenberg, and John Lithgow. Actual \"Jersey Shore\" cast member Mike Sorrentino also briefly appeared, however the casting director quickly yelled \"NEXT!\"\n\nOn October 28, 2014, Conan noticed that their house band's drummer James Wormworth had wandered off and fallen into an abandoned mine shaft. Conan then asked if anyone in the audience can play the drums, and Max Weinberg, leader of the band of the show's original incarnation \"Late Night\", answered and ran onstage to drum for the remainder of the episode.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36382452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36382452", "title": "List of video game soundtracks released on vinyl", "text": "List of video game soundtracks released on vinyl\n\nThe practice of releasing video game soundtracks on vinyl records began in the 1980s, fell out of favor in the 1990s and 2000s as vinyl records were replaced by other storage media, and experienced a resurgence of interest in the 2010s due in part to a vinyl revival.\n\nVinyl recordings of video game music find their origins in the 1970s with early experiments by Kraftwerk and albums such as Yellow Magic Orchestra's self-titled 1978 release sampling electronic music from the games \"Circus\", \"Space Invaders\", and \"Gun Fight\". In 1984, Haruomi Hosono released the first generally recognized video game soundtrack album, \"Video Game Music\", and the practice experienced its \"golden age\" in the mid-to-late 1980s with hundreds of releases including Buckner & Garcia's \"Pac-Man Fever\", Namco's \"Video Game Graffiti\", and Koichi Sugiyama's orchestral covers of the \"Dragon Quest\" series. The 1990s saw many fewer commercial releases and a shift to promo releases with increasing use of video game samples in rap and hip hop.\n\nThe trend away from vinyl discs continued in the 2000s as fan-made remixes also began to be produced, however by the 2010s the trend reversed and the practice of producing video game soundtracks on vinyl experienced a revival. The vinyl revival of the 2010s has itself been attributed to inspiration in younger music buyers from video games, and it has led to the establishment of video game soundtrack oriented vinyl record labels like Black Screen Records, Data Discs, Brave Wave, and iam8bit, and shifts toward similar releases for labels like Ghost Ramp, Ship To Shore Phonograph Co., and Mondo Tees. In a 2015 article, music journalist Mike Diver suggested that \"this scene within a scene is experiencing boom times\", however he noted that some in the music industry, including Invada manager Redg Weeks, were concerned by the risk of over-saturation of the market. These concerns were later repeated by Jamie Crook of Data Discs, and although he has joined Mondo's Mo Shafeek in arguing that the vinyl medium itself and the related revival is in no way a fad or bubble, in 2017 \"Kotaku\" reported concerns from dedicated video game soundtrack labels that pressing plants were scheduling their manufacturing runs last in order to favor traditional labels.\n\nThe 2000s-2010s revival of interest in this medium has been characterized by releases in limited numbers and promotional albums only available at special events or as pre-order bonuses. In addition, the practice has been adopted by the cult and Indie game scenes, with its proponents citing audio quality, interactivity, artwork, nostalgia, unique content, and the fact that vinyl albums represent tangible aspects of intangible (digitally distributed) products as key elements to what makes vinyl soundtrack albums attractive. Additional considerations for collectors include archival and preservation aspects for older games, examination and recontextualization of the music as a means to expand or further explore the game, and curiosity among audiophiles unfamiliar with video gaming music as a genre. Due to the limited nature of modern releases, many albums are considered highly collectible, with some regularly selling in excess of $100 USD. For Western collectors, additional difficulty is imposed by the cost of importing albums from Japan where the majority were produced during the \"golden age\" of the 1980s.\n\nThe use of grooved vinyl discs as a sequenced/encoded rather than recorded data storage medium enabled the code of full motion videos (FMVs) and even simple video games to be stored in an analog format along with the soundtrack and sound effects. These vinyl data discs took two forms: the FMV-only Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED), and the program sheet. Uncommon even in the early 1980s when the practice was at its height, program sheet game data required that users record from the disc (typically a flexi disc like the \"Interface Age\" \"Floppy ROM\") onto an audio cassette tape which could then be used via the cassette port with microcomputers such as the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Commodore PET, Commodore VIC-20, Dragon 32/64, ZX81, or ZX Spectrum. The use of CEDs to store video game FMV data was even less common, and required the game console (typically an arcade machine) to select a section of the grooved track to read with its stylus at just the right time for the video to be displayed. The numerous limitations of these techniques (background noise, scratches, and other audio-fidelity problems) contributed to their failure to receive widespread acceptance and video game data stored in this manner remains some of the most difficult to archive and preserve.\n\n"}

In 2006, Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel \"American Born Chinese\", originally published as a webcomic on Modern Tales, was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award. Don Hertzfeldt's animated film based on his webcomics, \"Everything Will Be OK\", won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, a prize rarely bestowed on an animated film.\n\nWebcomic artists have also won comic awards from organizations that generally honor print comics, such as the Ignatz Awards and Eisner Awards, and there are awards, such as the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, which are given only to webcomics. \n\nFrom 2001 until 2008, the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards were given out, with voting rights granted only to online cartoonists. Because of the large number of categories, such as \"Best Art\", \"Best Writing\", \"Best Gag Comic\" and \"Best Newcomer\", only the winners of the main category \"Best Comic\" are listed here. The following articles provide complete listings of all nominees and winners in each year:\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, users of internet forum The Webcomic List held an amateur award ceremony, where winners of its various categories were selected through a panel of judges. The ceremony itself was presented in the form of a webcomic, allowing it to spoof televised award shows as well as exhibit sample portions of the awardees.\n\nThe Eagle Award is a series of awards for comic book titles and creators. They are awarded by UK fan voting for work produced during the previous year. The awards featured a \"favourite web-based comic\" category from 2001 until its discontinuation in 2012.\n\nThe Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, commonly shortened to the Eisner Award, is a prize given for creative achievement in American comic books. In 2003, Justine Shaw's \"Nowhere Girl\" received a nomination for an Eisner award in the \"best new series\" category, while Shaw was nominated for \"talent deserving of wider recognition\", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner. \"Paste Magazine\" noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of \"digital comic\" and \"webcomic\" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as Marvel Unlimited and DC Comics' \"Digital First\". In 2017, it was split into \"Best Digital Comic\" and \"Best Webcomic\".\n\nThe Harvey Awards, named for writer-artist Harvey Kurtzman (1924-1993) and coordinated by the publisher Fantagraphics, are given for achievement in comic books. The Harveys were created as part of a successor to the Kirby Awards which were discontinued after 1987.\n\nFollowing the revamp in 2018 after the awards moved to New York Comic Con, the \"Best Online Comics Work\" has been renamed \"Digital Book of the Year\".\n\nThe Ignatz Awards are intended to recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year since 1997, but skipped a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Recipients of the award are determined by the votes of the attendees of the annual Small Press Expo.\n\nThe award for webcomics was first awarded in 2012 for work produced during the previous year. It was divided the following year into two separate categories, \"On-Line Comics – Short Form\" and \"On-Line Comics – Long Form\".\n\nPresented by the \"Slate Book Review\" and the Center for Cartoon Studies, the Cartoonist Studio Prize was first awarded in 2013 for work produced during the previous year. The award has two categories, \"Best Print Comic\" and \"Best Web Comic\".\n\nThe Weblog Awards were held from 2003 to 2008 and featured a \"best comic strip\" category starting in 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "1123773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123773", "title": "Literary fiction", "text": "Literary fiction\n\nLiterary fiction is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having literary merit from most commercial or \"genre\" fiction. All the same, a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, John Banville publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood have written science fiction. Furthermore, Nobel laureate André Gide stated that Georges Simenon, best known as the creator of the fictional detective Jules Maigret, was \"the most novelistic of novelists in French literature\".\n\nNeal Stephenson has suggested that, while any definition will be simplistic, there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand, literary authors are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, Stephenson suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales. \n\nHowever, the distinction is becoming blurred with major writers of literary fiction, like Nobel laureate Doris Lessing, as well as Margaret Atwood, writing science fiction. Doris Lessing described science fiction as \"some of the best social fiction of our time\", and called Greg Bear, author of \"Blood Music\", \"a great writer\". Also Georges Simenon, the creator of the Maigret detective novels, has been described by American composer and writer Ned Rorem as \"one of the five greatest French writers of our century\". Rorem placed Simenon in the company of Proust, Gide, Cocteau, and Sartre. \n\nIn an interview, John Updike lamented that \"the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit\". Likewise, on \"The Charlie Rose Show\", Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because \"they are written in words\".\n\nCharacteristics of literary fiction generally include one or more of the following:\n\n\n"}

Her father was Robert E. Sharlach and her mother was the English actress and singer Jenny Dawson (d. 1936). Dainton made her stage debut on 24 March 1894 at York Theatre Royal in \"Little Red Riding Hood\". In this show she gave imitations of well-known theatrical personalities, and this gift for mimicry became her trademark. Dainton became a versatile performer in various theatrical genres, including musical comedy, pantomime and revue.\n\nDainton made her first London appearance at the Metropolitan music hall in Edgware Road on 6 August 1894. On 24 December 1894 she opened as 'Mr Falsehood' in \"The House that Jack Built\" at the Opera Comique, and the following year toured as 'Flo' in \"Buttercup and Daisy\". The next few years were spent appearing mainly in the music halls until June 1899, when she scored a big success at the Avenue Theatre giving impressions of popular stage stars in a production entitled \"Pot Pourri\". In 1898 Dainton appeared in the pantomime \"Puss in Boots\" with Eugene Stratton at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Birmingham. She also appeared in the legitimate theatre. Dainton was in demand both in London and on tour in the British provinces and abroad. During 1900 and 1901 she appeared at the Casino Theatre in New York, and at the Apollo Theatre in London, as Paquita in \"The Belle of Bohemia\". In New York she was temporarily restrained from appearing in the show until a breach of contract case was resolved in the courts. She also toured Austria as Fifi in \"The Belle of New York\". At the Strand Theatre in London in 1902 she appeared in the successful musical play \"A Chinese Honeymoon\". In 1902 she made several gramophone recordings for the Gramophone & Typewriter Co Ltd and Pathé of songs from this show, namely \"The à la Girl\", \"Sweet Little Sing-Sing\", and \"Mandie of Ohio\".\n\nDainton was the original \"Peggy Machree\" at Wyndham's Theatre in London from 28 December 1904, and played the leading role in the original production of \"The Girl Behind the Counter\", again at Wyndham's, from 21 April 1906. Dainton was a leading figure in the Music Hall War of 1907, alongside, among others, Joe Elvin, Gus Elen and Marie Lloyd. At the Colonial Theatre in New York in March 1909 Dainton appeared in vaudeville, again performing her mimicry of celebrities, including Harry Lauder, Anna Held, Marie Tempest, Marie Lloyd and Mrs Patrick Campbell.\n\nIn October 1909 Dainton made a second tour of the United States, playing in Philadelphia and Chicago in \"The Silver Star\" and \"Madame Sherry\". In 1910 she toured the English provinces as Clarice in the opera \"The Mountaineers\" before returning to the music halls. Among other productions, she took part in \"Autumn Manoeuvres\" on tour in 1912, \"I Should Worry\" at The Palace Theatre and on tour in 1913.\n\nShe appeared in \"Society Ltd\" in 1920, \"Riverside Nights\" in 1926, \"The Eternal Flame\" in 1929, and in \"Getting George Married\" in 1930. Her last appearances took place in the early 1930s, playing the Duchess of Capablanca in \"The Werewolf\", an eight performance run produced at the Kingsway Theatre, London, on 9 November 1932 by the Independent Theatre Club; and as a Slut in the play \"Mary Read\" at London's Phoenix Theatre in 1934.\n\nMarie Dainton died in London on 1 February 1938. \n\n"}

{"id": "21514238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21514238", "title": "Multiliteracy", "text": "Multiliteracy\n\nMultiliteracies is a term coined in the mid-1990s by the New London Group and is an approach to literacy theory and pedagogy. This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: linguistic diversity, and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in globalized environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new communications technologies such as the internet, multimedia, and digital media, and the existence of growing linguistic and cultural diversity due to increased transnational migration. Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new \"literacy\" must also be used and developed.\nThere are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the English language is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, global language, there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different Englishes. The way English is spoken in Australia, South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK.\nThe second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate. These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world.\n\nThe formulation of \"A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies\" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains. The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities. The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and numeracy.\n\nDue to changes in the world, especially globalization and an increase in immigration, a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal. A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice. Students need to draw on their own experiences and semiotic literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning.\n\nThe changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines.\n\nEducational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, vernaculars, as well as alternative forms of communication. \n\nThe New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single national language and standardized form of English. The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; Bill Cope from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; Mary Kalantzis from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; Norman Fairclough from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; Gunther Kress from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; James Gee from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; Allan Luke from Australia on critical literacy and applied linguistics; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and Martin Nataka on indigenous education and higher education curriculum. The article \"A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures\" published in 1996, documents the New London Group's \"manifesto\" of literacy pedagogy that is recommended for use in educational institutions, in the community, and within organizations.\n\nThe multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of \"metalanguages\" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.\n\nSituated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996) as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope & Kalantzis (2009) reframed it as “experiencing” (p. 184)\".\" They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms.\n\nSituated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. Authentic pedagogy was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to didactic pedagogy in the twentieth century, initially through the work of John Dewey in the United States and Maria Montessori in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression.\n\nHowever, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.\n\nCritical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001) discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field.\n\nMills (2009) discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as \"inferior literacies\". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums.\n\nIn addition to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. Domingo, Jewitt, & Kress (2014) address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble.\n\nMultiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014) or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, & Buthelezi, 2005). However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo & Rowsell, 2012).\n\nIn the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000, p. 33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, \"Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design\" (p. 116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to \"languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice\" (p. 34).\n\nAfter applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009, 2015). \nConceptualizing involves \"the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts\" (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015, p. 19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p. 19) occurs in two ways:\nConceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular.\n\nActivity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things\nConceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009, p. 185). \nActivity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together\n\nTransformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996) as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in authentic learning, where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the \"theory becomes reflective practice\" (The New London Group, 1996, p. 87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic.\n\nTransformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed \"Applying\" as part of \"Knowledge Processes\" (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009, p. 184), formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or competency-based learning (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015). While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways:\n\n\n"}

The company flew below the radar for a while, but is fast becoming known on the New York Performance Arts scene, and being identified as uniquely Brooklyn. In fact, many are calling it a Brooklyn movement of performance artists and a haven for the aspiring actor.\n\nNYCODA was established as an annual performance festival and competition, where actors can compete in different genres, such as Shakespearean Drama, Dramatic Duologue, Humorous Verse and Open Reading. Actors compete in these categories, with the Open Reading category a favorite, because the actor has freedom to choose what to perform. In fact, many actors write and perform their own work in this category.\n\nThe NYCODA competition is typically held in the Fall of each year in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Contestants submit samples of their performances, typically monologues, via the company's website. The contestants are chosen months in advance, and are notified by the Summer preceding the Fall event. The festival is a one-day event and category winners are chosen at the end of the night and presented with some of the most sought after awards in the industry, with the biggest award, The NYCODA Actor Award going to the overall winner of the festival. The event is recorded for television purposes.\n\nWhile the NYCODA festival primarily features competing actors, many other performance artists are included. Dancers, singers and other performers help add to the rich and complex texture of the event, and now the festival is being called the Sundance Festival of Brooklyn and the buzz is already alive in the community of aspiring actors, who see the festival and competition as another outlet to have their skills recognized and an opportunity to perform live on stage in front of a large audience.\n\nMany noteworthy organizations are already in line to endorse the NYCODA movement, and to applaud it as the festival for which New York has long waited. The company has begun to develop an international outlook and has begun partnering with international agencies, in Africa and Europe. Through their international program, NYCODA welcomes actors and performance artists from all over the country and all over the world, and some NYCODA contestants have the opportunity to perform internationally as well.\n"}

The idea behind this is that making a video is easy and accessible, and is a great way of bringing people together to explore issues, voice concerns or simply to be creative and tell stories. It is therefore primarily about process, though high quality and accessible films (products) can be created using these methods if that is a desired outcome. This process can be very empowering, enabling a group or community to take their own action to solve their own problems, and also to communicate their needs and ideas to decision-makers and/or other groups and communities. As such, PV can be a highly effective tool to engage and mobilise marginalised people, and to help them to implement their own forms of sustainable development based on local needs.\n\n\nWhilst there are forms of documentary filmmaking that are able to sensitively represent the realities of their subjects' lives and even to voice their concerns, documentary films very much remain the authored products of a documentary filmmaker. As such, the subjects of documentaries rarely have any say (or sometimes have some limited say) in how they will ultimately be represented. By contrast, in PV the subjects make their own film in which they can shape issues according to their own sense of what is important, and they can also control how they will be represented. Additionally, documentary films are often expected to meet stringent aesthetic standards and are usually made with a large audience in mind. The PV process, on the other hand, is less concerned with appearance than with content, and the films are usually made with particular audiences and objectives in mind.\n\nThe first experiments in PV were the work of Don Snowden, a Canadian who pioneered the idea of using media to enable a people-centered community development approach. Then Director of the Extension Department at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Snowden worked with filmmaker Colin Low and the National Film Board of Canada's Challenge for Change program to apply his ideas in Fogo Island, Newfoundland, a small fishing community. By watching each other’s films, the different villagers on the island came to realise that they shared many of the same problems and that by working together they could solve some of them. the films were also shown to politicians who lived too far away and were too busy to actually visit the island. As a result of this dialogue, government policies and actions were changed. The techniques developed by Snowden became known as the Fogo process. Snowden went on to apply the Fogo process all over the world until his death in India in 1984.\n\nThe first community-made video in Canada was the 1969 Challenge for Change video \"VTR St-Jacques\", filmed in a poor Montreal neighbourhood. In order to make \"VTR St-Jacques\", directors Dorothy Henault and Bonnie Sherr Klein trained community members in video to represent their struggle for affordable and accessible medical care. \"VTR St-Jacques\" was shown across Canada and the U.S., inspiring other projects.\n\nThere has been no uniform movement to promote and practise PV but different individuals and groups have set up pockets of PV work, usually molding it to their particular needs and situations. PV has also grown with the increasing accessibility of home video equipment.\n\nAn early and significant book on participatory video was published in the UK in 1997 by Clive Robertson and Jackie Shaw, Directors of Real Time Video, and has informed many subsequent books and articles, including the book this article has drawn from. Real Time are an educational charity that pioneered many of the techniques and methodologies still used today, and have been working in the participatory video field since 1984.\n\nIn combination with other methodologies such as Participatory Learning in Action (PLA) techniques, Participatory Rural Appraisal and others. PV has been successfully applied to projects focussing on; community development; promoting local innovation and endogenous development; therapeutic work; a voice for marginalised groups; a catalyst for community-led action; a tool for communicating with policy makers; a means of involving users in their own research for example action research, participatory research, user-led research; also for programme monitoring and evaluation or Social impact assessment...new possible applications are being continually developed.\n\n\nWhite, S.

Criteria include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nScript coverage is the summary and analysis of a script's plot and writing quality, used by production companies and agencies to track film and TV screenplays. Coverage consists of a number of elements. The first is a 1-to-2-page synopsis of the script’s story highlighting the main characters and events of the tale. The second is a subjective review of the piece (typical length of which could range anywhere from 1 sentence, in short-form contest coverage, to 2 or 3 pages) which assesses the effectiveness of the screenplay’s various components—including its concept, story structure, story development, characters, dialogue, and writing style—and points out its strong points and problem areas. The evaluation ends with a recommendation from the analyst as to what he/she feels the production entity should do with the script. This recommendation usually employs 1 of 3 terms:\n\n• Pass: The reader feels the script fails to make the grade in most areas and that the production entity should not proceed with it.\n\n• Consider: The reader feels the script has a considerable number of strong points and is good enough to proceed with, while acknowledging that it has a number of significant problems that need to be successfully solved before the piece can be considered suitable for production.\n\n• Recommend: The reader feels the script is extremely strong in all respects and that the production entity should proceed with it without reservation.\n\nWhen completed, the synopsis, review, and evaluation are assembled and fronted with a cover page that lists the script’s vital information (author’s name, story genre, time and locations in which it takes place, length of the script, etc.) and contains a brief summary of the story and the review. The cover page usually includes a checklist in which the script’s various aspects are rated on a scale ranging from poor to excellent. Finally, the cover page highlights the analyst’s ultimate recommendation.\n\nAlthough script coverage is a tool used primarily by motion picture production entities, it is sometimes used by screenwriting competitions as a way of separating \"wheat from chaff.\" The coverage done for script competitions is usually simpler than that done for production companies—substituting a logline (a brief 1 or 2 line summary of the story) for the synopsis and simplifying the assessment—often employing only the checklist rating of the script’s various aspects.\n\nIn addition to production entities and screenwriting competitions, a number of independent services employ a roster of veteran script analysts to provide professional-level coverage for screenwriters who wish to see how their scripts will be received by the industry.This gives the writers a chance to identify and resolve problems before submitting them to production entities.\n\nBy the very nature of summarizing a complicated plot, the coverage will not include every plot twist and subplot. Some characters will be omitted, or only briefly introduced for the sake of brevity. In order to decide on what will stay and what will go, the character and actions must support the main plot, and ultimately the premise of the story. Scripts that are not economical and include peripheral characters, scenes, and storylines that do not support character or plot development do not affect their motivation, and therefore can be omitted from the coverage. In this manner, well-written scripts may have longer synopses than poorly written scripts with a lot of extraneous action.\n"}

{"id": "14682695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14682695", "title": "Technology of television", "text": "Technology of television\n\nThe technology of television has evolved since its early days using a mechanical system invented by Paul Gottlieb Nipkow in 1884. Every television system works on the scanning principle first implemented in the rotating disk scanner of Nipkow. This turns a two-dimensional image into a time series of signals that represent the brightness and color of each resolvable element of the picture. By repeating a two-dimensional image quickly enough, the impression of motion can be transmitted as well. For the receiving apparatus to reconstruct the image, synchronization information is included in the signal to allow proper placement of each line within the image and to identify when a complete image has been transmitted and a new image is to follow.\n\nWhile mechanically-scanned systems were experimentally used, television as a mass medium was made practical by the development of electronic camera tubes and displays. By the turn of the 20th century, it was technically feasible to replace the analog signals for television broadcasting with digital signals. Many television viewers no longer use an antenna to receive over-the-air broadcasts, instead relying on cable television systems. Increasingly these are integrated with telephone and Internet services.\n\nThe elements of a simple broadcast television system are:\n\nPractical television systems include equipment for selecting different image sources, mixing images from several sources at once, insertion of pre-recorded video signals, synchronizing signals from many sources, and direct image generation by computer for such purposes as station identification. The facility for housing such equipment, as well as providing space for stages, sets, offices, etc., is called a television studio, and may be located many miles from the transmitter. Communication from the studio to the transmitter is accomplished via a dedicated cable or radio system.\n\nTelevision signals were originally transmitted exclusively via land-based transmitters. The quality of reception varied greatly, dependent in large part on the location and type of receiving antenna. This led to the proliferation of large rooftop antennas to improve reception in the 1960s, replacing set-top dipole or \"rabbit ears\" antennas, which however remained popular. Antenna rotors, set-top controlled servo motors to which the mast of the antenna is mounted, to enable rotating the antenna such that it points to the desired transmitter, would also become popular.\n\nIn most cities today, cable television providers deliver signals over coaxial or fiber-optic cables for a fee. Signals can also be delivered by radio from satellites in geosynchronous orbit and received by parabolic dish antennas, which are comparatively large for analog signals, but much smaller for digital. Like cable providers, satellite television providers also require a fee, often less than cable systems. The affordability and convenience of digital satellite reception has led to the proliferation of small dish antennas outside many houses and apartments.\n\nDigital systems may be inserted anywhere in the chain to provide better image transmission quality, reduction in transmission bandwidth, special effects, or security of transmission from reception by non-subscribers. A home today might have the choice of receiving analog or HDTV over the air, analog or digital cable with HDTV from a cable television company over coaxial cable, or even from the phone company over fiber optic lines. On the road, television can be received by pocket sized televisions, recorded on tape or digital media players, or played back on wireless phones (mobile or \"cell\" phones) over a high-speed or \"broadband\" internet connection.\n\nThere are now several kinds of video displays used in modern TV sets:\n\n\nEach has its pros and cons. Front projection and plasma displays have a wide viewing angle (nearly 180 degrees) so they may be best for a home theater with a wide seating arrangement. Rear projection screens do not perform well in daylight or well-lit rooms and so are only suitable for darker viewing areas.\n\nPixel resolution is the number of pixels of one row on a given screen. Before the year 2000 \"horizontal lines of resolution\" was the standard method of measurement for analog video. For example, a VHS VCR might be described as having 250 lines of resolution as measured across a circle circumscribed in the center of the screen (approximately 440 pixels edge-to-edge). With analog signals, the number of vertical lines and the frame rate are directly proportional to the bandwidth of the signal transmitted.\n\nA typical resolution of 720×480 and 720x576 means that the television display has 720 pixels across and 480 or 576 pixels on the vertical axis. The higher the resolution on a specified display the sharper the image. Contrast ratio is a measurement of the range between the lightest and darkest points on the screen.\n\nThe higher the contrast ratio, the better looking picture there is in terms of richness, deepness, and shadow detail. The brightness of a picture measures how vibrant and impacting the colors are. Measured in formula_1 equivalent to the number of candles required to power the image.\n\nOn the other hand, the so-called \"brightness\" and \"contrast\" adjustment controls on televisions and monitors are traditionally used to control different aspects of the picture display. The brightness control shifts the black level, affecting the image intensity or brightness, while the contrast control adjusts the contrast range of the image.\n\nThere are various bands on which televisions operate depending upon the country. The VHF and UHF signals in bands III to V are generally used. Lower frequencies do not have enough bandwidth available for television.\n\nCountries with 60 Hz power line frequency use frame rates very near 30 per second, while 50 Hz regions use 25 frames per second. These rates were chosen to minimize distortion of pictures that could be produced in analog receivers. For a given frame rate, an analog signal with 400 lines per frame would use less bandwidth than one with 600 or 800 lines per frame. Higher bandwidth makes receiver design more complicated, requires higher radio frequencies to be used, and may limit the number of channels that can be allocated in a given area; the same radio frequencies useful for television are also in high demand for other services such as aviation, land mobile radio, and mobile telephones.\n\nAlthough the BBC initially used Band I VHF at 45 MHz, this frequency is (in the UK) no longer in use for this purpose. Band II is used for FM radio transmissions. Higher frequencies behave more like light and do not penetrate buildings or travel around obstructions well enough to be used in a conventional broadcast TV system, so they are generally only used for MMDS and satellite television, which uses frequencies from 2 to 12 GHz. TV systems in most countries relay the video as an AM (amplitude-modulation) signal and the sound as an FM (frequency-modulation) signal. An exception is France, where the sound is AM.\n\nAspect ratio refers to the ratio of the horizontal to vertical measurements of a television's picture. Mechanically scanned television as first demonstrated by John Logie Baird in 1926 used a 7:3 vertical aspect ratio, oriented for the head and shoulders of a single person in close-up.\n\nMost of the early electronic TV systems, from the mid-1930s onward, shared the same aspect ratio of 4:3 which was chosen to match the Academy Ratio used in cinema films at the time. This ratio was also square enough to be conveniently viewed on round cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), which were all that could be produced given the manufacturing technology of the time. (Today's CRT technology allows the manufacture of much wider tubes, and the flat-screen technologies which are becoming steadily more popular have no technical aspect ratio limitations at all.) The BBC's television service used a more squarish 5:4 ratio from 1936 to 3 April 1950, when it too switched to a 4:3 ratio. This did not present significant problems, as most sets at the time used round tubes which were easily adjusted to the 4:3 ratio when the transmissions changed.\nIn the early 1950s, movie studios moved towards widescreen aspect ratios such as CinemaScope in an effort to distance their product from television. Although this was initially just a gimmick, widescreen is still the format of choice today and 4:3 aspect ratio movies are rare.\n\nYet the various television systems were not originally designed to be compatible with film at all. Traditional, narrow-screen movies are projected onto a television camera either so that the top of the screens line up to show facial features, or, for films with subtitles, the bottoms. What this means is that filmed newspapers or long captions filling the screen for explanation are cut off at each end. Similarly, while the frame rate of sound films is 24 per second, the screen scanning rate of the NTSC is 29.97 Hz (per second), which requires a complex scanning schedule. That of PAL and SECAM are 50 Hz, which means that films are shortened (and the sound is offkey) by scanning each frame twice for 25 per second.\n\nThe switch to digital television systems has been used as an opportunity to change the standard television picture format from the old ratio of 4:3 (1.33:1) to an aspect ratio of 16:9 (approximately 1.78:1). This enables TV to get closer to the aspect ratio of modern widescreen movies, which range from 1.66:1 through 1.85:1 to 2.35:1. There are two methods for transporting widescreen content, the most common of which uses what is called anamorphic widescreen format. This format is very similar to the technique used to fit a widescreen movie frame inside a 1.33:1 35 mm film frame. The image is compressed horizontally when recorded, then expanded again when played back. The anamorphic widescreen 16:9 format was first introduced via European PALplus television broadcasts and then later on \"widescreen\" Laser Discs and DVDs; the ATSC HDTV system uses straight widescreen format, no horizontal compression or expansion is used.\n\nRecently \"widescreen\" has spread from television to computing where both desktop and laptop computers are commonly equipped with widescreen displays. There are some complaints about distortions of movie picture ratio due to some DVD playback software not taking account of aspect ratios; but this may subside as the DVD playback software matures. Furthermore, computer and laptop widescreen displays are in the 16:10 aspect ratio both physically in size and in pixel counts, and not in 16:9 of consumer televisions, leading to further complexity. This was a result of widescreen computer display engineers' assumption that people viewing 16:9 content on their computer would prefer that an area of the screen be reserved for playback controls, subtitles or their Taskbar, as opposed to viewing content full-screen.\n\nThe television industry's changing of aspect ratios is not without difficulties, and can present a considerable problem.\n\nDisplaying a widescreen aspect (rectangular) image on a conventional aspect (square or 4:3) display can be shown:\n\nA conventional aspect (square or 4:3) image on a widescreen aspect (rectangular with longer horizon) display can be shown:\n\nA common compromise is to shoot or create material at an aspect ratio of 14:9, and to lose some image at each side for 4:3 presentation, and some image at top and bottom for 16:9 presentation. In recent years, the cinematographic process known as Super 35 (championed by James Cameron) has been used to film a number of major movies such as \"Titanic\", \"Legally Blonde\", \"Austin Powers\", and \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\". This process results in a camera-negative which can then be used to create both wide-screen theatrical prints, and standard \"full screen\" releases for television/VHS/DVD which avoid the need for either \"letterboxing\" or the severe loss of information caused by conventional \"pan-and-scan\" cropping.\n\nIn North America, the basic signal standards since 1941 had been compatible enough in 2007 that even the oldest monochrome televisions could still receive color broadcasts. However, the United States Congress passed a law which required the cessation of all conventional television broadcast signals by February 2009. After that date all NTSC standard televisions with analog-only tuners went dark unless fitted with a digital ATSC tuner. The digital channels occupy the same spectrum as the analog channels. Some of the spectrum previously occupied by the highest numbered channels was auctioned off by the United States' Federal Communications Commission for other uses.\n\nPAL and SECAM are expected not to be broadcast in Europe and Eurasia by the mid-2020s. PAL-M may have a similar decommissioning timeline.\n\nThe European Union has recommended its members to close down analogue terrestrial television by 2012. Luxembourg and the Netherlands already completed their closedowns in 2006, and Finland and Sweden closed down their analogue broadcasts in 2007.\n\nBritain started its digital switch in October 2007. At 2am on Wednesday 17 October 2007, the BBC2 transmitter covering the Whitehaven and Copeland areas (NW England) was disabled. The remaining four analogue channels ceased broadcasting shortly after. The original five channels are now available only in digital form, alongside approximately 15 additional free-to-air channels.\n\n\nIn the early days of television, cabinets were made of wood grain (often simulated particularly in the later years), however, they went out of style in the 1980s. Up until the late 1970s, console TV/Hi Fi's were common. These were large (about 6' wide by 4' high) wooden cabinets containing a television, speakers, radio and a turntable.\n\n"}

{"id": "10787339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10787339", "title": "Tom show", "text": "Tom show\n\nTom show is a general term for any play or musical based (often only loosely) on the 1852 novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The novel attempts to depict the harsh reality of slavery. Due to the weak copyright laws at the time, a number of unauthorized plays based on the novel were staged for decades, many of them mocking the novel's strong characters and social message, and leading to the pejorative term \"Uncle Tom\".\n\nEven though \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story in a stage play or musical than read the book. Some of these shows were essentially minstrel shows that utilized caricatures and stereotypes of black people, and thus inverting the intent of the novel. \"Tom shows\" were popular in the United States from the 1850s through the early 1900s.\n\nStage plays based on \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"—\"Tom shows\"—began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics—some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. A number of the productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster, including \"My Old Kentucky Home,\" \"Old Folks at Home,\" and \"Massa's in the Cold Ground.\"\n\nStowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of her puritanical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see George Aiken's version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was \"delighted\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy). Asa Hutchinson of the Hutchinson Family Singers, whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.\n\nEric Lott, in his book \"Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class\", estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just blackface minstrel shows only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes of mockery, some of the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.\n\nAll \"Tom shows\" appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy.\n\nThe first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by C.W. Taylor at Purdy's National Theater (New York City); it ran for about ten performances in August–September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring T.D. Rice. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly racist blackface character Jim Crow, later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in January 1854 at New York's Bowery Theatre, the \"Spirit of the Times<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" reviewer described him as \"decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama.\"\n\nThe best-known \"Tom Shows\" were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway.\n\nAiken's original \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star Cordelia Howard); a sequel, \"The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely\" told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the \"New York Times\" reported that his defiant speech received \"great cheers\" from an audience of Bowery b'hoys and g'hals. Even this most sympathetic of \"Tom shows\" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but Stephen Foster's \"Old Folks at Home\" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning November 15, 1852 in Troy, New York, the play opened in New York City July 18, 1853, where its success was even greater.\n\nConway's production opened in Boston the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; P.T. Barnum brought it to his American Museum in New York November 7, 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, \"buffoons\". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced Yankee character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a John C. Calhoun. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the \"normal\" mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.\n\nShowmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad caricature for laughs, dressing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with a dainty umbrella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a pig.\n\n\"Tom shows\" were so popular that there were even pro-slavery versions. Among the most popular was \"Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom\", produced in 1852 at the Baltimore Museum. Lott mentions numerous \"offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals\" including a full-scale play by Christy's Minstrels and a parody by Conway himself called \"Uncle Pat's Cabin\", and records that the story in its many variants \"dominated northern popular culture… for several years\".\n\nAccording to Eric Lott, even those \"Tom shows\" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the feminist aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism. Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the \"lightness and gayety\" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, the plays increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).\n\nThe influence of the \"Tom shows\" can be found in a number of plays from the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's \"Dred\", but also J.T. Trowbridge's abolitionist play \"Neighbor Jackwood\", Dion Boucicault's \"The Octoroon\", and a play called \"The Insurrection\", based on John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.\n\nThe influence of the \"Tom shows\" also carried over into the silent film era (with \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" being the most-filmed story of that time period). This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and \"Tom shows,\" meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.\n\nSeveral of the early film versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin were essentially filmed versions of \"Tom shows.\" These included:\n\n\nAs cinema replaced vaudeville and other types of live variety entertainment, \"Tom shows\" slowly disappeared. J.C. Furnas, in his book \"Goodbye to Uncle Tom\", stated that he had seen a production in the 1920s in Ohio; the last touring group specializing in \"Tomming\" he could locate was apparently operating as late as the 1950s.\n\n"}
{"id": "8376433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8376433", "title": "Trope (philosophy)", "text": "Trope (philosophy)\n\nThe term \"trope\" is both a term which denotes figurative and metaphorical language and one which has been used in various technical senses. The term \"trope\" derives from the Greek τρόπος (\"tropos\"), \"a turn, a change\", related to the root of the verb τρέπειν (\"trepein\"), \"to turn, to direct, to alter, to change\"; this means that the term is used metaphorically to denote, among other things, metaphorical language. Perhaps the term can be explained as meaning the same thing as \"a turn of phrase\" in its original sense.\n\nThe term is also used in technical senses, which do not always correspond to its linguistic origin. Its meaning has to be judged from the context, some of which are given below.\n\nHere a trope is a figurative and metaphorical use of a word or a phrase. The verb \"to trope\" means then to make a trope.\n\nA trope or mode is one of the ten skeptical arguments or \"ways of refuting dogmatism\", also called The Ten Modes of Pyrrhonism, described by the Greek physician and philosopher Sextus Empiricus.\n\nThe use of tropes has been extended from a linguistic usage to the field of philosophy of history by, among other theorists, Hayden White in his \"Metahistory\" (1973). Tropes are generally understood to be styles of discourse — rather than figures of style — underlying the historian's writing of history. They are historically determined in as much as the historiography of every period is defined by a specific type of trope.\n\nFor Hayden White, tropes historically unfolded in this sequence: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and finally, irony.\n\nTrope theory (or trope nominalism) in metaphysics is a version of nominalism. Here, a trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific redness of a rose, or the specific nuance of green of a leaf. Trope theories assume that universals are unnecessary. This use of the term goes back to D. C. Williams (1953). The basic problem has been discussed previously in philosophy without using the term \"trope\". The following is a brief background:\n\nThe basic problem is the problem of universals. One part of the problem of universals is determining what it is for two tokens (or separate instances of something) to be of the same type. How can different things be the same? The arguments are complex, and involve semantics, metaphysics and epistemology. Part of the problem would be determining what it is for six different green objects to all be the same in respect to their color.\n\nOne classical solution is that of realism as found in the middle period of Plato's philosophy, with the \"Republic\" as a crowning work. According to this solution there are ideas or forms for any property. These forms exist timelessly as singular, perfect individuals in a metaphysical (timeless, supra-sensible) world of their own. They correspond to what is later called universals. Somehow the form of a specific color creates many secondary images of itself, as when a prototype is used to make copies or an object casts several shadows. Expressed more abstractly the individual colour-instances (the green of this leaf, the similar green of this frog) all partake in the same idea of green. In Plato the theory of forms is related to his theses about innate knowledge. In \"Phaedo\" the turn of the argument is that we cannot learn from experience what similarity is through abstraction, but must possess it in an innate form before we have any experience (\"Phaedo\" 74a-75d).\n\nNevertheless, Plato in the \"Parmenides\" dialogue himself formulated several problems for his view. One is: How can the idea, being single, nevertheless be present in a multitude of separate instances without being split apart.\n\nThe other solution is that of nominalism. Here the thesis is that universals such as the ideas or forms of Plato are unnecessary in an explanation of language, thought and the world. Only single individuals are real, but they can be grouped together by a human observer through their similarities. Nominalists are usually empiricists. Berkeley, for example, argued against universals or abstract objects using nominalistic arguments. He used the term idea to denote specific perceptions of an atomistic nature. They could be grouped through similarities or one could take a specific instance, for example the green hue of this frog one is looking at now, as a kind of paradigm case or prototype, and regard everything that was similar to it as belonging to the same type or category. One attraction of the nominalistic program is that if it can be carried out it solves Plato's problem in Parmenides, since the need for a single idea or form or universal \"green\" then vanishes and it can be expunged through Occam's razor, i.e. the rule that, other things being equal, one should not multiply explanatory entities beyond necessity.\n\nBertrand Russell (1912, chapter IX) argued against Berkeley and took the same basic position as Plato. His argument was basically one against any form of nominalism. It says, briefly, that if we introduce several instances of green as separate individuals, we nevertheless have to accept that the reason that we group them together is because they are similar. Therefore, we must presume at least one true universal, that of similarity.\n\nTwo popular recent solutions to the problem of universals, as it relates to the possibility of entities existing in multiple locations at the same time, are as follows.\n\nDavid Armstrong, a prominent Australian philosopher, argues, that there are instantiated universals, like Russell and the middle Plato. Briefly, an instantiated universal is a property (such as being green) that can exist in multiple locations at the same time. Going back to the problem of universals, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to instantiate the universal green. The very same, identical universal green would be wholly located at each green object. To be even more specific, if a frog and a leaf are the same shade of green, the green of the frog and the green of the leaf are one and the same entity (qua green-ness), which happens to be multiply located.\n\nD. C. Williams and Keith Campbell, among others, reject instantiated universals in favor of tropes. Briefly, a trope is a property (such as being green) that can only exist in one location at one time. Trope theorists explain what it is for two tokens (individual instances) to be of the same type in terms of resemblance. As an example, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to have its own distinct green trope. Each green trope would be a different entity from the other green tropes, but they would \"resemble\" each other and would all be taken to be green because of their resemblance. \n\nA metaphysical doctrine embracing both tropes and the objects on which the tropes depend was elaborated by Edmund Husserl in his \"Logical Investigations\", as part of what Husserl called 'formal ontology'. Husserl's ideas in this respect were used as the basis for the theory of truthmaking put forward by Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Barry Smith in \"Truthmakers\" (1984) According to this theory it is tropes -- including both individual qualities and events -- that serve as the truthmakers for true atomic sentences such as 'John is hot' or 'Mary is loved by John' or 'John kicked Bill'.\n\n\n\n"}

It is shown live on London Live in the UK, Fight Now TV in the USA and on Viewster in several other countries.\n\nThe collapse of EliteXC was quickly followed by Cage Rage with its final show Cage Rage 28 in 2008. Later that same year Dave O'Donnell, one of the original owners of Cage Rage, created Ultimate Challenge UK. Their first event 'Bad Breed' covered the spot where Cage Rage 29 was going to take place.\n\nAfter a while of promoting many successful events, UCUK dropped the 'UK' out of the name and replaced it with 'MMA' becoming 'UCMMA'. UCMMA has been steadily approaching the same popularity that Cage Rage once enjoyed.\n\nThey have sponsorships with companies like Cash4Gold, Official Watches, MMA Sports Nutrition, and Coalition fight music.\n\nOn August 6, 2011, UCMMA 22 - Warrior Creed was shown on PPV channel Primetime.\n\nUCMMA can now be watched on Fight Now TV in the United States in a landmark deal for the promotion. The contract with the network is set for 1 year as of February 2012.\n\nAll of UCMMA events from UCMMA 26 - The Real Deal can be purchased from high street retail stores such as Tesco, HMV, and Argos. It can also be purchased at online stores like Zavvi.com, Amazon.com, Lovefilm and The Hut Group.\n\nOn May 28, 2012, UCMMA was featured on BBC One programme How To Beat Pain, which was presented by Greg Whyte and Jack Krindler.\n\nAfter White Collar MMA 6 (WCMMA), UK casting call were taken place at the Troxy for a new American reality show - Warrior Island. Dave O'Donnell hosted the casting call at the request by Global Proving Ground (GPG) President, James Jefferson. The reality show will be directed by Hollywood veteran Ben Perry.\n\nOn October 25 it was announced that, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, that UCMMA have united with The Centre of Health and Human Performance in London to launched SAFE MMA, a nonprofit organization established to improve the safety of MMA fighters in the U.K. Chief among the organization's plans is a centralized and confidential database for fighter medical records. SAFE MMA, which officially launches Jan. 1 2013, also will provide affordable, standardized blood and medical tests for all registered fighters, as well as advice from leading world experts in sports medicine, according to today's announcement.\n\nAs of November 21, 2012, UCMMA can also be seen on Canada's The Fight Network.\n\nAfter Sky Sports cut out all MMA programming from their channels, UCMMA announced that they signed a deal with on-demand channel Primetime for a live broadcasting partnership.\n\nThey show their chat show, Cage Fighter, every Wednesday night on Sky Sports. Dave O'Donnell hosts the 30 minute show with Grant Waterman and interviews MMA fighters, shows clips of previous fights, GYM of the week, KO/Submission of the week and advertises their next event.\n\nUCMMA also shows kickboxing matches during their events, referring to them as 'UK1', named after the well known K-1 kickboxing company based in Japan. Because they hold these fights in the same events as they show MMA, the kickboxers use the cage to compete in.\n\nEach fight will be a three 3 minute round with a minute rest period in between rounds, and if it’s a draw one more round will be fought. Each round will be scored using the 10-point must system. Fighters using the most effective aggression and effective technique will win the round. Also the three knock-down rule applies, and a fighter can only be saved from a count by the bell in the final round. the choice to use MMA gloves or standard kickboxing gloves are agreed to by both fighters. Because of the pace of the action, if fighters get into a clinch they will be allowed a single knee strike and then must break clean. If the referee says ‘break’ they must not hit on the break. Rules are set so that certain things that are allowed in MMA are not used in the UK1 bouts, such as standing/clinching elbow strikes, ground fighting (grappling or striking), trips, takedowns or throws.\n\nSince its first bouts, it has gained popularity, as it makes their fight card more exciting and keeps the audience entertained if the prior fights were boring due to slow pace striking or grappling. It also allows the company to reach the type of audience that dislikes the use of small 6oz MMA gloves, grappling and striking to a grounded opponent. There are also titles in each weight division, which follows the same as their MMA divisions.\n\nDave O'Donnell created White Collar MMA (WCMMA), with the idea that \"gives the average man the chance to experience the thrill of hand to hand combat inside the octagon. Competing in the disciplines of boxing, kick boxing, Muay Thai and MMA, WCMMA lets nine to fivers take the frustrations of the office out on the man to stands toe – 2 - toe with them in the cage.\" He says: ‘Every man who sits behind his desk at work watches MMA fights on YouTube or at home on TV can now give it a go. WCMMA gives that man the chance to live the dream. These guys will compete against each other in three 90 seconds rounds in a safe and controlled environment putting their skills to the test in a safe arena against fellow nine to fivers.’\n\nDave will make sure that all fights are fair and each competitor is in the right condition to fight. There will not be cost cuts on production will give them the opportunity to make their dreams come true. This will be their chance to become Rocky for one night. They will also hold amateur and semi-pro fights as well to allow amateur mixed martial artists a chance to grow their skills before going professional.\n\nUCMMA created a new sport inside MMA during the early part of 2012 called 'Ultimate Ball'. The team-based sport, which combines sports such as rugby, American football, basketball and mixed martial arts, is played in the cage in which both sides try to get the rugby-shaped ball into the opposition's goal, with takedowns and body shots allowed. Ultimate Ball debut at UCMMA 27.\n\nThe concept to Ultimate Ball came to Dave O'Donnell around the time Cage Rage was at its highest peak, but had to wait until UCMMA grew bigger to make the sport happen.\n\nThe rules to Ultimate Ball are:\n\nUltimate Ball tournament\n\n\"The following have also competed for top tier promotions such as UFC\" \n\"Other promotions\"\n"}

{"id": "187861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187861", "title": "V.", "text": "V.\n\nV. is the debut novel of Thomas Pynchon, published in 1963. It describes the exploits of a discharged U.S. Navy sailor named Benny Profane, his reconnection in New York with a group of pseudo-bohemian artists and hangers-on known as the Whole Sick Crew, and the quest of an aging traveler named Herbert Stencil to identify and locate the mysterious entity he knows only as \"V.\" It was nominated for a National Book Award.\n\nThe novel alternates between episodes featuring Benny, Stencil and other members of the Whole Sick Crew (including Profane's sidekick Pig Bodine) in 1956 (with a few minor flashbacks), and a generation-spanning plot that comprises Stencil's attempts to unravel the clues he believes will lead him to \"V.\" (or to the various incarnations thereof). Each of these \"Stencilised\" chapters is set at a different moment of historical crisis; the framing narrative involving Stencil, \"V.\", and the journals of Stencil's British spy/diplomat father threads the sequences together. The novel's two storylines increasingly converge in the last chapters (the intersecting lines forming a V-shape, as it were), as Stencil hires Benny to travel with him to Malta.\n\nThe opening chapter is set in Norfolk, Virginia Christmas Eve, 1955. Benny Profane, a recently discharged seaman, is at a local sailor bar called the \"Sailor's Grave\" in which every waitress is named Beatrice and the beer taps are rubber model breasts that the sailors suck on. Here Profane meets Ploy, a short violent sailor, his musician friend Dewey Gland, and the Maltese barmaid Paola Hod. Bar owner Mrs. Buffo begins to play a rendition of It Came Upon the Midnight Clear to celebrate Christmas only to be immediately assaulted by Ploy and the rest of the intoxicated sailors. The disorder triggers a raid by the military police. Pig Bodine, Paola, Dewey Gland and Profane escape the chaos to Pig's apartment.\n\nThe chapter opens with Rachel Owlglass confronting the plastic surgeon Shale Schoenmaker who she accuses of manipulating her friend and roommate Esther Havitz into debt through repeated rhinoplasty. Schoenmaker responds by entering into a monologue on the nature of Jewish women and the nature of appearance.\n\nSection II is set during a party at Rachel's apartment attended by the \"Sick Crew\", Paola, Esther, and Debb. This section introduces the character Herbert Stencil, a troubled man who is obsessed with his father's mysterious death in Malta and the identity of \"V\", a woman mentioned in his father's journal.\n\nThis chapter, set among the British community in Egypt toward the end of the 19th century, consists of an introduction and a series of eight relatively short sections, each of them from the point of view of a different person. The eight sections come together to tell a story of murder and intrigue, intersecting the life of a young woman, Victoria Wren, the first incarnation of V. The title is a hint as to how this chapter is to be understood: Stencil imagines each of the eight viewpoints as he reconstructs—we do not know on how much knowledge and how much conjecture—this episode. This chapter is a reworking of Pynchon's short story \"Under the Rose\", which was first published in 1961 and is collected in \"Slow Learner\" (1984). In the \"Slow Learner\" introduction, Pynchon admits he took the details of the setting (\"right down to the names of the diplomatic corps\") from Karl Baedeker's 1899 travel guide for Egypt. Stencil's reconstruction follows the same basic conflict as \"Under the Rose\", but it gives the non-European characters much more personality.\n\nSection I details the history of Shale Schoenmaker, M.D. and how he began his career as a plastic surgeon. During World War One he eagerly enlists in the A.E.F. hoping to become a pilot but, is instead given a position as an engineer. While serving he witnesses Evan Godolphin, a handsome pilot whom he idealized, become horribly disfigured during an air raid. A month later Schoenmaker visits Godolphin in the hospital while he is recovering from reconstructive surgery, discovering that an incompetent surgeon, Halidom, treated him using the archaic method that would inevitably lead to further disfigurement by infection. This event traumatizes Schoenmaker, causing him to now see it as his mission to help people like Godolphin, a conviction that slowly decays over time.\n\nOnly marginally part of the Stencil/V. material, this chapter follows Benny and others, as Benny has a job hunting alligators in the sewers under Manhattan. It figures in the Stencil/V. story in that there is a rat named \"Veronica\" who figures in a subplot about a mad priest — Father Linus Fairing, S.J. — some decades back, living in the sewers and preaching to the rats; we hear from him in the form of his diary. Stencil himself makes a brief appearance toward the end of the chapter.\n\nThe chapter follows Profane, Geronimo, Angel, and his sister Josephine \"Fina\" into the city over several nights of drinking. Fina and Profane's relationship develops amid concerns over her status within a local mercenary street gang known as the Playboys, who see her as a spiritual figurehead. The chapter ends amid a massive brawl, nearby which Fina is found lying naked and smiling.\n\nIn Florence in 1899, Victoria appears again, briefly, but so does the place name \"Vheissu\", which may or may not stand for Vesuvius, Venezuela, a crude interpretation of \"wie heißt du\", translating into \"who are you\" in the German language, or even (one character jokes) Venus. The chapter also revolves around an attempted burglary of Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\" by Hugh Godolphin through the Venezuelan consulate.\n\nThe chapter begins with Benny Profane, freshly unemployed after being laid-off from sewer-alligator hunting, in search of a job in Manhattan. After briefly contemplating the nature of money on a park bench, he, by chance, looks at an advertisement issued by The Time/Space Employment Agency. Once arriving at the agency he finds, much to his annoyance, that the secretary is his former lover Rachel Owlglass. In section IV Stencil continues his investigation of the perplexing \"V.\" (whom he now believes is either Victoria or the rat Veronica) meeting up with a Yoyodyne engineer Kurt Mondaugen.\n\nKurt Mondaugen, who will appear again in \"Gravity's Rainbow\", is the central character in a story set in South-West Africa (now Namibia) partly during a siege in 1922 at which one Vera Meroving is present, but most notably in 1904, during the Herero Wars, when South-West Africa was a German colony.\n\nMcClintic Sphere, an alto sax player in a jazz band, returns home to his boarding house in Harlem. The previous week, spent playing primarily for condescending, snobby Ivy League students, has left him exhausted, and he relaxes in his room with a prostitute named Ruby. Benny, meanwhile, finally gets a job at Anthroresearch Associates, where he's introduced to SHROUD, a synthetic humanoid with whom he holds imaginary conversations. Pig Bodine and Roony Winsome get into a fight, based on Roony's suspicion that Pig is involved with his (Roony's) wife, Mafia. Meanwhile, Mafia aggressively pursues sex with Benny, who declines. Schoenmaker and Esther get into a few arguments because he says he wants to bring out her inner beauty by performing more plastic surgery on her. The chapter finishes out with the Whole Sick Crew hanging out in various places: Sheridan Square, the Rusty Spoon, Slab in front of his Cheese Danish No. 35 canvas. Stencil, looking for Rachel at her apartment, comes upon Paola who gives him the Confessions of Fausto Maijstral.\n\nFausto Maijstral, Maltese civilian suffering under the German bombardment and working to clear the rubble during World War II writes a long letter to his daughter Paola, who figures in the Benny Profane story; the letter comes into Stencil's hands. The letter includes copious quotations from Fausto's diary. Besides the place name Valletta, V. figures in the story as an old — or possibly not-so-old — woman crushed by a beam of a fallen building.\n\nRoony and Mafia continue fighting, so Roony meets up with McClintic at the V-Note, and they travel to Lenox, Massachusetts. Returning to Matilda's boardinghouse, they meet up with Ruby, who Roony recognizes as being a member of the Crew in disguise. Esther tells Slab she is pregnant. He wants to send her to Cuba to get an abortion, and raises the money by announcing his intentions and asking for money at a party the Crew is throwing in an abandoned warehouse. Roony's attempts to deal with his wife then take a dark turn, but he is saved by Pig. At an airport, Esther and Slab attempt to catch Esther a flight to Cuba, but meet some resistance. Paola, traveling with McClintic, reveals her true identity to him. He delivers the line, \"Keep cool, but care,\" considered the novel's central theme, as they drive off into the Berkshires.\n\nBenny loses his job at Anthroresearch Associates by sleeping in and not being at work to notify the attendant technician that several calamities have occurred in the lab. Rachel nudges him to get a new job, and says that she will find one for him herself. An amusing story unfolds about Benny and Pig during their \"Scaffold\" days. Benny, unable and unwilling to get work, instead takes a self-described vacation and chooses to spend his spare time at the Rusty Spoon. He gets drunk with Stencil, who relates the entirety his knowledge of V. as it stands to this point in the novel. Valletta being the last place on Stencil's journey to find information about V., he asks Benny to accompany him and Paola to the island. Benny and Stencil commit a robbery in perilous circumstances, and then, in late September, they embark for Malta with Paola on board the \"Susanna Squaducci\".\n\nIn this chapter V. is entranced by a young ballerina, Mélanie l'Heuremaudit. The story centers on a riotous ballet performance, almost certainly modeled in part on the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\". The performance centers on a virgin sacrifice by impalement. The young ballerina fails to wear her protective equipment and actually dies by impalement in the course of the performance; everyone assumes her death throes simply to be an uncharacteristically emotional performance.\n\nBenny and Pig Bodine have one last adventure with two girls, Flip and Flop, as they all get drunk and wander around Washington D.C.. There are two going away parties for Benny, and the chapter ends with Benny, Stencil, and Paola leaving for Malta aboard the \"Susanna Squaducci\" as the Crew looks on and says goodbye.\n\nAs the Royal Navy mass on Malta in the early stages of the Suez Crisis, Stencil arrives with Benny in tow, searching for Fausto Maijstral. (As always, Kilroy was here first, and Pynchon proposes a novel origin for the face: that Kilroy was originally a schematic for part of a band-pass filter.)\n\nThe last chapter is a flashback to Valletta when Stencil, Sr. was still alive. After World War I he is sent to Malta to observe the various crises going on involving the natives and their desire for independence. He is implored by Maijstral's wife (who is pregnant with Fausto) to relieve him of his duties as a double agent because she fears for his life. Stencil, Sr. meets Veronica Manganese or V and implicitly has sex with her (she is now largely made up of artificial limbs). It is revealed they had trysted in Florence after the riots. He finds out that Maijstral is having an affair with her as well.\n\nLinus Fairing is also working as a double agent for Stencil, and when he leaves for America, having tired of the life of a spy, Stencil's purpose for being in Malta is null.\n\nV releases Stencil from her auspices and Maijstral as well.\n\nStencil sails off into the Mediterranean and a waterspout blows the ship up into the air, then down into the depths, not too dissimilar from the conclusion of another American masterpiece, Moby-Dick, also a sailor's story.\n\n\n\n\"Time\" wrote \"In this sort of book, there is no total to arrive at. Nothing makes any waking sense. But it makes a powerful, deeply disturbing dream sense. Nothing in the book seems to have been thrown in arbitrarily, merely to confuse, as is the case when inept authors work at illusion. Pynchon appears to be indulging in the fine, pre-Freudian luxury of dreams dreamt for the dreaming. The book sails with majesty through caverns measureless to man. What does it mean? Who, finally, is V.? Few books haunt the waking or the sleeping mind, but this is one. Who, indeed?\"\n\nTony Tanner considered the novel an exploration of the plots individuals ascribe onto the ambivalent universe they have no choice but to confront, during a 20th century period in which genuine communication between individuals has been eroded and in which ambiguous societal forces are at work (intentionally or inadvertently) towards a state of entropy; \"SHROUD asks, \"\"Has it occurred to you there may be no more standards for crazy or sane, now that it's started?\" And Benny answers, \"What, for Christ's sake?\"\" What the 'it' is that has started (if there is an 'it'), what common process links remote imperialist incidents with contemporary automation, tourism, Hitler, and the Whole Sick Crew (if there is any linking common process) - this is what the whole book is about.\"\n\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", George Plimpton called Pynchon \"a young writer of staggering promise\", lauding his \"vigorous and imaginative style\", \"robust humor\" and \"tremendous reservoir of information\".\n\nIn 1964, the novel was awarded a William Faulkner Foundation Award for best debut novel.\n\nIn 2012 it emerged that there were multiple versions of \"V.\" in circulation. This was due to the fact that Pynchon's final modifications were made after the first edition was printed and thus were only implemented in the British, or Jonathan Cape, edition and the Bantam paperback. The fact was forgotten soon after in the U.S., so most US editions, including the newly released eBook, follow the first printing and are therefore unauthorized versions of the text, while the British editions, which follow the first edition printed by Jonathan Cape, contain Pynchon's final revisions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47551733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47551733", "title": "Video gaming in Kenya", "text": "Video gaming in Kenya\n\nVideo gaming is a young sector in Kenya. Though various start-up companies have appeared in the country since 2007, the existing businesses are dealing with funding issues and few successes have been made. However, shared spaces, support programs and government grants introduced over the past few years have allowed the industry to grow large in a short period of time. The introduction of broadband internet in 2009 spawned a generation of young ICT savvy people in the country and the Kenyan game industry is as of 2015 among the largest in Africa.\n\nThe earliest known game development in Kenya was around 2007, when independent game designer Wesley Kirinya worked alone on \"Adventures of Nyangi\", a \"crude\" action-adventure video game inspired by \"Tomb Raider\". Despite the game's low quality, it gained a large amount of press coverage for being among the first video games created on the African continent. Kirinya later joined with Ghanaian game developer Eyram Tawia to form the company Leti Games, which was rebranded as Leti Arts in 2013.\n\nIn November 2007, NexGen was formed, a company by video game enthusiasts Nathan Masyuko and Ayub Makimei. Inspired in the mid-'90s by the Nintendo Entertainment System and works of Hideo Kojima, Masyuko built a gaming center in 2009 from where the company hosts gaming tournaments. NexGen has been taking efforts to get esports off the ground in Kenya, with limited success. In 2010, Planet Rackus formed. The company released \"Ma3Racer\" on the Nokia Ovi Store, expecting around 10,000 downloads over a year, but the game became popular by its primarily African audience was downloaded over 900,000 times within that time span.\n\nKirinya and Masyuko have worked together with artist Chief Nyamweya to develop \"\", an Android game reaching 250,000 downloads and winning a World Youth Summit Award, which Masyuko collected in Montreal in 2012. \"Pamoji Mtaani\", developed by Warner Bros., won the Global Business Coalition’s Business Excellence Award in 2011 and globally recorded over a million sales after big names in the Kenyan music industry, such as Jua Cali and Kevin Wyre, were involved in its production.\n\nThough in 2007, there existed only a handful of retail stores predominantly selling video games, this number has gone up in recent years. In 2009, Kenya laid the first of its underseas fiber optic internet cables, bringing broadband internet within reach for the population. The government has since invested more money in the development of digital infrastructure, making online gaming viable. In 2010, iHub was created, a physical area for Kenyan ICT entrepreneurs to come together. Various other businesses followed suit, supporting start-up companies \"through a mix of entrepreneurship training, research, funding, working spaces and mentoring.\" According to Masyuko, these developments are \"shifting Kenya at a very unprecedented pace.\"\n\nThe first 3D video game developed in Africa was released by Black Division Games in June 2015. The game, titled \"Nairobi X\", achieved a large amount of international coverage due to its high graphical quality and because it was released for PC as well as Android devices.\nIn events, a young video game entertainment company called Gaming For Kenya otherwise known as G4k handled several major gaming events in the country as well as promoting the gaming culture. Their well known LAN parties, known as the \"1UP Elite\" LAN party, have gained momentum and amplified the social gaming culture in Kenya uniting gamers together to play with each other and have fun.\n\nThe Kenyan government plans to harness the technological progress of the country as part of its Vision 2030 plan, transforming the country into a \"globally competitive and prosperous nation.\" This plan also involves the construction of a \"Silicon Savannah,\" which is described as \"Africa's answer to Silicon Valley.\" Despite these plans, unemployment is common in Kenya, and a failed ICT project could leave a young person without a job to fall back on. The rise of game development is creating jobs in the region.\n\nForeign AAA video games sell for around US$100 in Kenya, making it impossible for the general public to purchase more than a handful of video games, though a rise in spending power has been noticed, with some young people buying high-end PCs valued US$17,000 and upward. An issue faced by ICT entrepreneurs is that gaming is not taken seriously by the general public, making it difficult to find financial support.\n\nAccording to Masyuko, African game development is mainly focused on mobile gaming, as this medium has the deepest penetration and the widest market. It is also considered an easier entry point as far as financing is concerned. However, Masyuko explains, \"[w]e don't have proper retail stores like the App Store ... if you want something you just go to this one-stop shop.\" Developers at University of Games state that console gaming is picking up in the country, though it is not as prevalent as the mobile market.\n\nMany cybercafes in Nairobi have a specific zone for people to play video games. These zones have proven to be more lucrative than charging for web browsing. Kenya's video game industry was estimated to be worth US$44 million at the end of 2013.\n\nIn eSports, there are roughly established bodies governing eSports events with the likes of the high-quality event Pro Series Gaming(P.S.G)\", the Tekken 254 Circuit\", the Pan African Gaming Union(P.A.G.U) Championships, Rise To Greatness - RIIG League\" and other minor tournaments such as the Kenya International Gaming Series dubbed as \"K.IN.G.S\" the Vivid Gold ePlay Tournaments, KAGE and many more. So far the Pro Series Gaming has been the most dominant eSports company in Kenya and over East and Central Africa hosting countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia and Malawi. Tekken 254 usually has a regular league called the Tekken 254 Circuit that runs every month until a full seasonal circuit is over as pro gamers await for the next season. The PAGU Championships, sponsored by Gaming For Kenya and other various entities is held throughout Africa with several countries that have membership to PAGU such as Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Zambia and other member countries. RIIG League is done occasionally is sponsored by the Holos Gaming Matrix(HGM) on the Xbox franchise.\n\nA new culture has also been adopted whereby some gamers in Kenya have started their own YouTube and Twitch.tv channels. Regionally, they are the most known gaming YouTubers, using this platform to connect with their audience and building a following.\n\nAccording to Brian Kinyua from four-man team University of Games, games offer an environment in which players can tackle social problem by themselves, without a \"mob to back you up [or] peers to cheer you on.\" Kinyua beliefs that the idea of solving societal issues with gaming should be taken more serious. University of Games released \"Election Thief\" in 2013 which promotes peace through a fictional story of attempted electoral fraud, inspired by the 2007 Kenyan election. \"Haki: Shield and Defend\" as well as its sequel \"\", similarly attempt to promote social messages such as saving trees from illegal logging and practicing peace and tolerance during Kenyan elections.\n\nLeti Arts commonly does contract development for serious games, usually for companies that are interested in educating their employees or creating learning tools. Nairobi-based studio Momentum Core has specialized in developing games for educational purposes, such as games raising awareness for HIV and education games for children.\n\nKenyan developers are mostly interested in making what they call \"African games.\" According to Kirinya, what is important is that Kenyan games should tap into African cultural heritage, such as using traditional African weaponry rather than guns or medieval armor. There are also various thematic styles associated with Africa.\n"}

The protagonist's girlfriend, Violet, threatens to leave otherwise. The protagonist faces a stream of distractions, including a window with a view of the campus, and a computer with access to blogs and webcomics.\nIn the course of the game, the protagonist must \"reconsider—and risk wrecking—\" his career and relationship.\n\nA reviewer for \"The A.V.

A second review also observes this option, noting that at least one puzzle changes based on the choice.\n\nA writer for Jay Is Games called out \"Violet\" for \"succeed[ing] in the difficult task of capturing the intricacies of a dynamic relationship.\" The writer also praised the game for succeeding at engaging the player at \"the core emotional level\", again noting how difficult this is. Emily Short, in a review on Jay Is Games, noted the strength of the implementation, pointing to the breadth of \"interesting responses even to silly or unexpected actions.\" Short felt that the characters were \"seemingly-real\" and \"their problem is plausible and serious.\"\n\n"}

A sequel was released for PC and Macintosh entitled Voyeur II, and a finished beta version of the sequel for Philips CD-I has been discovered and distributed on various abandonware sites.\n\nReviewing the Macintosh version, a \"Next Generation\" critic remarked derisively on the limited interactivity of full motion video based games, but said that \"Voyeur\" is a superior game by the standards of its genre due to the solid acting. He gave it two out of five stars.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the CD-i version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Although it won't appeal to action fans, this title has enough depth and replay value to be a valuable addition to any CD-i library.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "9741899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9741899", "title": "Youxia", "text": "Youxia\n\nYouxia (, ) was a type of ancient Chinese warrior folk hero celebrated in classical Chinese poetry and fictional literature. It literally means \"wandering vigilante\", but is commonly translated as \"knight-errant\" or less commonly as \"cavalier\", \"adventurer\", \"soldier of fortune\" or \"underworld stalwart\".\n\nOf the two characters of the term, \"yóu\" (遊) literally means to \"wander\", \"travel\" or \"move around\", and \"xiá\" (俠) means someone with power who helps others in need. The term refers to the way these men solely travelled the land using physical force or political influence to right the wrongs done to the common people by the powers that be, often judged by their personal codes of chivalry. \"Youxia\" did not come from any social class in particular. Various historical documents, wuxia novels and folktales describe them as being princes, government officials, poets, musicians, physicians, professional soldiers, merchants, monks and even humble farmers and butchers. Some were just as handy with a calligraphy brush as others were with swords and spears.\n\nAccording to Dr. James J. Y. Liu (1926–1986), a professor of Chinese and comparative literature at Stanford University, it was a person's temperament and need for freedom, and not their social status, that caused them to roam the land and help those in need. Dr. Liu believes this is because a very large majority of these knights came from northern China, which borders the territory of \"northern nomadic tribes, whose way of life stressed freedom of movement and military virtues\". Many knights seem to have come from Hebei and Henan provinces. A large majority of the characters from the \"Water Margin\", which is considered one of China's best examples of knight-errant literature, come from these provinces.\n\nOne good example of Youxia poetry is \"The Swordsman\" （剑客） by Jia Dao (Tang Dynasty):\n\nAccording to Dr. Liu, Jia’s poem \"seems...to sum up the spirit of knight-errantry in four lines. At the same time, one can also take it as a reflection of the desire of all those who have prepared themselves for years to put their abilities to the test for some justice.\"\n\n\n\n"}
