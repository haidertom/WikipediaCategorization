(A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in postmodern theory is a fragment by Nietzsche, entitled \"On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.\")\n\nFor example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the Venus of Willendorf and the women in the paintings of Rubens would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, body modification among \"primitive\" peoples is sometimes regarded as grotesque by Western society. \n\nAesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the \"external world\", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his \"radical scepticism\" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.\n\nPhilosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose \"nativist\" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).\n\nThe most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal. \n"}

Plato adhered to this idea and it was an important component of most Neoplatonic systems:\n\nTherefore, we may consequently state that: this world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.\n\nThe Stoics believed it to be the only vital force in the universe. Similar concepts also hold in systems of eastern philosophy in the Brahman-Atman of Hinduism, the Buddha-Nature in Mahayana Buddhism, and in the School of Yin-Yang, Taoism, and Neo-Confucianism as \"qi\".\n\nOther resemblances can be found in the thoughts of hermetic philosophers like Paracelsus, and by Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, Friedrich Schelling and in Hegel's \"Geist\" (\"Spirit\"/\"Mind\"). Ralph Waldo Emerson published \"The Over-Soul\" in 1841, which was influenced by the Hindu conception of a \"universal soul\". There are also similarities with ideas developed since the 1960s by Gaia theorists such as James Lovelock.\n\nIn Jewish mysticism, a parallel concept is that of \"Chokhmah Ila'ah,\" the all-encompassing \"Supernal Wisdom\" that transcends, orders and vitalizes all of creation. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended (or perhaps \"channeled\") by a perfect tzaddik (holy man). Thus, the tzaddik attains \"cosmic consciousness\" and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6770481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6770481", "title": "Aparigraha", "text": "Aparigraha\n\nIn Hinduism and Jainism, aparigraha () is the virtue of non-possessiveness, non-grasping or non-greediness.\n\nAparigrah is the opposite of \"parigrah\", and refers to keeping the desire for possessions to what is necessary or important, depending on one's life stage and context. The precept of \"aparigraha\" is a self-restraint (temperance) from the type of greed and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.\n\nAparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of dāna (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.\n\nAparigraha is a compound in Sanskrit, made of \"\"a-\" and \"parigrah\". The prefix \"a-\"\" means \"non-\", so \"\"aparigrah\" is the opposite of \"parigrah\"\", so \"aparigraha\" is speech and actions that oppose and negate \"parigraha.\"\n\nThe word \"parigrah\" means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others. The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes. The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first \"tirthankara\" in Jainism, Rishabhdeva.\n\nMonier-Williams states that the word \"parigraha\" has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something. In the Brahmanas and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others. In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.\n\nThe virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as \"abstaining from accepting gifts\", \"not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person\", and \"not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted\". The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness, and non-possessiveness. Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of \"letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears\" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.\n\nAparigraha is one of the virtues in Jainism. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (\"Śrāvaka\") and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (\"parimita-parigraha\") and limiting one’s desires (\"iccha-parimana\").\n\nIn Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires. Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy. Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence. Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life. After ahiṃsā, Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.\n\nIn the Yoga Sūtras (II.30), \"aparigraha\" is listed as the fifth Yamas or code of self-restraint, after with Ahimsa (nonviolence), Satya (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), Asteya (not stealing), and Brahmacharya (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).\n\nAparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (\"yamas\", \"the don'ts\") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (\"niyamas\", \"the dos\") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten \"yamas\" and \"niyamas\", these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts. It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.\n\nJames Wood states, \"aparigraha\" is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in \"acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them\". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature. Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,\n\nRestraint from possessiveness and greed, or \"aparigraha\", leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins. The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of Sādhanā, path of spiritual existence. In outer world, \"aparigraha\" manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.\n\nSome suggest \"aparigraha\" implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.\n\nScholars suggest \"aparigraha\" allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.\n\nAsteya is also one of the five vows taken by Jain ascetic monks to attain liberation. It is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else. Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.\n\n"}
{"id": "27954947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27954947", "title": "Apeiron", "text": "Apeiron\n\nApeiron (; ) is a Greek word meaning \"(that which is) unlimited,\" \"boundless\", \"infinite\", or \"indefinite\" from \"a-\", \"without\" and \"peirar\", \"end, limit\", \"boundary\", the Ionic Greek form of \"peras\", \"end, limit, boundary\". It is akin to Persian \"piramon\", meaning \"boundary, circumference, surrounding\".\n\nThe \"apeiron\" is central to the cosmological theory created by Anaximander, a 6th-century BC pre-Socratic Greek philosopher whose work is mostly lost. From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (\"arche\") is eternal and infinite, or boundless (\"apeiron\"), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived. \"Apeiron\" generated the opposites (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world (cf. Heraclitus). Everything is generated from \"apeiron\" and then it is destroyed by going back to \"apeiron\", according to necessity. He believed that infinite worlds are generated from \"apeiron\" and then they are destroyed there again.\n\nHis ideas were influenced by the Greek mythical tradition and by his teacher Thales (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws. The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word \"nomos\" (law) may originally have meant \"natural law\" and used later to mean man-made law.\n\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted \"apeiron\" as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing mythical way of thought to the newer rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek city states during the 6th century BC.\n\nIn the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC) the first primordial god is Chaos, which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between Tartarus and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation). One can name it also abyss (having no bottom).\n\nAlternately, Greek philosopher Thales believed that the origin or first principle was water. Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BC) probably called the water also \"Chaos\" and this is not placed at the very beginning.\n\nIn the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology Enuma Elish describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in Genesis.\nIn the Hindu cosmogony which is similar to the Vedic (Hiranyagarbha) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.\n\nHesiod made an abstraction, because his original \"chaos\" is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in Homer (indefinite sea). A fragment from Xenophanes (6th century BC) shows the transition from \"chaos\" to \"apeiron\": \"The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)\". Either \"apeiron\" meant the \"spatial indefinite\" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration. His ideas may have been influenced by the Pythagoreans:\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making \"apeiron\" the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap between the existing \"mythical\" and the new \"rational\" way of thought (\"rationalism\"). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, water, air, fire, earth, which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod). Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.\n\nThere is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales: \"What is divine? What has no origin, nor end.\" This probably led his student to his final decision for \"apeiron\", because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \"arche\" is called \"eternal and ageless\" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).\n\nThe \"apeiron\" has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.\nOut of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars. The first animals were generated in the water. When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish. The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.\n\nIn the commentary of Simplicius on Aristotle's \"Physics\" the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:\n\nThis fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms, meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess \"Justice\" (Dike), appears to keep the order. The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word \"dike\" (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour. The word \"adikia\" (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb \"law and order\" (\"eunomia\"). In Homer's \"Odyssey\" \"eunomia\" is contrasted with \"hubris\" (arrogance). Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a \"city-state\".\n\nAetius (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:\n\nTherefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about \"apeiron\" and this is also noticed by Aristotle:\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including Martin Heidegger.\n\nWerner Heisenberg, noted for the creation of quantum mechanics, arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same \"primordial substance\". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague Max Born called this substance \"apeiron\".\n\nScholars in other fields, e.g. Bertrand Russell and Maurice Bowra, didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term \"apeiron\", but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.\n\nThere are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. \"Apeiron\" is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant \"nothingless\". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from \"apeiron\" must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.\n\nJustice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.\n\nWe may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with \"apeiron\" is metaphysical (and can lead to monism), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical. The same paradox existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (\"hubris\" or \"adikia\") could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (\"dike\") would destroy him to reestablish the order. These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers. Philolaus (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ( \"apeira\", plural of \"apeiron\") and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (\"apeiron\") and the limited. Something similar is mentioned by Plato: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.\n\nSome doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: \"God ordained that all men shall die\", \"Death is a common debt\". The Greek word \"adikia\" (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits hubris. The relative English word \"arrogance\" (claim as one's own without justification; ), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: \"Nothing in excess.\"\n\nOther pre-Socratic philosophers had different theories of the \"apeiron\". For the Pythagoreans (in particular, Philolaus), the universe had begun as an \"apeiron\", but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts. For Anaxagoras, the initial \"apeiron\" had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike \"Nous\" (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same \"apeiron\", all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.\n\n\n"}

Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the semantic web.\n\nThe challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a world view orthogonal to epistemology. The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by \"applied\") or on knowing. This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like Fernando Flores and Martin Heidegger.\n\nOne way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of \"speech acts\": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing. The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology. This can involve concepts championed by ordinary language philosophers like Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nApplying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions. The context or clearing is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of being itself. This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of phenomenology, the works of Heidegger, and others.\nSocial scientists adopt a number of ontological approaches. Some of these are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17102646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17102646", "title": "Architectural design values", "text": "Architectural design values\n\nArchitectural design values make up an important part of what influences architects and designers when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different architectural movements. It also differs between different schools of architecture and schools of design as well as among individual architects and designers.\n\nThe differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the pluralism in design outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.\n\nDifferent design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.\n\nThe expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse aesthetic reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: Modernism, Postmodernism, Deconstructivism, Post-structuralism, Neoclassicism, New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc. All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements. Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking, but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.\n\nThese aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.\n\nA number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.\n\nAesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.\n\nIt is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing. These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like Expressionism and the Avant-garde art. Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.\n\nThis design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The Spirit of the Times denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era, which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, collective consciousness and unconsciousness. Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.\n\nStructural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc. Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “form follows function”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties, and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for. Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.\n\nThis design value is based on the idea that simple forms, i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom. This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.\n\nThis design value is based on the idea that nature (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs. Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.\n\nThis value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates. Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product. This design value is also linked to regional differences i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.\n\nThis design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place. In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area. In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.\n\nMany architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population. Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.\n\nIt should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. Social design values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.\n\nThe Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.\n\nThis design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design. This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs. Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.\n\nThis design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve stakeholders in the design process. This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:\n\nThis design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels, which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: \n\nThis is based on an eagerness to help developing countries through architecture and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the Third World). This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.\n\nThe 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies. Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.\n\nEnvironmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on environmental design has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques. In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental high-tech architecture, and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.\n\nEnvironmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce \"eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability\". This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related. However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.\n\nThe environmental design values category consists of three design values.\n\nThis value is based on a belief that a sustainable and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations. Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.\n\nThis is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates. Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.\n\nThis design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a healthy living environment. Built into this design value, are principles like: buildings should be freestanding; sites need to be distributed to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches individual structures. Similarly, there is an emphasis on health based construction and reduction of toxic emissions through selection of appropriate materials.\n\nWithin both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.\n\nThis design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as Classicism, Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.\n\nThe Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.\n\nThis relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs. Within this design value there are three main strategies:\n\nThis is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations. This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives. These are: \n\nThis value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity. The design value of Vernacular includes key concept such as: \n\nThis design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries. Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design, which are: \n\nDesigners that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment. It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.\n\nMany architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.\n\nThis is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'. This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours. Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: \n\nThe 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.\n\nIt is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.\n\nThe novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as Modernism, with is emphasis on “starting from zero”. The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges. However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.\n\nThe design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not. Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.\n\nA movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of Christopher Alexander in the 1960s, \"Notes on the synthesis of form\". Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's Space syntax and Michael Batty's work on Spatial analysis. In architecture, the four-volume work The Nature of Order by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example A Theory of Architecture is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia. This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.\n\nSocial and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of biophilia developed by E. O. Wilson plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the Biophilia hypothesis, and in by Nikos Salingaros and others in the book \"Biophilic Design\".\n\n"}

Aristotle, in \"The Poetics\", saw the role of the actor somewhat differently, suggesting that by witnessing \"pity and fear\" (in his view the essence of tragedy) on stage, an audience could experience a catharsis of the emotions associated with real tragic events, without having to experience them as first-hand participants.\n\nSince then, the 'stand-off' between those who have seen art as having a direct impact on morality, and those who have asserted its independence, has persisted. Tolstoy was ambivalent about the role of the artist (despite being one himself). In \"What is Art?\" he castigated now-canonical artists such as Shakespeare, Goethe and Wagner for failing to express the 'simple truths' about morality (as he saw them), opting instead to show off their poetic cleverness. He saw their work as morally reprehensible, effectively a wasting of their talents through their failure to communicate moral truth to the masses.\n\nSince the late nineteenth century and beyond, with the development of 'the Arts' as a cultural concept, the debate about art and morality has intensified, with the ever more challenging activities of artists becoming targets for those who see art as an influence for bad or good, and it has been a mainstay of many art critics' negative reviews. John Ruskin accused Whistler of \"flinging a pot of paint in the face of the audience\", and several of the ballets of Diaghilev scandalised audiences with their explicit (at the time) sexual themes.\n\nWhistler and Ruskin eventually went face-to-face in the courtroom. But in 1961, one of the most famous legal clashes between art and morality occurred when Penguin Books were taken to court over their publication of D. H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\". Similarly, in 1977 the Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse successfully sued a magazine, \"Gay News\", under blasphemous libel laws. \n\nIn popular culture, pornography (if seen in aesthetic terms) is used as an example of the objectification of women, and violent films have been cited as the influence for so-called \"copycat\" acts in reality. An example of this was the Hungerford Massacre, where a gunman was alleged by the tabloid press to have been influenced by the \"Rambo\" series of films starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nIn September 2001, shortly after the World Trade Center Attack, the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen said of the atrocity that it was \"Lucifer's greatest work of art.\" (However, Stockhausen's comments were taken out of context and misunderstood.) The responses were immediate and extreme, fuelled once again by the tabloid press. Some have found, here and elsewhere, art in the service of morality to be politically dangerous.\n\nIn purely philosophical terms, the precise nature of art's links with morality have been long been questioned. Some have found no link between the aesthetic and the moral (i.e. being morally reprehensible does not deny an artwork its art status; it does not cease having aesthetic value no matter how depraved some might see it being), whereas others, who have not gone down the explicitly Platonist route, have argued that the relationship is one akin to supervenience. Here, it is argued that an essential component of the production of art, the human factor, can only be made sensible if taken along with the perceived moral codes which govern humanity.\n"}
{"id": "9056282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9056282", "title": "Asceticism in Judaism", "text": "Asceticism in Judaism\n\nAsceticism is a term derived from the Greek verb ἀσκέω, meaning \"to practise strenuously,\" \"to exercise.\" Athletes were therefore said to go through ascetic training, and to be ascetics.\n\nIn this usage the twofold application—to the mode of living and the results attained—which marks the later theological implication of the term is clearly discernible. From the arena of physical contests the word easily passed over to that of spiritual struggles, and pre-Christian writers speak of the \"askesis\" of the soul or of virtue—the discipline of the soul, or the exercise in virtue. But the physical idea, no less than the moral, underlies the meaning of the term in medieval Christian parlance. The monastery, as the place where the required life of abstemiousness is lived under rigorous regulation and discipline, becomes the \"asketerion,\" a word which to the classical Greek conveyed only the notion of a place reserved for physical exercise; while the monks were the \"ascetikoi,\" the ascetics, under discipline attaining unto the perfect practise.\n\nAsceticism is indigenous to the religions which posit as fundamental the wickedness of this life and the corruption under sin of the flesh. Buddhism, therefore, as well as Christianity, leads to ascetic practices. Monasteries are institutions of Buddhism no less than of Catholic Christianity. The assumption, found in the views of the Montanists and others, that concessions made to the natural appetites may be pardoned in those that are of a lower degree of holiness, while the perfectly holy will refuse to yield in the least to carnal needs and desires, is easily detected also in some of the teachings of Gautama Buddha. The ideal of holiness of both the Buddhist and the Christian saint culminates in poverty and chastity; i.e., celibacy. Fasting and other disciplinary methods are resorted to curb the flesh.\n\nUnder a strict construction of the meaning of Asceticism, it is an error to assume that its history may be extended to embrace also certain rites in vogue among devotees to fetishism and nature worship. Mutilations, the sacrifice of the hair, dietary observances and prohibitions, which abound in all forms of religion at a certain stage of development, do not spring from the notion of the sinfulness of the natural instincts and of life. Nor is the sacrificial scheme in any way connected with Asceticism. The idea of privation is foreign to it. If the offering was a gift to the Deity and as such entailed upon the offerer the parting with something of value, the expectation which animated him was invariably that of receiving rich return. But whatever theory must be accepted in explanation of the various rites of mutilation, and of the sacrificial ritual, certain it is that Judaism from the beginning set its face most sternly against the one, and materially restricted the other. Mutilations for whatever purpose and of whatever character were absolutely prohibited. Funeral horrors and superstitions were not tolerated. The Levitical code restricted sacrifices to one place. The priests only were entrusted with the office at the altar. And, if the Prophets are the truest expounders of the ideals and ideas of the religion of Israel, even the sacrificial and sacerdotal system, with its implications of extraordinary and precautionary cleanliness and physical abstemiousness, was of little vital moment.\n\nFasting, which plays so essential a part in the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only in the development of the Day of Atonement. The Prophets, again, had little patience with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. Isaiah (lviii.), while appealing for a broader charity and deeper sense of justice, maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the Hafṭarah for the Day of Atonement, the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.\n\nNevertheless, fasting among the Jews was resorted to in times of great distress. The Book of Esther, of late date, illustrates this for the period included in the Biblical canon. Rabbinical sources prove the growing tendency to abstain from drink and food whenever memories of disaster marked the days of the synagogal calendar, or instant danger threatened the community. In the scheme of the synagogue the one fast-day of the Bible received no less than twenty-two as companions (compare Fasting in Judaism).\n\nStill, it may be doubted whether this multiplication of fast-days can be taken as a sign of an increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of Robertson Smith (\"The Religion of the Semites,\" p. 413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly it does for the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to eat too late a meal on the eve of the Sabbath-day, so as to enjoy all the more that of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).\n\nAmong the Rabbis some are mentioned as great and consistent fasters. Rabbi Zeira especially is remembered for his fondness of this form of piety. Yet to make of him an ascetic would be inaccurate. He fasted that he might forget his Babylonian method of teaching before emigrating to Palestine (B. M. 85a). The story continues that he abstained from drink and food for the period of one hundred days, in order that hell-fire might later have no power over him. Simon ben YoḦai is depicted as an ascetic in the traditions preserved in rabbinical literature. But exposed to persecutions under the Hadrian régime, and often in danger of his life, his whole mind was of an exceptionally somber turn for a Jewish teacher. Moreover, his ascetic practices were not inspired by a consciousness of the futility of this life and its sinfulness, but by the anxiety to fulfill to the letter the Law, to \"ponder on the Torah day and night\". He begrudged the hours necessary for the care of the body as so many precious moments stolen from the study of the holy Law. He envied the generation of the desert who had been fed on heavenly manna, and were thus absolved from the care for their daily bread; an echo of this sentiment may be detected in the petition of Jesus for daily bread (on Simon b. YoḦai, see W. Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" ii. 70-149).\n\nStill, with all these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not encourage \"individual\" fasting. The \"community\" in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, and it was the duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people (Ta'an. 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the Nazir's (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice (Num. vi. 11). Rabbi Zeira would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy (Yer. Ber. ii. 5d).\n\nThe attempt has been made to explain the Biblical Nazarites as forerunners of monastic orders addicted to the practice of ascetic discipline. Pentateuchal legislation concerning them shows them to have been merely tolerated. Modern criticism explains their peculiarities as arising from motives other than those that determine the conduct of ascetics. The Biblical Nazirs, forerunners of the Nebi'im (Prophets), were Protestants against the adoption of the customs and the religious rites of the Canaanites. In their dress and mode of life they emphasized their loyalty to YHVH, enthroned on the desert mountain. Wine and the crown of hair were sacred to the gods of the land. Their very appearance emphasized their rejection of the new deities. And in later days the number of those that took the Nazarite vow was exceedingly small. One is inclined to the opinion that no case occurred in which the Pentateuchal provisions became effective.\n\nNor may the Essenes be classed among the order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to lend support to the theory that would class them as such, their fundamental doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.\n\nA stronger case against the theory that Judaism is a very uncongenial soil for the growth of Asceticism might be made out by an appeal to the later Jewish mystics, the Ḥasidim and Cabalists of various forms, all ecstatic fantastics, and—this is a point that must not be overlooked—more or less strongly under the influence of distinctly non-Jewish conceits. See below, Examples of Jewish Asceticism.\n\nLooking upon this life as essentially good, according to Gen. i. 31; upon the human body as a servant of the spirit, and therefore not corrupt; upon the joys of earth as God-given and therefore to be cherished with gratitude toward the divine giver; having a prayer for every indulgence in food and drink; a benediction for every new experience of whatever nature, gladsome or sad—the Jew partook with genuine zest of the good cheer of life, without, however, lapsing into frivolity, gluttony, or intemperance. His religion, that taught him to remember his dignity as one made in the image of God, and to hold his body in esteem as the temple of God's spirit within, a dwelling of the Most Holy, \"a host,\" as Hillel put it, \"for the guest, the soul,\" kept the Jew equidistant from the pole of self-torturing pessimism, from the mortification of the flesh under the obsession of its sinfulness and foulness, and from the other pole of levity and sensuousness.\n\nNever intemperate in drink or food, he sought and found true joy in the consecration of his life and all of its powers and opportunities to the service of his God, a God who had caused the fruit of the vine to grow and the earth to give forth the bread, a God who created the light and sent the darkness, a God who, as a Talmudical legend—one of the many with Elijah for their subject—has it, reserves paradise \"for them that cause their fellows to laugh\" (Ta'an. 22a). The most beautiful saying of the rabbis about Asceticism is: \"Man will have to give account in the future for every lawful enjoyment offered to him which he has ungratefully refused\" (Rab in Yer. Ḳid., at the close); compare TanḦ., end, \"The wicked in his life is considered as one dead,\" etc.\n\nWhile the dominant note of Judaism is optimism, faith in a God who delights in the happiness of His creatures and expects their grateful appreciation of His bounties—see Abstinence in Judaism—there have, nevertheless, been prevalent in Jewish life certain ascetic tendencies of which the historian must take account.\n\nThe two great rabbinical schools of the first pre-Christian century, the Shammaites and the Hillelites, debated the question whether life was worth living or not—\"ṭob le-adam shenibra mishelo nibra\" (Er. 13b), and there was an unmistakable element of austerity in the teaching of many a Shammaite that favored asceticism (compare II Esdras iv. 12). While one teacher would say, \"The Shekinah rests on man only amid cheerfulness that comes from duty well performed\" (Pes. ii. 7a), another held the view that \"there should be no unrestrained laughter in this world\" (Ber. 31a).\n\nBut it was particularly with the view of fitting the soul for communion with God, or for the purpose of keeping the body sufficiently pure to allow it to come into contact with sacred objects, that many strove to avoid things that either cause intoxication or Levitical impurity, the drinking of wine (Lev. x. 9; Num. vi. 3; Amos ii. 12; Judges xiii. 14), or sexual intercourse, which was forbidden to the people of Israel, in preparation for the Sinai Revelation (Ex. xix. 15), and to Moses during the life of communion with God (Deut. ix. 9, 18; I Sam. xxi. 5; Shab. 87a).\n\nAccording to this principle the life of the ancient Ḥasidim or Perushim (Pharisees) and Ẓenu'im (Essenes) was regulated. At the same time these devotees of holiness, making \"askesis\" (the practise of fortitude) their special object of life, were naturally led to view sensual life as contaminating. F. C. Conybeare says: \"Philo's ideal was to die daily, to mortify the flesh with fasting; he only insisted that the seclusion from social life should take place at the age of fifty, the time when the Levites retired from the active duties of the Temple service\".\n\nThis was exactly the view of the Essenes and Therapeutæ also, in whatever connection they stood to Jonadab ben Rechab and the Kenites (see Mek., Yitro, 2, regarding \"the water-drinkers\" (shote mayim), as some of these are called). Banus, the eremite saint with whom Josephus passed three years of his life (Josephus, \"Vita,\" § 2), was certainly an ascetic. Likewise were John the Baptist (Matt. iii. 4 and parallels) and the early Christians, Paul included, insofar as they shunned marriage as a concession to the flesh (Matt. xix. 10-12; I Cor. vii. 28-38), imbued with ascetic views. It was exactly in opposition to this tendency, so marked in early Christianity, that the Talmudists denounced fasting and penitence (Ta'anit 11a, b) and accentuated the duty of cheerfulness in the Elijah legend (Ta'anit 22a). Upon the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in the year 70, a veritable wave of asceticism swept over the people, and in tribute to the national misfortune various ascetic rules were instituted (see B. B. 60b; Tosefta Soṭah, end; II Esdras ix. 24; compare W. Bacher, \"Agada der Tannaiten,\" i. 164).\n\nStill, mysticism, which goes hand in hand with asceticism, always had its esoteric circles. Judah ha-Nasi, called \"the saint,\" was an ascetic (Ket. 104a). Mar, the son of Rabina, fasted throughout the whole year with the exception of the holy days and the eve of the Atonement Day (Pes. 68b). For the sake of communing with the upper world, the lower one was despised by the elect few who preserved the tradition of the gnosis and the apocalyptic mysteries.\n\nSo did the followers of Obadiah Abu-Isa, the Isawites, and of Judah Yudghan, the Yudghanites, at the close of the 7th century and at the beginning of the 8th, the forerunners of the Karaites, and many prominent Karaites themselves lead ascetic lives; abstaining from meat and wine, and spending much of their time in meditation and devotion, partly in order to obtain a deeper knowledge of the Scriptures, partly as mourners over Jerusalem (see Shahrastani, \"Book of Religions and Philosophical Sects,\" Haarbrücker's translation, i. 254-257; H. Grätz, \"Gesch. der Juden,\" iii. 417 et seq., 446 et seq.; Jost, \"Gesch. des Judenthums,\" ii. 350 et seq.).\n\nTo some extent, therefore, all the mystics of the Middle Ages were Ascetics, assuming or accepting for themselves the title of \"Nazarites,\" or being called by their contemporaries \"saints.\" This is especially true of Abraham ben David of Posquières and his circle in the 13th century, whose relation to the beginnings of the Kabala can hardly be denied. Further, the currents of thought which, emanating from India, created Sufism in Persian and Mohammedan circles in the 12th and 13th centuries, exerted considerable influence upon Jewish thinkers, as may be learned from BaḦya, whose ethical system, \"Ḥobot ha-Lebabot,\" oscillates between asceticism and Jewish optimism, with a decided leaning to the former (see below).\n\nEven such thinkers as opposed the ascetic view could not extricate themselves entirely from the meshes of Neoplatonic mysticism, which beheld in the flesh or in matter the source of evil. Thus Abraham ben Ḥiyya strongly refutes the Neoplatonic conception of evil as being identical with matter, and maintains against BaḦya that indulgence in fasting and other modes of penitence is not meritorious, since only he who is ruled by his lower desires may resort to asceticism as the means of curbing his passion and disciplining his soul, whereas the really good should confine himself to such modes of abstinence as are prescribed by the Law.\n\nNevertheless, Abraham b. Ḥiyya claims a higher rank for the saint who, secluded from the world, leads a life altogether consecrated to the service of God. He goes even so far as to advocate the state of celibacy in such cases, referring to the example of Moses—who had to abandon intercourse with his wife when receiving the laws on Sinai—to the majority of the prophets (who were, as he thinks, unmarried), and to Ben Azzai (according to Yeb. 63b). Like BaḦya, he considers that the ascetic, while leading a purer and holier life, requires less legal restraint (see his \"Hegyon ha-Nefesh,\" ed. Reifman, 16a, 32a, 37a; Rosin, \"Ethik des Maimonides,\" pp. 15, 16; Moritz Güdemann, in \"Monatsschrift,\" 1900, pp. 196–216).\n\nOf Asher, the son of Meshullam ben Jacob in Lunel, Benjamin of Tudela (\"Travels,\" ed. Asher, 3b) relates as eye-witness that he was an ascetic (\"parush\") who did not attend to any worldly business, but studied day and night, kept fasts, and never ate meat. His brother Jacob bore the title of Nazarite, having also been an ascetic abstaining from wine (see Zunz's note in Asher's \"Benjamin of Tudela,\" ii. 11, 12; H. Grätz, \"Gesch. der Juden,\" vi. 240, 241).\n\nAlso the whole family of Judah the Ḧasid of Regensburg, of the 12th century, his father, Samuel, and his grandfather, Kalonymus of Speyer, grandson of Eliezer the Great of Worms, seem to have been a family of Ascetics (see H. J. Michael, \"Or ha-Ḥayyim,\" Nos. 433, 990, 1174, 1200).\n\nThe subsequent development and growth of the Kabala produced other forms of asceticism. In fact, the Ḥasid and the Ẓanua' of the medieval apocalyptic literature being a survival of Essenism, ablutions and fasting were resorted to by the adepts of the Cabala as means of attaining communion with the upper world. Some of these Ḥasidim would spend the whole week—without or with interruption, according to their physical endurance—in fasting, rendering only the Sabbath a day of comfort and joy. The object of their penitences and fastings was to bring about the time of divine favor, the Messianic era. Every Messianic movement had therefore Ascetics as leaders, such as were the Shabbethaians (see H. Grätz, \"Gesch. der Juden,\" iii. 307) and others (see Abraham ben Samuel Cohen of Lask). Others would refrain from eating animal food—'eber min ha-Ḥay—and, like the Buddhists or the Pythagoreans of old, live on vegetarian diet. The same is related by Epiphanius of the Dosithean sect.\n\nAgainst all these ascetic views and tendencies Maimonides raised his powerful voice, and his sober view maintained the upper hand. He admits the wholesome influence on those needing much discipline of the soul of fasting and vigils, of sexual and social abstemiousness, the self-torture of the hermit, and of the penitent who dwells in deserts and uses only coarse haircloth for the covering of his flesh; but he declares the constant use of what can at best be only a remedial measure in abnormal and unsound conditions of life to be a great folly and injurious extravagance.\n\nMaimonides, while adopting the Aristotelian maxim of the golden middle way in all things, finds in the various restrictions of the dietary and marriage laws of the Torah a legislative system of training the people to a sobriety which makes superfluous such asceticism as the monks and the saints of other nations indulge in; nay, sinful indeed, according to the rabbinical interpretation of Num. vi. 11, which says that the priest shall \"make an atonement for him [the Nazir] for that he has sinned against the person [in making his vow of abstinence]\" (see Ned. 10a; Maimonides, \"Yad,\" De'ot, iii. 1, vi. 1).\n\nJewish hermits, living in a state of celibacy and devoting themselves to meditation, are still (circa 1906) found among the Falashas. They claim that Aaron the high priest was the first Nazarite who from the time of his consecration separated from his wife to live only in the shadow of the tabernacle. Accordingly, they join the monastic order after they have been married and have become fathers of children (Halévy, \"Travels in Abyssinia,\" p. 230). According to Flad (\"Abyssinische Juden,\" pp. 32 et seq.), the order founded by Abba Sabra (Halévy, \"Abba Sura\") consists altogether of eunuchs. This would indicate non-Jewish influence, of which the Falashas show many traces.\n\n\n"}

Some philosophers believe causation relates facts, not events, in which case the meaning is adjusted accordingly.\n\nSome philosophers believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true, as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another, or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type (that is, the mass-energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic 'pattern' where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury, say). There may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists. The fact that certain events seem to 'cause' other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass-energy that exists in spacetime, which is ultimately either due OR an instantiation of the laws of physics. Note: Stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading, as one would have to Define what is meant by 'causality' - it may be that causality is dependent upon counterfactual definiteness, that is, A causes B because, if A did NOT occur, then B would not occur (i.e.: A is necessary for B) AND because A is sufficient for B. It may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept (if one rejects counterfactual definiteness for instance), but that causal chains are still a valid concept (as they would merely be chains of events).\n\n"}

{"id": "59604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59604", "title": "Epiphenomenon", "text": "Epiphenomenon\n\nAn epiphenomenon (plural: epiphenomena) is a secondary phenomenon that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two senses, one that connotes known causation and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.\n\nThe problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F. For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”. Suppose that C causes E necessarily and that C has an epiphenomenon F necessarily. We then have that if E had not occurred, then F would not have occurred, either. But then according to the counterfactual analysis of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of F on E is true; that is, on this view, E caused F. Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that E caused F), a counterfactual analysis seems to be insufficient.\n\nAn epiphenomenon can be an effect of primary phenomena, but cannot affect a primary phenomenon. In philosophy of mind, epiphenomenalism is the view that mental phenomena are epiphenomena in that they can be caused by physical phenomena, but cannot cause physical phenomena. In strong epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can \"only\" be caused by physical phenomena, not by other mental phenomena. In weak epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can be caused by both physical phenomena and other mental phenomena, but mental phenomena cannot be the cause of any physical phenomenon. \n\nThe physical world operates independently of the mental world in epiphenomenalism; the mental world exists as a derivative parallel world to the physical world, affected by the physical world (and by other epiphenomena in weak epiphenomenalism), but not able to have an effect on the physical world. Instrumentalist versions of epiphenomenalism allow some mental phenomena to cause physical phenomena, when those mental phenomena can be strictly analyzable as summaries of physical phenomena, preserving causality of the physical world to be strictly analyzable by other physical phenomena.\n\nIn the more general use of the word, a causal relationship between the phenomena is implied; the epiphenomenon is a consequence of the primary phenomenon. This is the sense that is related to the noun \"epiphenomenalism\".\n\nHowever, in medicine, this relationship is typically \"not\" implied, and the word is usually used in its second sense: an epiphenomenon may occur independently, and is called an epiphenomenon because it is not the primary phenomenon under study or because only correlation, not causation, is known or suspected. In this sense, saying that X is associated with Y as an epiphenomenon is preserving an acknowledgment that correlation does not imply causation. Signs, symptoms, syndromes (groups of symptoms), and risk factors can all be epiphenomena in this sense. For example, having an increased risk of breast cancer concurrent with taking an antibiotic is an epiphenomenon. It is not the antibiotic that is causing the increased risk, but the increased inflammation associated with the bacterial infection that prompted the taking of an antibiotic. The metaphor of a tree is one way of helping to explain the difference to someone struggling to understand. If the infection is the root of the tree, and the inflammation is the trunk, then the cancer and the antibiotic are two branches; the antibiotic is not the trunk.\n\nAlthough electronics is said to be due to the influence of electrons, the standard approach to the study of electrical phenomena due to James Clerk Maxwell views these particles as secondary:\nAccording to epiphenomenalism, free will having an effect on the physical world is an illusion, as physical phenomena can only be caused by other physical phenomena. In weak epiphenomenalism, there is free will to cause some mental effects, allowing for mental discipline that is directed at other mental phenomena.\n\nWeak versions of behaviorism in psychology admit the existence of mental phenomena but not their meaningful study as causes of observable behavior and view mental phenomena as either epiphenomena or linguistic summaries, instruments to examine objectively observable physical behavior.\n\nIn the field of complex systems, the term epiphenomenon tends to be used interchangeably with \"emergent effect\".\n\nZenon Pylyshyn suggested a propositional model of cognition where people do not conceptualize ideas in images but rather in meaningful relationships. In this theory, epiphenomena refer to images because they are merely products people conceptualize from their actual thought processes. Pylyshyn defends his claim by explaining that we only see images when we envision the form of an object. While visualizing objects or actions is a frequent process in our mind, it does not occur when we are considering the meaning behind an action or the non-visual properties of an object. There are many concepts we simply cannot envision. Additionally, when envisioning an image, it changes based on our preconceived notions, suggesting that semantic relations precede visual images. Unfortunately, the idea of epiphenomena in propositional theory is largely subjective and not falsifiable.\n"}

This approach views shareholders as the economic engine of the organization and the only group to which the firm must be socially responsible. As such, the goal of the firm is to maximize profits and return a portion of those profits to shareholders as a reward for the risk they took in investing in the firm. He advocates that the shareholders can then decide for themselves what social initiatives to take part in rather than having their appointed executive, whom they appointed for business reasons, decide for them.\n\nFriedman argued that a company should have no \"social responsibility\" to the public or society because its only concern is to increase profits for itself and for its shareholders and that the shareholders in their private capacity are the ones with the social responsibility. He wrote about this concept in his book \"Capitalism and Freedom\". In it he states that when companies concern themselves with the community rather than focusing on profits, it leads to totalitarianism.\n\nIn the book, Friedman writes: \"There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.\"\n\nThe idea of the stockholder theory, some argue, is inconsistent with the idea of corporate social responsibility at the cost of the stakeholder. For example, a company donating services or goods to help those hurt in a natural disaster, in some ways, may be considered not taking action in the best interest of the shareholder. Instead Friedman argues that shareholders should themselves decide how much and to whom they would like to make donations. Some may argue that goods provided to society in a time of need build further allegiance to a corporation and in theory, meet the stockholder theory's requirement to look in the best interest of the stockholder.\n\nThe Friedman doctrine is controversial. In left-wing social activist Naomi Klein's book \"The Shock Doctrine\", she criticizes the theory, saying most citizens become impoverished while corporate elites gain enormous wealth.\n"}
{"id": "1865924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865924", "title": "Geist", "text": "Geist\n\nGeist () is a German noun with a degree of importance in German philosophy. Its semantic field corresponds to English ghost, spirit, mind, intellect. Some English translators resort to using \"spirit/mind\" or \"spirit (mind)\" to help convey the meaning of the term. \n\n\"Geist\" is also a central concept in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's 1807 \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (\"Phänomenologie des Geistes\"). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of world history of the late 18th century, include Weltgeist \"world-spirit\", Volksgeist \"national spirit\" and Zeitgeist \"spirit of the age\".\n\nGerman \"Geist\" (masculine gender) continues Old High German \"geist\", attested as the translation of Latin \"spiritus\". \nIt is the direct cognate of English \"ghost\", from a West Germanic \"gaistaz\". Its derivation from a PIE root \"g̑heis-\" \"to be agitated, frightened\" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening (c.f. English ghastly) apparitions or ghosts, and may also have carried the connotation of \"ecstatic agitation, \"furor\"\" related to the cult of Germanic Mercury. \nAs the translation of biblical Latin \"spiritus\" (Greek πνεῦμα) \"spirit, breath\" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the Holy Spirit (Old English \"sē hālga gāst\" \"the Holy Ghost\", OHG \" ther heilago geist\", Modern German \"der Heilige Geist\").\nThe English word is in competition with Latinate \"spirit\" from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.\n\nThe German noun much like English \"spirit\" could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead, to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the \"spirit of wine\", i.e. ethanol. \nHowever, its special meaning of \"mind, intellect\" never shared by English \"ghost\" is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French \"esprit\".\nIn this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.\n\"Geist\" could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.\nIt is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of \"geistlich\" \"spiritual, pertaining to religion\" vs. \"geistig\" \"intellectual, pertaining to the mind\" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts is made by the adjective \"geisterhaft\" \"ghostly, spectral\".\n\nNumerous compounds are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as \"Geistesgegenwart\" = \"présence d'esprit\" (\"mental presence, acuity\"), \"Geistesabwesenheit\" = \"absence d’esprit\" (\"mental absence, distraction\"), \"geisteskrank\" \"mentally ill\", \"geistreich\" \"witty, intellectually brilliant\", \"geistlos\" \"unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous\" etc. \nIt is from these developments that certain German compounds containing \"-geist\" have been loaned into English, such as \"Zeitgeist\".\n\nGerman \"Geist\" in this particular sense of \"mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit\" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain \"Geist\" as a German loanword.\n\n\"Geist\" is a central concept in Hegel's \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (\"Phänomenologie des Geistes\"). According to Hegel, the \"Weltgeist\" (\"world spirit\") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history. \"Weltgeist\" is effected in history through the mediation of various \"Volksgeister\" (\"national spirits\"), the great men of history, such as Napoleon, are the \"concrete universal\".\n\nThis has led some to claim that Hegel favored the great man theory, although his philosophy of history, in particular concerning the role of the \"universal state\" (\"Universalstaat\", which means a universal \"order\" or \"statute\" rather than \"state\"), and of an \"End of History\" is much more complex.\n\nFor Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by \"Geist\" or \"absolute spirit\", by a \"ruse of reason\" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the teleological principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.\n\n\"Weltgeist\", the world spirit concept, designates an idealistic principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained objective reality as its product. (See metaphysical objectivism) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle all paid homage, amongst other things, to the concept of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.\n\n\"Weltgeist\" \"world-spirit\" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of \"secularism, impiety, irreligiosity\" (\"spiritus mundi\"), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of \"man of the world\", \"mundane or secular person\".\nAlso from the 17th century, \"Weltgeist\" acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of \"world-spirit\" or \"world-soul\" (\"anima mundi, spiritus universi\") in the sense of Panentheism, a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction between magnet and iron or between Moon and tide.\n\nThis idea of \"Weltgeist\" in the sense of \"anima mundi\" became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, \"der Geist\" on its own could refer to this concept, as in Christian Thomasius, \"Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes\" (1709).\nBelief in a \"Weltgeist\" as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of Goethe, in the later part of the 18th century.\n\nAlready in the poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the \"Weltgeist\" \nappears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of Nature.\n\n\"Weltgeist\" in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of God and can be attributed agency and will. \nHerder, who tended to prefer the form \"Weltengeist\" (as it were \"spirit of worlds\"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:\nThe term was notably embraced by Hegel and his followers in the early 19th century.\nFor the 19th century, the term as used by Hegel (1807) became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing world history:\n\nHegel's description of Napoleon as \"the world-soul on horseback\" (\"die Weltseele zu Pferde\") became proverbial.\nThe phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in a letter written on 13 October 1806, the day before the Battle of Jena, to his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer:\nI saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.\n\nThe letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.\nIt is used without attribution by Meyer Kayserling in his \"Sephardim\" (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in \"Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen\", who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's \"bad jokes\" (\"schlechte Witze\").\nThe phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century.\n\n\"Volksgeist\" or \"Nationalgeist\" refers to a \"spirit\" of an individual people (\"Volk\"), its \"national spirit\" or \"national character\".\nThe term \"Nationalgeist\" is used in the 1760s by Justus Möser and by Johann Gottfried Herder. The term \"Nation\" at this time is used in the sense of \"natio\" \"nation, ethnic group, race\", mostly replaced by the term \"Volk\" after 1800.\nIn the early 19th century, the term \"Volksgeist\" was used by Friedrich Carl von Savigny in order to express the \"popular\" sense of justice.\nSavigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an \"esprit des nations \" used by Voltaire. and of the \"esprit général\" invoked by Montesquieu.\n\nHegel uses the term in his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of History\".\nBased on the Hegelian use of the term, Wilhelm Wundt, Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal in the mid-19th-century established the field of \"Völkerpsychologie\" (\"psychology of nations\").\n\nIn Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, Schlegel and the Brothers Grimm. In the history of cultures, Herder. In the history of the State or political history, Hegel. In the field of law, Savigny and in the field of psychology Wundt. This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to Romanticism as it is commonly known.\nThe concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology George W. Stocking, Jr., \"… one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist.\"\n\nThe compound \"Zeitgeist\" (;, \"spirit of the age\" or \"spirit of the times\") similarly to \"Weltgeist\" describes \nan invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history.\nThe term is now mostly associated with Hegel, contrasting with Hegel's use of \"Volksgeist\" \"national spirit\" and \"Weltgeist\" \"world-spirit\", \nbut its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to Herder and Goethe.\nThe term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to a fashion or fad which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of architecture.\n\nHegel in \"Phenomenology of the Spirit\" (1807) uses both \"Weltgeist\" and \"Volksgeist\" but prefers the phrase \"Geist der Zeiten\" \"spirit of the times\" over the compound \"Zeitgeist\".\n\nHegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a \"free and ethical culture\".\n\nThe term has also been used more widely in the sense of an intellectual or aesthetic fashion or fad.\nFor example, Charles Darwin's 1859 proposition that evolution occurs by natural selection has been cited as a case of the \"zeitgeist\" of the epoch, an idea \"whose time had come\", seeing that his contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, was outlining similar models during the same period. \nSimilarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of logical positivism in the 1920s, leading to a focus on behaviorism and blank-slatism over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s, the shift from behaviorism to post-modernism and critical theory can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic \"zeitgeist\".\n\"Zeitgeist\" in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his \"theory of leadership\" and in other publications describing models of business or industry.\nMalcolm Gladwell argued in his book \"Outliers\" that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.\n\n\n\n"}

These events have long been important in parts of East Africa, as ways to build and maintain communities.\n\nFollowing Kenya's independence in 1963, the first Prime Minister, and later first President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta adopted \"Harambee\" as a concept of pulling the country together to build a new nation. He encouraged communities to work together to raise funds for all sorts of local projects, pledging that the government would provide their startup costs. Under this system, wealthy individuals wishing to get into politics could donate large amounts of money to local harambee drives, thereby gaining legitimacy; however, such practices were never institutionalised during Kenyatta's presidency.\n\nA popular etymology deriving the term from the name of a Hindu goddess, \"Amba Mata\" (a form of Durga riding a Tiger) has been proposed, supposedly via Hindu railway linesmen carrying loads of iron rails and sleeper blocks who would chant \"har, har Ambe!\" (\"praise Amba\") when working.\n\nThe first president, Jomo Kenyatta has been said to have witnessed such a railway line team as it worked in cohesion and harmony and derived the term from there. The actual etymology of the term is, however, cited as genuinely Bantu, from the Miji Kenda term \"halumbe\" \"to pull or push together\". \n\nThe word \"Harambee\" and the concept of \"harambee\" funds-drives have received criticism. The word was originally adopted by Jomo Kenyatta into the Kenyan philosophy to mean \"pulling together\" or cooperating in community projects. \n\nDue to repeated abuse, the word \"Harambee\" is often perceived to refer to manipulative or deceptive collection of monetary funds from the public. \n\n\"Harambee\" funds drives have been repeatedly abused through:-\n\nKenyan Christians have criticised the use of the word \"Harambee\" as an official term due to its apparent hindu origin. \"Harambee\" is neither a Hindu god nor a hindu word; it is a Swahili word and Kenyan. The objections have also been dismissed on the basis that even if the supposed derivation from \"Hare Ambeh\" (Hail Ambeh) were true, it has become irrelevant to the term's modern usage and meaning.\n\nIn January 2002, the Risk Advisory Group Ltd commissioned by President Moi's administration as part of the anti-corruption efforts recommended the abolition of \"harambee\" or the \"spirit of pulling together\".\n\nIn 2003 when the National Rainbow Coalition NARC took over from the Kenya African National Union KANU, President Mwai Kibaki enacted the Public Officers Ethics Act which prohibited Members of Parliament and Cabinet Secretaries from presiding over \"Harambees\".\n\nIn February 2018, a petition was presented to the Kenyan Parliament, Senate, seeking to have the word \"HARAMBEE\" removed from the Public Seal on the claim that it represents a Hindu Goddess .\n\n\n"}

Although many scholars in the field are trained primarily as either historians or as philosophers, there are degree-granting departments of HPS at several prominent universities (see below).\n\nThe organization &HPS (Integrated History and Philosophy of Science) has set forth a program for a unified discipline: \"Good history and philosophy of science is not just history of science into which some philosophy of science may enter, or philosophy of science into which some history of science may enter. It is work that is both historical and philosophical at the same time. The founding insight of the modern discipline of HPS is that history and philosophy have a special affinity and one can effectively advance both simultaneously\".\n\nOne origin of the unified discipline is the historical approach to the discipline of the philosophy of science. This hybrid approach is reflected in the career of Thomas Kuhn. His first permanent appointment, at the University of California, Berkeley, was to a position advertised by the philosophy department, but he also taught courses from the history department. When he was promoted to full professor in the history department only, Kuhn was offended at the philosophers' rejection because \"I sure as hell wanted to be there, and it was my philosophy students who were working with me, not on philosophy but on history, were nevertheless my more important students\". This attitude is also reflected in his historicist approach, as outlined in Kuhn's seminal Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962, 2nd ed. 1970), wherein philosophical questions about scientific theories and, especially, theory change are understood in historical terms, employing concepts such as paradigm shift.\n\nHowever, Kuhn was also critical of attempts fully to unify the \"methods\" of history and philosophy of science: \"Subversion is not, I think, too strong a term for the likely result of an attempt to make the two fields into one. They differ in a number of their central constitutive characteristics, of which the most general and apparent is their goals. The final product of most historical research is a narrative, a story, about particulars of the past. [...] The philosopher, on the other hand, aims principally at explicit generalizations and at those with universal scope. He is no teller of stories, true or false. His goal is to discover and state what is true at all times and places rather than to impart understanding of what occurred at a particular time and place.\" More recent work questions whether these methodological and conceptual divisions are in fact barriers to a unified discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is holophrastic indeterminacy that underlies Quine's argument against synonymy, the basis of his objections to Rudolf Carnap's analytic/synthetic distinction.

A distinction is made between necessary versus contingent (concerning reality), versus (concerning knowledge), and analytic versus synthetic (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, \"a priori\", analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, \"a posteriori\", synthetic).\n\nThe \"necessary\" is generally true in all possible worlds—usually by mere logical validity—whereas the \"contingent\" hinges on the way the real world is. The \"a priori\" is knowable before or without, whereas the \"a posteriori\" is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The \"analytic\" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a tautology—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the \"synthetic\" is true by its terms' meanings in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world. Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. \n\nHume's strong empiricism, as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's problem of induction, was taken as a threat to Newton's theory of motion. Immanuel Kant responded with rationalism in his 1781 \"Critique of Pure Reason\", where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those sense data into the experience of space and time. Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic \"a priori\"—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis (Kant's pitchfork) and thus saving Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n\nIn 1919, Newton's theory fell to Einstein's general theory of relativity. In the late 1920s, the logical positivists rejected Kant's synthetic \"a priori\" and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a logical syntax entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims verifiable as either false or true. In the early 1950s, Willard Van Orman Quine undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating ontological relativity, as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world. By the early 1970s, Saul Kripke established the necessary \"a posteriori\", since if the Morning Star and the Evening Star are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.\n\nHume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy. Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the \"No true Scotsman\" move. Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning and Hume's law. Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as beliefs versus desires and as impressions versus ideas.\n\nThe first distinction is between two different areas of human study:\n\nHume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:\n\n\nIn modern terminology, members of the first group are known as analytic propositions and members of the latter as synthetic propositions. This terminology comes from Kant (Introduction to \"Critique of Pure Reason\", Section IV).\n\nInto the first class fall statements such as \"all bodies are extended\", \"all bachelors are unmarried\", and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like \"the sun rises in the morning\", and \"all bodies have mass\".\n\nHume wants to prove that certainty does not exist in science. First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern brain in a vat theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.\n\nSecond, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: \"Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls.\" While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.\n\nThird, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement \"An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.\" While some earlier philosophers (most notably Plato and Descartes) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.\n\nThe results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.\n\nIf accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the existence of God (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement \"God exists,\" it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the ontological argument for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. \n\nHume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:\nIf we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. — \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\"\n"}
{"id": "2049301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049301", "title": "Idealization (science philosophy)", "text": "Idealization (science philosophy)\n\nIdealization is the process by which scientific models assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an \"ideal case,\" then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.\n\nIf an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for air resistance when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.\n\nIdealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of Stokes' law allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.\n\nGalileo utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of free fall. Galileo, in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.\n\nThe most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. Galileo predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires friction). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.\n\nGeometry involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect circles, spheres, straight lines and angles are abstractions that help us think about and investigate the world.\n\nAn example of the use of idealization in physics is in Boyle’s Gas Law:\n\"Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.\"\n\nIn physics, people will often solve for Newtonian systems without friction. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the force of friction is negligible.\n\nIt has been argued by the \"Poznań School\" (in Poland) that Karl Marx utilized idealization in the social sciences (see the works written by Leszek Nowak). Similarly, in economic models individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices. This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.\n\nIn psychology, idealization refers to a defence mechanism in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in child custody conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine (\"idealize\") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.\n\nWhile idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others. For instance, Edmund Husserl recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.\n\nAlthough idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern science, it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the philosophy of science. For example, Nancy Cartwright suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.\n\nThere is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo’s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the ideal gas law) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.\n\n"}
{"id": "3189827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3189827", "title": "Integrationism", "text": "Integrationism\n\nIntegrationism (also known as integrational linguistics) is an approach in the theory of communication that emphasizes innovative participation by communicators within contexts and rejects rule-based models of language. It was developed by a group of linguists at the University of Oxford during the 1980s, notably Roy Harris.\n\nThe International Association for the Integrational Study of Language and Communication was founded in 1998 and has members in more than twenty-five countries around the world.\n\nWhile the integrationist views of Harris and Dr Adrian Pablé, among others, differ from those who believe that cognition is distributed (i.e. Kravchenko and Love), the view on language between the two fields are quite similar. Both sides criticize the traditional view of linguistics which holds language as an individual internal psychological concern that takes written language as the base from which to begin analysis. Instead, integrationists view knowledge (which includes language) as “(i) linked to an individual’s experience, and therefore dependent on the ‘evidence available’ to that particular individual, but at the same time (ii) unpredictable because any integrational task involving sign-making and sign-interpreting is carried out in actual, time-embedded situations, which are not simply ‘given’, either.”. In other words, language usage is intrinsically, and without fail, contextual in all of its uses. Furthermore, Pablé, Haas & Christe question whether language is even amenable to scientific description, based upon its contextual nature.\nThe contextual nature of language leads to a rejection of the notion that language is a ‘fixed code’. Harris discusses this extensively:\n\nInstead of parts of a fixed code, language is looked at as a resource to conduct action with, an idea that echoes the notions put forth by speech act theorists such as Austin and Searle, interactional sociolinguists such as Gumperz, conversation analysts such as Sacks, Schegloff, and Goodwin, as well as others such as Goffman, all of whom were or are active in fields outside of linguistics, including language philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. Harris claims that to not know what a word means is to not know what to do with the words, to not know “how to integrate the occurrence of the word into enough of our linguistic experience to satisfy the requirement of the [present] case”.\nPablé explores the integrationist views of language in terms of the naming practices related to castles in Bellinzona, Switzerland. By asking locals the directions to castles using non-standard names for the castles, Pablé elicited various forms by which the locals referred to them, highlighting the idea that references to the places were “highly context sensitive” and that the “meaning” is created on the spot, and that “speakers always make sense of language in light of their own experience”.\n\nAccording to integrationist principles, the separation of linguistic phenomena into distinct parts of study is a fundamental error in the conceptualization of language. In 'The Language Myth', Harris postulates that the isolation and subsequent segregational approach of orthodox linguistics is a result of the fact of language itself being the descriptive medium for its own study. A problem arises when we consider words as stand-ins for things. When we then have a word for a language, the word misleads us to consider languages to be things out there in the world rather than real time, second order processes undergoing constant adjustment.\n\nIntegrationism overlaps with recent and not so recent epistemologies concerning communication and interaction. It retains an interest in understanding the system of language-making as an emergent, context-bound, and fundamentally human activity. This view is philosophically consistent with sociocultural theories such as activity theory where the historicity of human experience is recognized to have implications on our activities in ways that shape how they unfold.\n\nIntegrationist linguistics overlaps with pragmatic and phenomenological approaches such as ethnomethodology and conversation analysis. The latter being rightly susceptible to a written and spoken word bias yet this is not without current attempts to broaden and include a wider range of semiotic contingencies into analyses. The more fundamental overlap is epistemological. Harold Garfinkel's (1994) ethnomethodological policies prioritize the context of interaction with strict objection to analytic presupposed systems of any kind other than that which is made so by the sequentially ordered interactions of participants. Conversation analysts have developed an empirical approach stemming from those policies where spoken and written words are centralized. A recent decentralizing move to the analysis and theorization of multimodal sequential analysis is very much consistent with an integrationist point of view.\n\nWhile integrationism has been in existence for over three decades, advocating against the “language myth” and indicating that linguistic sign alone cannot function as the basis of an independent, self-sufficient form of communication, but depends for effectiveness on its integration with non-verbal activities of many different kinds, some integrationists have recently directed this perspective to revisit another important concept in sociolinguistics – “social identity”.\n\nThis integrational view of identity concurs with the sociocultural perspective that identity is not a rigid and static system predetermined on the basis of either social class, gender, ethnicity, age or education, but rather a discursive and constantly emerging experience that is locally shared and situationally evoked. On the other hand, however, stressing that identity cannot be examined exclusively from an individual’s integrational practice (including both linguistic and non-linguistic practice), integrationists cast doubt on the way sociocultural approach analyzes identity by specifically questioning three of the latter’s tenets: (i) data, (ii) phenomenological inductivism, and (iii) indirect indexicality. They point out an intrinsic controversy that while identity, as the speaker’s first-order experience, is highly context-dependent, the attempt to detect identity merely through inspecting the linguistic components in the tape-recorded data and interpret the data through postulating the existence of linguistically pre-labeled “concrete universals” (e.g. ‘varieties of language’, ‘style’) is actually de-contextualizing the speakers’ identity. Also, they identified another conflict in the sociocultural approach of interpreting a speaker’s identity between the claim of a socially indexical value of linguistic features (“social marker”) that is beyond a single occurrence and the one of locally indexical value of linguistic features that is analyzable only in term of one specific local context.\n\nCompared with sociolinguistic perspective on social identity, integrationists emphasize the integrational phenomenon that occurs when we converse with each other. Sociolinguists concentrate on how people utilize linguistic structures and items, cultural norms, and macro identities that they are normatively assigned in conversation. Based on utterances, sociolinguists attempt to capture speakers’ positionality and relationality in terms of identity, emergence of identity, and indexicality of the language that speakers used. It is problematic to integrationists that sociolinguists only focus upon what is said. In other words, sociolinguists take language as an independent structure that can be isolated from the ongoing conversation. Integrationists argue that utterances cannot be dissociated from the context where he utters statements. Utterances have to be integrated with the activities, linguistic and non-linguistic, at that moment.\n\nIn conclusion, from an integrational view, “social identity” is rather a “meta-discursive label used by lay speakers to cope with their everyday first-order experience” than a term or object of scientific study that is static and communicationally predetermined. In other words, along with their refusal of language as a static code system to be decoded for meaning transmission, they specifically emphasize that identity is not amenable to scientific description, as “sign-making and sign-interpreting are ‘private’ and cannot be detached from an individual’s integrational activities in the here-and-now”. The remaining question for integrationists is how to study ‘identity’ then. One suggestion integrationalists may be more up to is to treat what is displayed in the temporal situations as “beings” and “becomings” rather than fixed identities, and study it multimodally, which is to take different modalities and time scales into consideration, instead of merely relying on the pre-labelled linguistic features.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), literacy is defined as the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. In other words, the ability to read and write does not only to fulfill one’s own need but also to communicate with the community and society where one stays. With regard to it, this section first focuses on the distinction between spoken language (first-order language) and written language (second-order language) and how reading comprehension is achieved, and then aims at the impact of technology-enhanced interaction on reading comprehension.\n\nTraditionally, spoken language and written language are regarded as the two sides of the same coin In other words, written language is believed to fully represent its corresponding spoken language. Therefore, educators believe by teaching words, or the symbolization of phonetic signs, students are equipped with the literacy to understand the written texts. However, it is often the case that students have a hard time understanding and interpreting a poem even though they know every single word. The glittering example reveals the problem of treating spoken language and written language as the same and implies the need to treat them differently.\n\nAccording to Kravchenko, spoken language and written language are different in that spoken language is temporal and local, while written language is atemporal and non-local. The understanding of spoken language relies on the common knowledge shared by the participants who are involved in the conversation, and the cognition required is situated and highly interactional. As for written language, the understanding takes place when the text is written (product) rather than is being written (process). Therefore, it is less interactional. Despite the difference, the understanding of both linguistic systems calls for the appropriate background knowledge. An example adapted from Kravchenko is that if a traveler wants to check in and the clerk tells him/her, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, the traveler may check the watch and calculate when to come back for the check-in, so he/she does not have to stand at the front desk for 20 minutes. However, if the traveler sees a note on the front desk saying, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, he/she may be baffled due to no point of reference, so he/she does not know how long is needed. This example shows that it takes more efforts to establish background knowledge for the understanding of written language than spoken language. By extension, successful reading comprehension depends upon the establishment of shared knowledge between writers and readers.\n\nWith the development of technologies, written language includes not only printed work but also hypertexts. Because of the new genres of written language, new literacy is needed. Kravchenko maintained that literacy is the knowledge of using knowledge, so students have to develop the ability of reasoning and judgment based on the written texts. Jenkins et al. go further by claiming that the form of reasoning plays a more important role than the content of learning in the era of technology-enhanced interaction. To put it another way, the content can be easily stored and retrieved by means of technologies, so the practice of reasoning centers on how to generate, evaluate, interpret, and deploy the electronic resources. Different electronic resources can provide different affordances, so one of the aims of teaching new literacy is to help students develop the ability of knowing what functions that the certain electronic resource is good at. For instance, the text mediation through computers can facilitate the thinking, reflecting, and revising of one’s own thought. Videos, with the visual and auditory modality, can better help knowledge acquisition than pictures, which have the visual modality alone.\n\nThe hypertexts available online enable readers to create their own reading paths and recontextualize the resources of websites. Through the recontextualization, the thematic regions and semiotic formations are more idiosyncratic than fixed. The readers play a role in picking up the meaning through the created reading paths. According to Harris, linguistic signs should be understood with non-verbal activities. In addition to reading the hypertexts, the readers have access to other non-textual resources online, such as pictures, diagrams, videos, etc. The use of those non-verbal semiotic resources within the texts has its function and offers affordances to the readers to make meaning.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14511671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14511671", "title": "Interpretation (logic)", "text": "Interpretation (logic)\n\nAn interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.\n\nThe most commonly studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a function that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate \"T\" (for \"tall\") and assign it the extension {\"a\"} (for \"Abraham Lincoln\"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant \"T\", and does not make a claim about whether \"T\" is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'. Though \"we\" may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.\n\nAn interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the truth values of sentences in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or theory, the interpretation is called a model of that sentence or theory.\n\nA formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of \"sentences\" (variously called \"words\" or \"formulas\") built from a fixed set of \"letters\" or \"symbols\". The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the \"alphabet\" over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called \"well-formed formulæ\" (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (\"P\" or \"Q\") is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.\n\nA formal language formula_1 can be defined with the\nalphabet formula_2, and with a word being in formula_1 if it begins with formula_4 and is composed solely of the symbols formula_4 and formula_6.\n\nA possible interpretation of formula_1 could assign the decimal digit '1' to formula_4 and '0' to formula_6. Then formula_10 would denote 101 under this interpretation of formula_1.\n\nIn the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols (logical constants) and the non-logical symbols. The idea behind this terminology is that \"logical\" symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while \"non-logical\" symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.\n\nLogical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ (\"all\") and ∃ (\"some\"), symbols for logical connectives ∧ (\"and\"), ∨ (\"or\"), ¬ (\"not\"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.\n\nMany of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called \"truth functional\"; they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be \"satisfied\" by that assignment.\n\nNo sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation, but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations. A sentence is \"consistent\" if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is \"inconsistent\". A sentence φ is said to be \"logically valid\" if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a \"logical consequence\" of ψ).\n\nSome of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are truth-functional connectives that represent truth functions — functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).\n\nThe truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be logical constants, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.\n\nThis is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:\n\nSo under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.\n\nNow it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula \"F\": (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of \"F\" is True under that interpretation, \"F\" is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make \"F\" True again, since one of \"F\"s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for \"F\" are the only possible logical interpretations, and since \"F\" comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.\n\nAn \"interpretation of a theory\" is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a many-to-one correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a \"full interpretation\", otherwise it is called a \"partial interpretation\".\n\nThe formal language for propositional logic consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives. The only non-logical symbols in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.\n\nThe standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the truth values true and false. This function is known as a \"truth assignment\" or \"valuation\" function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign truthbearers instead.\n\nFor a language with \"n\" distinct propositional variables there are 2 distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable \"a\", for example, there are 2=2 possible interpretations: 1) \"a\" is assigned T, or 2) \"a\" is assigned F. For the pair \"a\", \"b\" there are 2=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned T, 2) both are assigned F, 3) \"a\" is assigned T and \"b\" is assigned F, or 4) \"a\" is assigned F and \"b\" is assigned T.\n\nGiven any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.\n\nUnlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a signature. The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol. In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number arity is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.\n\nFor example, in the language of rings, there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)\n\nAgain, we might define a first-order language L, as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.\n\nGiven a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols. The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol \"=\" for equality (see the section \"Interpreting equality\" below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.\n\nTo ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.\nAn object carrying this information is known as a structure ( signature σ), or σ-structure, or \"L\"-structure, or as a \"model\".\n\nThe information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its free variables, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the T-schema, which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.\n\nThis leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form and . The domain of discourse forms the range for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(\"x\"), where \"x\" is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula is satisfied if there is at least one element \"d\" of the domain such that φ(\"d\") is satisfied.\n\nStrictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(\"d\") mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because \"d\" is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.\n\nSome authors also admit propositional variables in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values \"true\" and \"false.\"\n\nBecause the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are extensional not intensional.\n\nAn example of interpretation formula_12 of the language L described above is as follows.\n\nIn the interpretation formula_12 of L:\n\nAs stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as\nwhere \"x\" is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence\nfails in any structure with an empty domain. Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.\n\nEmpty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.\n\nThe equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.\n\nThe first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if \"a\" = \"b\" and \"R\"(\"a\") holds then \"R\"(\"b\") holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for set theory or the signature for second-order arithmetic in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.\n\nThe second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a \"normal model\", so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called \"first order logic with equality\", but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.\n\nThere are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an equivalence relation and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an elementarily equivalent interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.\n\nA generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one \"sort\" of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.\n\nOne example of many-sorted logic is for planar Euclidean geometry. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation \"E\" which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the Euclidean plane, the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation \"E\"(\"p\",\"l\") holds if and only if point \"p\" is on line \"l\".\n\nA formal language for higher-order predicate logic looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc. All of these types of variables can be quantified.\n\nThere are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. \"Full semantics\" require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. \"Henkin semantics\", which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain \"D\", a collection of subsets of \"D\", a collection of functions from \"D\" to \"D\", etc. The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.\n\nThe interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of non-classical logic (such as intuitionistic logic), and in the study of modal logic.\n\nInterpretations used to study non-classical logic include topological models, Boolean-valued models, and Kripke models. Modal logic is also studied using Kripke models.\n\nMany formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.\n\nThe intended interpretation is called the \"standard model\" (a term introduced by Abraham Robinson in 1960). In the context of Peano arithmetic, it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are isomorphic to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the Peano axioms. There are also non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms, which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.\n\nWhile the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal syntactical rules, it naturally affects the choice of the formation and transformation rules of the syntactical system. For example, primitive signs must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; sentential formulas are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are meaningful declarative sentences; primitive sentences need to come out as true sentences in the interpretation; rules of inference must be such that, if the sentence formula_16 is directly derivable from a sentence formula_17, then formula_18 turns out to be a true sentence, with meaning implication, as usual. These requirements ensure that all provable sentences also come out to be true.\n\nMost formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of non-standard models is an example). When we speak about 'models' in empirical sciences, we mean, if we want reality to be a model of our science, to speak about an \"intended model\". A model in the empirical sciences is an \"intended factually-true descriptive interpretation\" (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same domain of discourse as the intended one, but other assignments for non-logical constants.\n\nGiven a simple formal system (we shall call this one formula_19) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols formula_20 and whose formation rule for formulas is:\n\nThe single axiom schema of formula_19 is:\n\nA formal proof can be constructed as follows:\n\nIn this example the theorem produced \" formula_30 \" can be interpreted as meaning \"One plus three equals four.\" A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as \"Four minus three equals one.\"\n\nThere are other uses of the term \"interpretation\" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.\n\nIn model theory, a structure \"A\" is said to interpret a structure \"B\" if there is a definable subset \"D\" of \"A\", and definable relations and functions on \"D\", such that \"B\" is isomorphic to the structure with domain \"D\" and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain \"D\" that is used, but rather \"D\" modulo an equivalence relation definable in \"A\". For additional information, see Interpretation (model theory).\n\nA theory \"T\" is said to interpret another theory \"S\" if there is a finite extension by definitions \"T\"′ of \"T\" such that \"S\" is contained in \"T\"′.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26511981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26511981", "title": "Islamic bioethics", "text": "Islamic bioethics\n\nIslamic bioethics, or Islamic medical ethics, ( \"al-akhlaq al-tibbiyyah\") refers to Islamic guidance on ethical or moral issues relating to medical and scientific fields, in particular, those dealing with human life.\n\nIn Islam, human life is regarded as an invaluable gift from God, and should therefore be both respected and protected. This is evident in many Qur’anic verses or \"ayat\", one of the most important being:\n\"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind.\"(Qur’an 5:32)\nIt is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved:\n\nThough Muslims recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur’an 2:258), the Qur’an illustrates that God has instilled in them reason, free will, the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur’an 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur’an 45:13). With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible.\n\nThe fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law (shari’a) and Islamic ethics. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or fatwas regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as bid‘ah (innovation) and, therefore, is haram (impermissible). For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, \n\n\nPrinciples of bioethics in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, Tom Beauchamp and James F. Childress, in their book, \"Principles of Biomedical Ethics\". The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely “Western” innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system. These bioethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur’anic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the \"Oath of the Muslim Doctor\" and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.\n\nFormulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period. After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority (mufti) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory (wajib/fard), recommended (mustahabb), neutral (mubah), discouraged (makruh) or forbidden (haram).\n\nAs health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many Islamic countries which work together with ulema to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of bioethics is jeopardized. The importance of Islamic law (sharia’) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include abortion, fertility treatments, family planning, euthanasia, genetic research, cloning, stem cell research among many other issues.\n\nThe Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE) Project is a multinational effort to produce a comprehensive collection of Islamic bioethics resources. Project staff members at two Georgetown University libraries, the Bioethics Research Library (Washington) and the School of Foreign Service-Qatar Library (Doha), have already compiled over 1,000 relevant written works into the IMSE Special Collection and have entered them into the searchable IMSE Database. The IMSE Project is funded by the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development.\n"}

{"id": "225153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225153", "title": "Juche", "text": "Juche\n\nJuche (; ; ; usually left untranslated or translated as \"self-reliance\") is the official state ideology of North Korea, described by the government as \"Kim Il-sung's original, brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought\". It postulates that \"man is the master of his destiny\", that the Korean masses are to act as the \"masters of the revolution and construction\" and that by becoming self-reliant and strong a nation can achieve true socialism.\n\nKim Il-sung (1912–1994) developed the ideology, originally viewed as a variant of Marxism–Leninism until it became distinctly Korean in character whilst incorporating the historical materialist ideas of Marxism–Leninism and strongly emphasizing the individual, the nation state and its sovereignty. Consequently, the North Korean government adopted \"Juche\" into a set of principles it uses to justify its policy decisions from the 1950s onwards. Such principles include moving the nation towards claimed \"jaju\" (\"independence\"), through the construction of \"jarip\" (\"national economy\") and an emphasis upon \"jawi\" (\"self-defence\") in order to establish socialism.\n\nThe practice of \"Juche\" is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency. The \"Juche\" ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the totalitarian rule of the North Korean regime and justifying the country's heavy-handed isolationism and oppression of the North Korean people. It has also been described as a form of Korean ethnic nationalism, but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the \"Korean race\" and acts as a foundation of the subsequent personality cult surrounding them.\n\n\"Juche\" comes from a Sino-Japanese word whose Japanese reading is \"shutai\". The word was coined in 1887 to translate the concept of \"\" in German philosophy (subject, meaning \"the entity perceiving or acting upon an object or environment\") into Japanese. The word migrated to the Korean language at around the turn of the century and retained this meaning. \"Shutai\" went on to appear in Japanese translations of Karl Marx's writings. North Korean editions of Marx used the word \"Juche\" even before the word was attributed to Kim Il-sung in its supposedly novel meaning in 1955.\n\nIn today's political discourse on North Korea, \"Juche\" has a connotation of \"self-reliance\", \"autonomy\" and \"independence\". It is often defined in opposition to the Korean concept of \"Sadae\", or reliance on the great powers. South Koreans use the word without reference to the North Korean ideology.\n\nOfficial statements by the North Korean government attribute the origin of \"Juche\" to Kim Il-sung's experiences in the Anti-Imperialist Youth League in 1930 in his \"liberation struggle\" against Japan. The first documented reference to \"Juche\" as an ideology appeared in 1955 in a speech given by Kim Il-sung entitled \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing \"Juche\" in Ideological Work\". The speech had been delivered to promote a political purge similar to the earlier Yan'an Rectification Movement in China.\n\nHwang Jang-yop, Kim's top adviser on ideology, discovered Kim's 1955 speech in the late 1950s when Kim, having established a cult of personality, sought to develop his own version of Marxism–Leninism into a North Korean ideology.\n\nIn his 1955 speech, the first known to refer to \"Juche\", Kim Il-sung said: To make revolution in Korea we must know Korean history and geography as well as the customs of the Korean people. Only then is it possible to educate our people in a way that suits them and to inspire in them an ardent love for their native place and their motherland.\n\nIn the speech \"On Socialist Construction and the South Korean Revolution in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" given on 14 April 1965, Kim Il-sung outlined the three fundamental principles of \"Juche\":\n\n\"On the Juche Idea\", the main work on \"Juche\", was published in North Korea in Kim Jong-il's name in 1982. In North Korea it functions as \"the authoritative and comprehensive explanation of \"Juche\"\". According to the treatise, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) is responsible for indoctrinating the masses in the ways of \"Juche\" thinking. According to the treatise, \"Juche\" is inexorably linked with Kim Il-sung and it \"represents the guiding idea of the Korean Revolution [...] we are confronted with the honorable task of modeling the whole society on the \"Juche\" idea\". Kim Jong-il states in the work that \"Juche\" is not a creative application of Marxism–Leninism, but rather \"a new era in the development of human history\" while criticizing the \"communists and nationalists\" of the 1920s for their elitist posture, claiming that they were \"divorced from the masses\". The WPK's break with basic premises of Marxism–Leninism emerges more clearly in the article \"Let Us March Under the Banner of Marxism–Leninism and the \"Juche\" Idea\".\n\nIn August 1997, the Central People's Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea promulgated regulations regarding use of the \"Juche\" Era calendar. Gregorian calendar dates are used for years before 1912 while years from 1912 (the year of Kim Il-sung's birth) are described as \"\"Juche\" years\". The Gregorian year 2018, for example, is \"\"Juche\" 107\" as 2018-1911=107. When used, \"\"Juche\" years\" are often accompanied by the Gregorian equivalent, i.e. \"\"Juche\" 107, 2018\" or \"\"Juche\" 107 (2018)\".\n\nKim's regime saw Juche principles as applicable around the world, not just in Korea. Since 1976 North Korea has organized international seminars on \"Juche\". The International Scientific Seminar on the \"Juche\" Idea took place in Antananarivo from 28 September to 30 September 1976 under the sponsorship of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar. Many prominent party and government officials, public figures, representatives of revolutionary and progressive organizations, scientists and journalists from more than fifty countries attended. Malagasy President Didier Ratsiraka expressed strong sympathies and support for North Korea. An excerpt from the opening speech says:Regardless of the opposition forces, the determination of the people and their strength and conviction are not measured by territorial dimensions, possession of advanced technology, still less, opulence or riches. For those who wish to forget the lesson of history so easily and so quickly, Algeria, Viet Nam, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola – and closer to us – Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Azania are excellent examples which make them deeply reflect on. What we want is not the perfection of political independence alone. The evil forces craftily manipulate the economic levers in order to perpetuate their supremacy and reduce us to vassals and eternal mendicants.\n\nThe International Institute of the \"Juche\" Idea was established in Tokyo in 1978 to supervise international \"Juche\" research-groups. The \"Juche\" Tower in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, incorporated commemorative plaques from supporters and \"Juche\" Study Groups from around the world. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Black Panther Party expressed sympathy for the Juche ideology. The Nepal Workers and Peasants Party identifies \"Juche\" as its guiding idea in its governance of the city of Bhaktapur.\n\nKimilsungism was first mentioned by Kim Jong-il in the 1970s and was introduced alongside the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System. Not long after the term's introduction into the North Korean lexicon, Kim Jong-il allegedly launched a \" of the Whole Society\" campaign. These campaigns were introduced so as to strengthen Kim Jong-il's position within the Workers' Party of Korea. According to political analyst Lim Jae-cheon, \"\"Kimilsungism\" refers to the thoughts of Kim Il-sung. It is interchangeable with the idea\". However, in his 1976 speech \"On Correctly Understanding the Originality of Kimilsungism\" he said that Kimilsungism comprises the \"\"Juche\" idea and a far-reaching revolutionary theory and leadership method evolved from this idea\". In the past Kim Il-sung's thoughts had been described by the official media as \"contemporary Marxism–Leninism\", but by calling it Kimilsungism Kim Jong-il was trying to elevate it to the same level as Maoism, Hoxhaism and Stalinism. The younger Kim further argued that Kim Il-sung's thoughts had evolved and they therefore deserved their own distinct name. He further added that \"Kimilsungism is an original idea that cannot be explained within the frameworks of Marxism–Leninism. The idea of \"Juche\", which constitutes the quintessence of Kimilsungism, is an idea newly discovered in the history of mankind\". Kim Jong-il went further, stating that Marxism–Leninism had become obsolete and must be replaced by Kimilsungism: \n\nAccording to analyst Shin Gi-wook, the ideas of \"Juche\" and Kimilsungism were in essence the \"expressions of North Korean particularism over supposedly more universalistic Marxism–Leninism\". In many ways, it signaled a move from socialism to nationalism. This was made very clear in a speech in 1982, when North Korea celebrated Kim Il-sung's 70th birthday in which love for the nation came before love for socialism. This particularism gave birth to such concepts as A Theory of the Korean Nation as Number One and Socialism of Our Style.\n\nFollowing the death of Kim Jong-il, Kimilsungism was turned into Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism at the 4th Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea. As well as stating that the WPK was \"the party of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il\", Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism was made \"the only guiding idea of the party\". In the 4th Conference's aftermath, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) stated that \"the Korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the President [Kim Il-sung] and Kim Jong-il as Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation\". Kim Jong-un, the WPK First Secretary, said that \"Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is an integral system of the idea, theory and method of \"Juche\" and a great revolutionary ideology representative of the \"Juche\" era. Guided by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, we should conduct Party building and Party activities, so as to sustain the revolutionary character of our Party and advance the revolution and construction in line with the ideas and intentions of the President and the General.\"\n\nSocialism of Our Style, also referred to as Korean-style socialism and our-style socialism within North Korea, is an ideological concept Kim Jong-il introduced on 27 December 1990 in the speech \"Socialism of Our Country is a Socialism of Our Style as Embodied by the \"Juche\" idea\". Speaking after the Revolutions of 1989 that brought down the Eastern Bloc regimes, Kim Jong-il explicitly stated that North Korea needed—and survived because of—Socialism of Our Style. He argued that socialism in Eastern Europe failed because they \"imitated the Soviet experience in a mechanical manner\". According to Kim, they failed to understand that the Soviet experience was based on specific historical and social circumstances and could not be used by other countries aside from the Soviet Union itself. He added that \"if experience is considered absolute and accepted dogmatically it is impossible to build Socialism properly, as the times change and the specific situation of each country is different from another\". Kim Jong-il went on to criticize \"dogmatic application\" of Marxism–Leninism, stating: \n\nNorth Korea would not encounter such difficulties because of the conceiving of \"Juche\". In his words, North Korea was \"a backward, colonial semifeudal society\" when the Communists took over, but since the North Korean Communists did not accept Marxism because it was based on European capitalist experiences, or Leninism, which was based on Russia's experience, they conceived of \"Juche\". Additionally, he believed the situation in North Korea was also more complex because of the American presence in South Korea. Thanks to Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il argued, the revolution had \"put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country\". \"The \"Juche\" idea is a revolutionary theory which occupies the highest stage of development of the revolutionary ideology of the working class\", Kim Jong-il said, further stating that the originality and superiority of the \"Juche\" idea defined and strengthened Korean socialism. He then conceded by stating that Socialism of Our Style was \"a man-centered Socialism\", explicitly making a break with basic Marxist–Leninist thought, which argues that material forces are the driving force of historical progress, not people. Socialism of Our Style was presented as an organic sociopolitical theory, using the language of Marxism–Leninism, saying: \n\nUnlike Marxism–Leninism, which considers improvements in the material conditions of production and exchange as the driving force of historical progress (known as historical materialism), \"Juche\" considers human beings in general the driving force in history. It is summarized as \"the popular masses are placed in the center of everything, and the leader is the center of the masses\". \"Juche\", North Korea maintains, is a \"man-centered ideology\" in which the \"man is the master of everything and decides everything\". In contrast to Marxist–Leninist thought in which people's decisions are inextricably linked to their relations to the means of production (a concept referred to as \"relations of production\"), in \"Juche\" thought man is independent and decides everything. Just like Marxist–Leninist thought, \"Juche\" believes history is law-governed, but that it is only man who drives progress, stating that \"the popular masses are the drivers of history\". However, for the masses to be successful, they need a \"Great Leader\". Marxism–Leninism argues that the popular masses will lead (on the basis of their relation to production), but in North Korea the role of a Great Leader should be essential for leadership. This theory allegedly helped Kim Il-sung establish a unitary, one-man rule over North Korea.\n\nThe theory turns the Great Leader into an absolutist, supreme leader. The working class is not to think for themselves, but instead to think through the Great Leader. The Great Leader is the \"top brain\" (i.e. \"mastermind\") of the working class, meaning that he is the only legitimate representative of the working class. Class struggle can be realized only through the Great Leader and difficult tasks in general and revolutionary changes in particular can be introduced only through and by the Great Leader. In historical development, it is the Great Leader who is the leading force of the working class. The Great Leader is also a flawless human being who never commits mistakes, who is always benevolent and who always rules for the masses. The leader is incorruptible. For the Great Leader system to function, a unitary ideological system must be in place. In North Korea, that unitary ideological system is known as the Ten Principles for a Monolithic Ideological System.\n\nUnlike the Joseon dynasty, where there was a huge gap between the upper and lower classes, North Korea had adopted the concept of a gathered-together \"people\". Instead of a strict social hierarchy, North Korea had in theory divided the union into three classes, namely peasant, worker and \"samuwon\" (intellectuals and professionals), where each was just as important as the other. The \"samuwon\" class consisted of clerks, small traders, bureaucrats, professors and writers. This was a unique class that was created to increase education and literacy of North Korea's population.\n\nNormally, Communist nations would value only the farmers or laborers, thus in the Soviet Union the intelligentsia was not defined as an independent class of its own, but rather as a \"social stratum\" that recruited itself from members of almost all classes: proletariat, petite bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie. However, a \"peasant intelligentsia\" was never mentioned. Correspondingly, the \"proletarian intelligentsia\" was exalted for bringing forth progressive scientists and Marxist theoreticians whereas the \"bourgeois intelligentsia\" was condemned for producing \"bourgeois ideology\", which were all non-Marxist worldviews. Language reforms followed revolutions more than once, such as the New Korean Orthography in North Korea (which failed due to Korean ethnic nationalist fears of precluding Korean unification), or the simplification of Chinese characters under Mao Zedong (a consequence of the divergent orthographic choices of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China), or the simplification of the Russian language after the 1917 revolution in Russia and consequent struggle against illiteracy, known in Soviet Russia as \"Likbez\" (\"Likvidaciya Bezgramotnosti\", liquidation of illiteracy).\n\nThey believed in rapid industrialization through labor and in subjecting nature to human will. By restructuring social classes into a mass of people who are theoretically all equal, the North Korean government claimed it would be able to attain self-reliance or \"Juche\" in upcoming years. This is questionable, because the country suffers massive food shortages annually and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.\n\n\"Songun\" (literally \"military-first policy\") was first mentioned on 7 April 1997 in \"Rodong Shinmun\" under the headline \"There Is a Victory for Socialism in the Guns and Bombs of the People's Army\". It defined the military-centered thinking of the time by stating; \"the revolutionary philosophy to safeguard our own style of socialism under any circumstances\". The concept was credited to \"Respected General Kim Jong-il\". In a joint editorial on 16 June 1998 entitled \"Our Party's Military-First Politics Will Inevitably Achieve Victory and Will Never Be Defeated\" by \"Kulloja\" (the WPK theoretical magazine) and \"Rodong Sinmun\", it was stated that \"Songun\" meant \"the leadership method under the principle of giving priority to the military and resolving the problems that may occur in the course of revolution and construction as well as establishing the military as the main body of the revolution in the course of achieving the total tasks of socialism\". While the article clearly referred to \"our Party\", this was not a reference to the WPK but rather to the personal leadership of Kim Jong-il. On 5 September 1998, the North Korean Constitution was revised and it made clear that the National Defence Commission, the highest military body, was the supreme body of the state. This date is considered the beginning of the \"Songun\" era.\n\nIn the view of some observers, \"Juche\" is not mere rhetoric, but rather an ideal of self-reliance that North Korea has attempted to put into practice.\n\nBased \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il argued: \"Independence is not in conflict with internationalism but is the basis of its strengthening\". He stated that North Korea co-operated with \"socialist countries\", the \"international communist movement\" and \"newly-emerging nations\" on the basis of non-interference, equality and mutual benefit.\n\nNorth Korea emerged from Soviet occupation and fought alongside the Chinese Communists in the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. However, it soon asserted its independence from both the Soviet Union and China. Though it rejected de-Stalinization, it avoided taking sides in the Sino-Soviet split. As the Communist bloc split, introduced market reforms and collapsed, North Korea increasingly emphasized \"Juche\" in both theory and practice.\n\nNorth Korea was admitted to the Non-Aligned Movement in 1975 and began to present itself as a leader of the Third World. It fostered diplomatic relations with developing countries and promoted \"Juche\" as a model for others to follow.\n\nNational survival has been seen as a guiding principle of North Korea's diplomatic strategy. Even in the midst of economic and political crises, North Korea continues to emphasize its independence on the world stage.\n\nIn \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il stated: \"In order to implement the principle of economic self-sufficiency, one must build an independent national economy\". More specifically, he stated, \"Heavy industry with the machine-building industry as its backbone is the pillar of an independent national economy\". He also emphasized the importance of technological independence and self-sufficiency in resources. However, he stated that this did not rule out international economic co-operation.\n\nIn 1956, Kim Il-sung declared \"Juche\" to be the guiding principle of the economy. After the devastation of the Korean War, North Korea began to rebuild its economy with a base in heavy industry, with the aim of becoming as self-sufficient as possible. As a result, North Korea developed what has been called the \"most autarkic industrial economy in the world\". North Korea received a lot of economic aid and technical assistance from the Soviet Union and China, but it did not join Comecon, the Communist common market. In the 1990s, it had one of the world's lowest rates for dependence on petroleum, using hydroelectric power and coal instead of imported oil. Its textile industry uses vinylon, known as the \"\"Juche\" fiber\", which was invented by a Korean and which is made from locally available coal and limestone. The history of the development of vinylon often featured in propaganda that preached the virtues of technological self-reliance. North Korea had 10,000 CNC machines in 2010. The first domestic homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995 and in 2017 it has around 15,000 machines.\n\nCommentators have often pointed out the discrepancy between the principle of self-sufficiency and North Korea's dependence on foreign aid, especially during its economic crisis in the 1990s. The pursuit of economic autarky has been blamed for contributing to the crisis. On this view, attempts at self-sufficiency led to inefficiency and to the neglect of export opportunities in industries where there was a comparative advantage.\n\nIn \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il stated: \"Self-reliance in defense is a fundamental principle of an independent sovereign state\". He stated that it was possible to get aid from friends and allies, but that this would be effective only if the state was militarily strong in its own right. He advocated a state where \"all the people are under arms and the whole country becomes a fortress\". He also advocated the development of a local defense industry to avoid dependence on foreign arms suppliers.\n\nNorth Korea has attempted to put this into practice. The Korean People's Army is one of the largest on earth. It is currently developing its own nuclear ballistic missile. Domestic production of UDMH fuel for liquid fueled missiles and Tumansky RD-9 Turbojet engine which powers Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 and Shenyang J-6. CNC machines are used for production of missiles and centrifuges. North Korea's propaganda since the Korean War has contrasted its military autonomy with the presence of American forces in the South.\n\nSome South Korean scholars categorize \"Juche\" as a national religion or they compare its facets to those of some religions. For instance, \"Juche\" has been compared to pre-existing religions in Korea (notably neo-Confucianism and Korean shamanism) due to their shared familiar principles. While the influence of traditional East Asian religions on \"Juche\" is widely disputed, the ideology has been thought of by several academic studies as having aspects of a national and indigenous religious movement in addition to being a political philosophy due to the following features: the presence of a sacred leader, rituals and familism. Despite the religious features of \"Juche\", it is a highly atheistic ideology that discourages the practice of mainstream religions. This draws from \"Juche\"s Marxist−Leninist origins. North Korea is officially an atheist state, but maintains a cult of personality identical to a religion, much like the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.\n\nAlthough the ideology appears to emphasize the central role of the human individual, \"Juche\" can be fulfilled only through the masses’ subordination to a single leader and accordingly, his successor. The ideology teaches that the role of a Great Leader is essential for the popular masses to succeed in their revolutionary movement because without leadership they are unable to survive. This is the foundation of North Korean cult of personality surrounding Kim Il Sung. The personality cult explains how the \"Juche\" ideology has been able to endure until today, even during the North Korean government's undeniable dependence on foreign assistance during its famine in the 1990s. The concept of the \"Sacred leader\" in \"Juche\" as well as the cult around the Kim family has been compared to the State Shinto ideology of Imperial Japan in which the Emperor was seen as a divine being.\n\nThrough the fundamental belief in the essential role of the Great Leader, the former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung has become the \"supreme deity for the people\" and the \"Juche\" doctrine is reinforced in North Korea's constitution as the country’s guiding principle. The parallel relationship structure between Kim Il-sung and his people to religious founders or leaders and their followers has led many scholars to consider \"Juche\" a religious movement as much as a political ideology. However, those familiar with cults would again posit that \"Juche\" bypasses the tenants of religion completely and instead meets the criteria of a totalitarian cult.\n\n\"Juche\"'s emphasis on the political and sacred role of the leader and the ensuing worshipping by the popular masses has been critiqued by various intellectual Marxists. They argue that the North Korean working class or the proletariat has been stripped of their honor and therefore call the cult of personality non-Marxist and non-democratic.\n\nThe religious behavior of \"Juche\" can also be seen in the perspectives of the North Korean people through refugee interviews from former participants in North Korea’s ritual occasions. One pertinent example is the Arirang Festival, which is a gymnastics and artistic festival held in the Rungnado May Day Stadium in Pyongyang. All components of the festival, from the selection of performers, mobilization of resources, recruitment of the audience and publicity for the show have been compared to facets of a national religious event.\n\nThe Arirang Festival has been described to demonstrate the power of the North Korean government to arrange a form of religious gathering. It has done so by \"appropriating a mass of bodies for calisthenic and performative arts representing the leader as the Father and his faithful followers\". The Festival's effectiveness in transforming its participants into loyal disciples of \"Juche\" seems to originate from the collectivist principle of \"one for all and all for one\" and the ensuing emotional bond and loyalty to the leader. According to the accounts of refugees who have been recruited to mass gymnastics, the collectivist principle has been nurtured through physical punishment such as beatings and more importantly the organization of recruits into small units, whose performances were held accountable by larger units. The Festival’s ritualistic components of collectivism serve to reinforce a \"certain structure of sociality and affect\", establishing Kim Il Sung as the \"Father\" in both the body and psyche of the performers.\n\nCharles K. Armstrong argues that familism has transformed itself into a kind of political religion in the form of \"Juche\". With the emergence of \"Juche\" as North Korea's guiding political principle since the 1960s, the familial relationship within the micro-family unit has been translated into a national, macro-unit with Kim Il-sung representing the father figure and the North Korean people representing his children. \"Juche\" is thus based on the language of family relationships with its East Asian or neo-Confucian \"resonances of filial piety and maternal love\".\nArmstrong also notes that North Korea has actually transferred the \"filial piety of nationalism in the family of the leader himself\" by positioning Kim Il-sung as the universal patriarch. He argues that while the official pursuit of the \"Juche\" ideology in the 1960s signaled North Korea's desire to separate from the \"fraternity of international socialism\", the ideology also replaced Stalin as the father figure with Kim Il-sung. In effect, North Korea's familial nationalism has supplanted the \"rather abstract, class-oriented language of socialism with a more easily understandable and identifiable language of familial connections, love and obligations\".\n\nThe cult of personality surrounding Kim expanded into a family cult when Kim Jong Il became the heir apparent after assuming important posts in the WPK and military in the early 1980s. Armstrong calls this a \"family romance\", which is a term Freud had used to describe \"the neurotic replacement of a child's real parents with fantasy substitutes\". Through the establishment of the North Korean family romance with the language, symbols and rituals related to familism, Kim Il Sung has been consecrated even further posthumously as the Great Father.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the North Korean regime became increasingly nationalistic—at least, in its official pronouncements—leading Kim Chonghun to state that \"Socialism of our Style\" was really \"Socialism without Socialism\". Speeches and official announcements made references to socialism, but neither to Marxist–Leninist thought nor to any basic communist concepts. Shin Gi-wook argues that \"there is no trace of Marxist–Leninism or the Stalinist notion of nationhood [in North Korea]. Instead, Kim stresses the importance of the Korean people's blood, soul and national traits, echoing earlier Korean nationalists such as Sin Chaeho, Yi Kwangsu and Choe Namson. He no longer has any interest in applying Marxism–Leninism to the North Korean situation; indeed it is no longer useful for the country\".\n\nCharles K. Armstrong says that \"North Korean Communism would not only be quite distinctive from the Soviet model, it would in some respects turn Marxism–Leninism upside-down\". The key differences are that the North Koreans place the primacy of ideology over materialism, retaining the vocabulary of family lineage and nationalism and giving it primacy over class struggle and supporting social distinction and hierarchy over classless society and egalitarianism. He concluded that North Korea may look \"Stalinist in form\", but that it was \"nationalist in content\".\n\nBrian Reynolds Myers dismisses the idea that \"Juche\" is North Korea's leading ideology, regarding its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners. He argues that it exists to be praised and not actually read. Based on his own experiences living in North Korea, Felix Abt describes Myers' arguments as \"shaky\" and \"questionable\". Having seen the extent to which North Korean university students actually believe in \"Juche\", Abt says it is \"rather absurd\" to describe the ideology as \"window-dressing\" for foreigners. He also questions how only three decades of Japanese occupation could simply upend the impact of \"thousands of years\" of history in Korea.\n\nDae-Sook Suh has stated that Kim-Il Sung had failed to explain the difference between Socialist patriotism and nationalism which Kim stated he opposed. Suh also criticised Kim for allegedly failing to explain how Marxism–Leninism has been applied to Korean conditions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Technically, a theory is said to be a limiting case of another, later theory when and if the later theory subsumes the theoretical relations and apparent referents of the earlier one. For example, physicists agree that classical mechanics constitutes a low-energy limiting case of relativity theory.\n\nIn words of Larry Laudan, realist philosophers use this phrase in the sense that the theory \"T can be a limiting case of [the theory] T only if (a) \"all\" the variables (observable and theoretical) assigned a value in T are assigned a value by T and (b) the values assigned to every variable of T are the same as, or very close to, the values T assigns to the corresponding variable when certain initial and boundary conditions—consistent with T—are specified\".\n\nThe idea that a theory (in our previous example, Newtonian mechanics) that is close to being true (i.e., that is verisimil) converges as a limiting case into a superior theory (in this example, relativistic mechanics) can be an argument for scientific realism, as the theoretical entities postulated by the previous theories are still considered existent (if one assumes semantic realism, they are considered existent because they are referred to) in the successor theories.\n\n"}

{"id": "1480754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1480754", "title": "My Dinner with Andre", "text": "My Dinner with Andre\n\nMy Dinner with Andre is a 1981 American comedy-drama film directed by Louis Malle, and written by and starring Andre Gregory (Andre) and Wallace Shawn (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at Café des Artistes in Manhattan. The film's dialogue covers such things as experimental theatre, the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest humanism with Andre's spiritual experiences.\n\nAndre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director Jerzy Grotowski, and a group of Polish actors in a forest in Poland, his visit to Findhorn in Scotland, and his trip to the Sahara to try to create a play based on \"The Little Prince\" by St.-Exupéry. He worked with a group in a small piece of performance art on Long Island, which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) buried alive on Halloween night.\n\nThe rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. Erik Satie's \"Gymnopédie No. 1\" plays in the background.\n\n\nThe idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation. Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play. Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic Roger Ebert) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with Noah Baumbach in 2009, Shawn said, \n\nI actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of \"me\" there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.\n\nThe screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director Louis Malle. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity. Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating. Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.\n\n\"My Dinner with Andre\" was filmed in the Jefferson Hotel, which was then vacant, in Richmond, Virginia. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) Lloyd Kaufman was the production manager on the film, and Troma Entertainment provided production support. The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic Café des Artistes in New York City.\n\nRoger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave high praise to the film on \"Sneak Previews\"; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year. Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his \"Great Movies\" essay series. He said, \"Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clichés. I thought for a moment, and then answered, \"My Dinner with Andre\".\" The Boston Society of Film Critics Awards ranked it as the \"Best American Film\" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best Screenplay.\n\nThroughout the film, Andre references his wife \"Chiquita\"; in real life he was married to Mercedes \"Chiquita\" Nebelthau, who died in 1992. Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about Jerzy Grotowski, whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.\n\nThroughout the film, Wally references his \"girlfriend Debbie\". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer Deborah Eisenberg, although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.\n\n\nRichard Linklater is a big fan of \"My Dinner With Andre\" and considers this film to be a big influence on his own work.\n\n\n"}

This is often taken to imply that no way of seeing the world can be taken as definitively \"true\", but does \"not\" necessarily entail that all perspectives are equally valid. The term was coined by nineteenth-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nPerspectivism rejects objective metaphysics, claiming that no evaluation of objectivity can transcend cultural formations or subjective designations. Therefore, there are no objective facts, nor any knowledge of a thing-in-itself. Truth is separated from any particular vantage point, and so there are no ethical or epistemological absolutes. Rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) are constantly reassessed according to the circumstances of individual perspectives. \"Truth\" is thus created by integrating different vantage points together.\n\nPeople always adopt perspectives by default – whether they are aware of it or not – and the concepts of one's existence are defined by the circumstances surrounding that individual. Truth is made by and for individuals and peoples. This view differs from many types of relativism which consider the truth of a particular proposition as something that altogether cannot be evaluated with respect to an \"absolute truth\", without taking into consideration culture and context.\n\nThis view is outlined in an aphorism from Nietzsche's posthumously-assembled collection \"The Will to Power\":\n\nRichard Schacht, in his interpretation of Nietzsche's thought, argues that this can be expanded into a revised form of \"objectivity\" in relation to \"subjectivity\" as an aggregate of singular viewpoints that illuminate, for example, a particular idea in seemingly self-contradictory ways but upon closer inspection would reveal a difference of contextuality and of rule by which such an idea (e.g., that is fundamentally perspectival) can be validated. Therefore, it can be said each perspective is subsumed into and, taking account of its individuated context, adds to the overall objective measure of a proposition under examination. Nevertheless, perspectivism does not implicate any method of inquiry nor a structural theory of knowledge in general.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, perspectivism was revived by José Ortega y Gasset.\n\n"}

If something is \"water\", then many of its subparts will also be \"water\". Hence, \"apple\" is quantized, while \"water\" is not.\n\nQuantization has proven relevant to the proper characterization of grammatical telicity (roughly, sentences that present events as bounded/unbounded in time) and the mass/count distinction for nouns. The notion was first applied to linguistic semantics by the linguist Manfred Krifka.\n\nFormally, a quantization predicate \"QUA\" can be defined as follows, where formula_1 is the universe of discourse, formula_2 is a variable over sets, and formula_3 is a mereological part structure on formula_1 with formula_5 the mereological part-of relation:\nformula_6\n\nIn Renate Bartsch, Johan van Benthem, and Peter van Emde Boas (eds.), \"Semantics and\nContextual Expressions\", pp 75-115.

In the \"Iliad\", Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the \"immortal oil of the rose\" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him \"among rose blossoms\". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.\n\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity. Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting \"The Feast of the Rosary\" (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.\n\nThe cultivation of geometrical gardens, in which the rose has often held pride of place, has a long history in Iran and surrounding lands. In the lyric ghazal, it is the beauty of the rose that provokes the longing song of the nightingale - an image prominent, for example, in the poems of Hafez.\n\nIn turn, the imagery of lover and beloved became a type of the Sufi mystic's quest for divine love, so that Ibn Arabi, for example, aligns the rose with the beloved's blushing cheek on the one hand and, on the other, with the divine names and attributes.\n\nOther well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include;\n\nCatalans on the north eastern Spain have traditionally celebrated Saint George's Day (April 23)—which commemorates Saint George (\"Sant Jordi\"), the patron saint of the Catalonia region; as the \"dia dels enamorats\" (lovers' day), on which lovers exchange blood-red roses.\n\nThe rose is the national flower of England, a usage dating back to the English civil wars of the fifteenth century (later called Wars of the Roses), in which a red rose represented the House of Lancaster, and a white rose represented the House of York. The Tudor dynasty created the Tudor rose, which united both the white and the red roses, a symbolism dramatized by Shakespeare in his play \"Richard III\". The traditional ballad \"The Rose of England\" (Child 166) recounts the seizure of the crown by Earl of Richmond (who became Henry VII of England, the founder the Tudor dynasty), using the \"red rose\" as an allegory for Henry.\n\nThe England national rugby union team and Rugby Football Union adopted the red rose as their symbol in 1871, and the rose has appeared on players' kit ever since.\n\nIn 1986, the rose was adopted as the national floral emblem of the United States.\n\nIt is the state flower of five U.S. states: \n\nPortland, Oregon has counted \"City of Roses\" among its nicknames (see roses in Portland, Oregon) since 1888, and has held an annual Rose Festival since 1905. The city is also known for its International Rose Test Garden.\n\nPasadena, California—also nicknamed the \"City of Roses\"—has held the annual Tournament of Roses Parade since 1890, and 1902 the Parade has been held in conjunction with the Rose Bowl Game (which is now played at the city's Rose Bowl stadium, built in 1922).\n\nIn April 2011, the U.S. government's space program agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), celebrated the Hubble Space Telescope's 21st anniversary by releasing an image of spiral galaxies Arp 273 positioned in a rose-like shape.\n\nThe red rose is also part of the official logo of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), being a symbol of socialism generally. \n\nIn 1930, \"Rosa acicularis\" (the wild rose or prickly rose) was adopted as the official provincial flower of the Canadian province of Alberta. The suggestion that a provincial floral emblem be adopted by first made by an Edmonton newspaper editor; \"the Women's Institutes took up the suggestion and passed it on to the Department of Education, and the province's schoolchildren made the final choice.\"\n\nThe Wildrose Party, a now-defunct Albertan political party, was named after the province's official flower.\n\nThe Mexican city of Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, is nicknamed the \"City of Roses\" (\"Ciudad de las Rosas\").\n\nThe Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives at New York University states that the rose \"has always been an important symbol with anti-authoritarian associations.\" The rose is used to show the end after the means, meaning \"lay a rose on the grave\". The rose symbol became popular among socialist and social democratic political parties in post-World War II Western Europe. The symbol of a rose in a fist is used by the Socialist International \"and many of its member parties\" such as the French Socialist Party (PS).\n\nThe British Labour Party has used a red rose as its symbol since the late 1980s; the rose replaced the party's previous symbol, the red flag.\n\nThe White Rose was a World War II non-violent resistance group in Germany.\n\n"}

In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking.\n\nSentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity. Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.\n\nSentientist thinking has a long history, from Jeremy Bentham's An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation through to contemporary philosophers such as Richard D. Ryder and Peter Singer.\n\nSentientism differs from Speciesism in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.\n\nSentientism differs from painism in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. \n\nSentientism agrees with Animalism that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration. \n\nNotable sentientists include: Diana Fleischman, Peter Singer and Alasdair Cochrane.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "321652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321652", "title": "Term logic", "text": "Term logic\n\nIn philosophy, term logic, also known as traditional logic, syllogistic logic or Aristotelian logic, is a loose name for an approach to logic that began with Aristotle and that was dominant until the advent of modern predicate logic in the late nineteenth century. This entry is an introduction to the term logic needed to understand philosophy texts written before it was replaced as a formal logic system by predicate logic. Readers lacking a grasp of the basic terminology and ideas of term logic can have difficulty understanding such texts, because their authors typically assumed an acquaintance with term logic.\n\nAristotle's logical work is collected in the six texts that are collectively known as the \"Organon\". Two of these texts in particular, namely the \"Prior Analytics\" and \"De Interpretatione\", contain the heart of Aristotle's treatment of judgements and formal inference, and it is principally this part of Aristotle's works that is about term logic. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Jan Lukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley – which informs modern translations of \"Prior Analytics\" by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.\n\nThe fundamental assumption behind the theory is that propositions are composed of two terms – hence the name \"two-term theory\" or \"term logic\" – and that the reasoning process is in turn built from propositions:\n\nA proposition may be universal or particular, and it may be affirmative or negative. Traditionally, the four kinds of propositions are:\nThis was called the \"fourfold scheme\" of propositions (see types of syllogism for an explanation of the letters A, I, E, and O in the traditional square). Aristotle's \"original\" square of opposition, however, does not lack existential import.\n\nIn the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article, \"The Traditional Square of Opposition\", Terence Parsons explains:\n\nA term (Greek \"horos\") is the basic component of the proposition. The original meaning of the \"horos\" (and also of the Latin \"terminus\") is \"extreme\" or \"boundary\". The two terms lie on the outside of the proposition, joined by the act of affirmation or denial.\nFor early modern logicians like Arnauld (whose \"Port-Royal Logic\" was the best-known text of his day), it is a psychological entity like an \"idea\" or \"concept\". Mill considers it a word. To assert \"all Greeks are men\" is not to say that the concept of Greeks is the concept of men, or that word \"Greeks\" is the word \"men\". A proposition cannot be built from real things or ideas, but it is not just meaningless words either.\n\nIn term logic, a \"proposition\" is simply a \"form of language\": a particular kind of sentence, in which the subject and predicate are combined, so as to assert something true or false. It is not a thought, or an abstract entity. The word \"propositio\" is from the Latin, meaning the first premise of a syllogism. Aristotle uses the word premise (\"protasis\") as a sentence affirming or denying one thing or another (\"Posterior Analytics\" 1. 1 24a 16), so a premise is also a form of words.\nHowever, as in modern philosophical logic, it means that which is asserted by the sentence. Writers before Frege and Russell, such as Bradley, sometimes spoke of the \"judgment\" as something distinct from a sentence, but this is not quite the same. As a further confusion the word \"sentence\" derives from the Latin, meaning an opinion or judgment, and so is equivalent to \"proposition\".\n\nThe \"logical quality\" of a proposition is whether it is affirmative (the predicate is affirmed of the subject) or negative (the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus \"every philosopher is mortal\" is affirmative, since the mortality of philosophers is affirmed universally, whereas \"no philosopher is mortal\" is negative by denying such mortality in particular.\n\nThe \"quantity\" of a proposition is whether it is universal (the predicate is affirmed or denied of all subjects or of \"the whole\") or particular (the predicate is affirmed or denied of some subject or a \"part\" thereof). In case where existential import is assumed, quantification implies the existence of at least one subject, unless disclaimed.\n\nFor Aristotle, the distinction between singular and universal is a fundamental metaphysical one, and not merely grammatical. A singular term for Aristotle is primary substance, which can only be predicated of itself: (this) \"Callias\" or (this) \"Socrates\" are not predicable of any other thing, thus one does not say \"every Socrates\" one says \"every human\" (\"De Int.\" 7; \"Meta.\" D9, 1018a4). It may feature as a grammatical predicate, as in the sentence \"the person coming this way is Callias\". But it is still a \"logical\" subject.\n\nHe contrasts universal (\"katholou\") secondary substance, genera, with primary substance, particular (\"kath' hekaston\") specimens. The formal nature of universals, in so far as they can be generalized \"always, or for the most part\", is the subject matter of both scientific study and formal logic.\n\nThe essential feature of the syllogism is that, of the four terms in the two premises, one must occur twice. Thus\n\nThe subject of one premise, must be the predicate of the other, and so it is necessary to eliminate from the logic any terms which cannot function both as subject and predicate, namely singular terms.\n\nHowever, in a popular 17th century version of the syllogism, Port-Royal Logic, singular terms were treated as universals:\n\nThis is clearly awkward, a weakness exploited by Frege in his devastating attack on the system.\n\nThe famous syllogism \"Socrates is a man ...\", is frequently quoted as though from Aristotle, but fact, it is nowhere in the \"Organon\". Sextus Empiricus in his \"Hyp. Pyrrh\" (Outlines of Pyrronism) ii. 164 first mentions the related syllogism \"Socrates is a human being, Every human being is an animal, Therefore, Socrates is an animal.\"\n\nThe Aristotelian logical system had a formidable influence on the late-philosophy of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. In the early 1970s, Lacan reworked Aristotle's term logic by way of Frege and Jacques Brunschwig to produce his four formulae of sexuation. While these formulae retain the formal arrangement of the square of opposition, they seek to undermine the universals of both qualities by the 'existence without essence' of Lacan's particular negative proposition.\n\nTerm logic began to decline in Europe during the Renaissance, when logicians like Rodolphus Agricola Phrisius (1444–1485) and Ramus (1515–1572) began to promote place logics. The logical tradition called Port-Royal Logic, or sometimes \"traditional logic\", saw propositions as combinations of ideas rather than of terms, but otherwise followed many of the conventions of term logic. It remained influential, especially in England, until the 19th century. Leibniz created a distinctive logical calculus, but nearly all of his work on logic remained unpublished and unremarked until Louis Couturat went through the Leibniz \"Nachlass\" around 1900, publishing his pioneering studies in logic.\n\n19th-century attempts to algebraize logic, such as the work of Boole (1815–1864) and Venn (1834–1923), typically yielded systems highly influenced by the term-logic tradition. The first predicate logic was that of Frege's landmark \"Begriffsschrift\" (1879), little read before 1950, in part because of its eccentric notation. Modern predicate logic as we know it began in the 1880s with the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, who influenced Peano (1858–1932) and even more, Ernst Schröder (1841–1902). It reached fruition in the hands of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead, whose \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910–13) made use of a variant of Peano's predicate logic.\n\nTerm logic also survived to some extent in traditional Roman Catholic education, especially in seminaries. Medieval Catholic theology, especially the writings of Thomas Aquinas, had a powerfully Aristotelean cast, and thus term logic became a part of Catholic theological reasoning. For example, Joyce's \"Principles of Logic\" (1908; 3rd edition 1949), written for use in Catholic seminaries, made no mention of Frege or of Bertrand Russell.\n\nSome philosophers have complained that predicate logic:\n\nEven academic philosophers entirely in the mainstream, such as Gareth Evans, have written as follows:\n\n\n"}

Imre Lakatos characterizes it as a \"watered down\" form of provable truth propounded by some sociologists of knowledge, particularly Thomas Kuhn and Michael Polanyi.\n\nPhilosopher Nigel Warburton argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth. That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.<br>\nThere are two main reasons for this:\n\n\nAnother unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote. This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed. Warburton gives astrology as an example of this. He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology. The fact that something \"is generally agreed\" or that \"most people believe\" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth. He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.\n\nWarburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of democracy in decision-making. Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of tyranny.\n\nWeinberger characterizes Jürgen Habermas as a proponent of a consensus theory of truth, and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds: First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous. Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards \"one single\" limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.\n"}

It explores and analyzes the relevance of Whitehead's thought in dialogue with contemporary philosophies in order to unfold his philosophy of organism and its consequences for our time and in relation to emerging philosophical thought. Of particular interest is the investigation into the emergence of Whitehead's philosophy in the context of British and American pragmatism, its complicated relation to Continental philosophy and the analytic tradition, the relevance of his thought in the discourse of post-modern paradigms of deconstruction and post-structuralism, and its creative impulse for developing process philosophies. Additionally, following Whitehead's own inclination to reach beyond European modes of thought, WRP seeks to extend its horizon of research by fostering similar conversations with strains of Indian and East Asian thought, thereby exhibiting de facto mutual influence–e.g., with the Kyoto School of Buddhist philosophy.\n\nThe WRP was conceived and founded in 2005 by Roland Faber, who serves as its executive director. In February 2005, Faber proposed and installed WRP as a project of the Center for Process Studies, a faculty research center of the Claremont School of Theology since 1973 and of which Faber is the executive director. In March 2005, the goal of creating a fully integrated online Whitehead research interface was established as a long-term, strategic aim of WRP. The official inauguration of WRP followed in December 2005 with its first international conference, \"Event and Decision\", on Badiou, Deleuze, and Whitehead. In March 2006, Faber invited Brian G. Henning to serve as the WRP's Director of Research. In July 2006, the creation of the WRP's International Board of Academic Advisors signaled the completion of the first phase of the genesis of WRP.\n\nIn July 2009, the WRP announced the creation of the Whitehead Research Interface, also known as EVE (in honor of Whitehead's beloved wife, Evelyn). Once implemented, EVE will revolutionize the study of Whitehead's works by providing open access to the most complete electronic library of Whiteheadian scholarship in the world, some parts of which have never been made available to scholars.\n\nIn 2009, WRP founded Contemporary Whitehead Studies (CWS), an interdisciplinary book series that publishes manuscripts from scholars with contemporary and innovative approaches to Whitehead studies. By publishing innovative and adventurous approaches to Whitehead’s philosophy that engage with the problems, promise, and ideas of the twenty-first century, Contemporary Whitehead Studies creates a vital and dynamic space for scholarly engagement.\n\nIn September 2010, the WRP announced the inauguration of the Critical Edition of Whitehead, a long-term initiative of the WRP that will, for the first time, make available the complete published and unpublished writings of Alfred North Whitehead in a single, critical edition. The Critical Edition of Whitehead is led by General Editor George R. Lucas, Jr. and Executive Editor Brian G. Henning.\n\n\n\n"}
