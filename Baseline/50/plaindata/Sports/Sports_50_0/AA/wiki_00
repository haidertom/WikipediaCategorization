{"id": "34148711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34148711", "title": "1993 Cherbourg incident", "text": "1993 Cherbourg incident\n\nThe 1993 Cherbourg incident were a series of maritime incidents which took place from 26 March to 2 April 1993 between the British Royal Navy and French fishermen as a result of a fishing rights dispute in and around the Channel Islands waters.\n\nThe tensions around the Channel Islands waters rose high since September 1992, when the European Union (EU) recognised a six-mile British limit for exclusive fishing rights around the islands. Until then, British and French trawlers operated in the zone without restrictions. The agreement left a three-mile limit from the coastline where only Jersey trawlers could fish, between the three-mile and the six-mile for any British-flagged boat and an outer area between the six-mile and the 12-mile limit where only British and French fishing boats could operate.\n\nThe first incident took place on 26 March, when two fishing inspectors from the Channel Islands were illegally taken on the trawler \"Impatiens\" to the French port of Barneville-Carteret, after the French fishing boat was challenged by the British fishery vessel HMS \"Orkney\" from Guernsey, which confiscated her pots. The inspectors were rescued some hours later by a French coastguard vessel. On 28 March 1993, HMS \"Blazer\" was paying a visit to Cherbourg when the local fishermen learned that a boat from their fleet, the \"La Calypso\", had been stopped at sea by a British minesweeper, HMS \"Brocklesby\". The captain of the \"La Calypso\" refused to submit and set out for Cherbourg with three British fishery protection servicemen on board. A French port vessel later returned the personnel to Royal Navy control. Eight French trawlers subsequently surrounded the \"Blazer\" at 3:00 pm and angry fishermen boarded the ship. According to witnesses, HMS \"Blazer\" was seized while manoeuvring outside the port and sailed to Cherbourg harbour by the intruders. Her crew of 16 were forced to remain below the deck for three hours, while the ship's White Ensign was burned. French authorities subsequently put an end to the situation and forcibly expelled the fishermen from \"Blazer\" and placed them under arrest. The French Navy, meanwhile, dispatched the patrol boat \"Coriander\" to Cherbourg. On 29 March a flotilla of 36 French trawlers steamed up to Saint Peter Port in Guernsey, where a preliminary deal was agreed. After the first incidents, the Royal Navy deployed unarmed Royal Marines to conduct any future similar law enforcement operations. The marines were from 40 Commando, based at Taunton in Somerset. The \"La Calypso\" was eventually caught by the fishery vessel HMS \"Jersey\" and her master was put under arrest in Guernsey on 2 April 1993. The skipper, Michel Mesnage, was released on bail on 3 April. A new incident took place on 30 June 1993, when the Guernsey-based trawler \"Sara P\" was seized by the French Navy, and had her pots confiscated.\n\nA spokeswoman for the French fishermen accused the Royal Navy of \"severe provocation\", while the British minister of Agriculture, John Gummer, stated that \"The rule of law must be upheld. I have always emphasised the need for fisheries regulations to be properly enforced throughout the EC. The regulations are there to conserve fish and the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves.\" The British Fisheries junior Minister, David Curry, claimed that the conflict was caused by the French authorities' failure to properly inform their fishermen about the agreement sanctioned by the EU in 1992, and the French legislative election, which in practice left no French government to deal with at the time of the incidents. The British Agriculture Minister had met his elected French counterpart on 1 April, and they had agreed that the 1992 EU decision should be enforced. The French government condemned the fishermen's actions. British and Cherbourg fishermen signed an informal agreement on 5 April, on the first day since the beginning of the crisis, that boats from England and the islands were allowed to unload their catch in France.\n\nA definitive agreement regarding fishing around the Channel Islands and the Contentin peninsula and Brittany was reached after an exchange of notes in Paris, on 16 August 1994.\n\n"}

The first leg was hosted by Boca Juniors at the Estadio Alberto J. Armando in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 11 November 2018, while the second leg will take place outside South America at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Spain (a neutral venue) on 9 December 2018. This is the last final to take place over two legs, as starting from 2019 the final will be played as a single match at a venue chosen in advance. Due to the intense rivalry between Boca and River, the match has been referred to as the \"Superfinal\".\n\nThe second leg was originally to be hosted by River Plate at the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 24 November 2018. However, due to safety concerns resulting from the attack on the bus of Boca Juniors prior to the match, the second leg was moved outside of Argentina and South America, later confirmed to be the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Spain. This will be the first time that the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final will be held in outside South America.\n\nThe winners of the 2018 Copa Libertadores will qualify as the CONMEBOL representative at the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, entering in the semi-finals. They also will earn the right to play against the winners of the 2018 Copa Sudamericana in the 2019 Recopa Sudamericana. The winners also automatically qualify for the group stage of the 2019 Copa Libertadores.\n\nFor the third time, two teams from the same country will face each other in the final, after Brazilian teams met in the 2005 and 2006 finals. Therefore, it will be the first all-Argentine final of the Copa Libertadores, as well as the first final to feature two teams from the same city.\n\nThe 2018 finals will mark the first time that the Superclásico is contested in the Copa Libertadores final (or any final of an international competition), and the third time that the two clubs have met in a cup final, after the 1976 Primera División final and the 2017 Supercopa Argentina.\n\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nThe finals will be played on a home-and-away two-legged basis, with the higher-seeded team (River Plate) originally planned to host the second leg.\n\nThe away goals rule will not be applied, and extra time will be played if the aggregate score is tied after the second leg. If the aggregate score is still tied after extra time, a penalty shoot-out will be used to determine the winner. If extra time is played, a fourth substitution will be allowed.\n\nThe first leg of the final was originally scheduled for 7 November, with the second leg on 28 November 2018 (both on Wednesdays). However, after the finalists were known, CONMEBOL adjusted the dates, with the first leg (hosted by Boca Juniors, the lower seed) on 10 November and the second leg (hosted by River Plate, the higher seed) on 24 November (both Saturdays at 16:00 local time). The Argentine Football Association opposed the date change. Following discussion, the final was moved to 17:00 local time. The first leg was postponed less than two hours before kickoff due to Boca Junior's pitch at the Estadio Alberto J. Armando being waterlogged due to local flooding. The match was rescheduled for the following day, 11 November, with the kickoff moved to 16:00 local time. \nPrior to the second leg of the final on 24 November, the Boca Juniors team bus was attacked en route to River Plate's stadium, the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. Multiple windows on the bus were broken after being hit by projectiles thrown from a crowd surrounding the bus, allowing pepper spray to enter the bus. Multiple players on the bus were injured as a result of the broken glass and pepper spray, with the match delayed by one hour to 18:00 local time. Kickoff was later moved to 18:20 local time, and again to 19:15, before once more being delayed until 19:30. Following the delays, the match was rescheduled for the following day, 25 November, with the same kickoff, 17:00 local time. Former Boca Juniors and River Plate striker Gabriel Batistuta called the attacks \"shameful\".\n\nOn 25 November, prior to the rescheduled second leg, Boca Juniors requested that the match be postponed in order for it to be played under equal conditions, which was not met following the attack. CONMEBOL postponed the match once more as equal conditions were not guaranteed. On 27 November, CONMEBOL confirmed the second leg would be played outside Argentina due to safety concerns, with the match taking place on 8 or 9 December. Subsequently, on 29 November, CONMEBOL confirmed the match would take place at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Spain, on 9 December at 20:30 local time.\n\nFor security reasons, prior to the first leg, both clubs unanimously agreed to prohibit away fans from attending either match. However, following the decision by CONMEBOL to move the second leg to Madrid, these plans were altered, with 5,000 tickets allocated to each club. Additionally, River Plate were reprimanded for the bus attack, fined $400,000, and ordered to play two games behind closed doors in the Estadio Monumental. Real Madrid will sell 25,000 tickets to fans of each team, as many Argentines work in Spain. Security responsibilities for the second leg have been delegated to the Spanish football federation, rather than CONMEBOL, with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez claiming that plans are already underway to have the \"necessary deployments to ensure the event is secure\".\n\nHowever, additional concerns were reputedly raised by both clubs following the decision to move the game to Madrid. Leonardo Ponzio, the River Plate captain, was allegedly involved in a match-fixing scandal during his time at Real Zaragoza, and as such his eligibility to play football in Spain is unclear at present. Meanwhile, there are also reports that Boca Juniors intend to appeal the decision to relocate the second leg. In a subsequent press release, River Plate also announced an intent to protest the CONMEBOL decision to play in Madrid.\n\n<section begin=leg1 /><section end=leg1 />\n\n<section begin=leg2 /><section end=leg2 />\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1546567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1546567", "title": "Altitude tent", "text": "Altitude tent\n\nAn altitude tent is a sealed tent used to simulate a higher altitude with reduced oxygen. The basic concept of living or training at altitude is to cause the body to adapt to the lower oxygen content by producing more oxygen-carrying red blood cells and hemoglobin. Training or spending time at a higher altitude will cause the body to adapt to the higher altitude and provide enhanced performance when returning to a lower altitude. Mountain climbers can use them to avoid altitude sickness, and athletes can use them to enhance performance at lower altitudes.\n\nAltitude tents were first marketed in the mid-1990s, and are provided by many different companies in a number of designs.\n\nSleeping in a simulated altitude environment allows the body to achieve some of the positive adaptations to altitude while still permitting the athlete to perform workouts at an oxygen-rich lower altitude where muscles can perform at their normal work level. An altitude tent is one way to enable athletes living at any elevation to sleep in a high altitude-like environment. A more expensive option gaining popularity amongst professional athletes is to convert their entire bedroom to altitude.\n\nRather than simulating altitude with actual low air pressure (which would require substantial engineering and the use of an airlock to prevent implosion), the altitude tent remains at the ambient air pressure, substituting low concentration of oxygen for low pressure. While normal air contains 20.9% oxygen independent of altitude, the air in an altitude tent contains as little as 12% oxygen (the remainder being nitrogen). The partial pressure of oxygen inside the tent is the same as it is at the natural elevation that the tent is simulating.\n\nMost altitude tents are normobaric which means they create a low-oxygen environment with a “hypoxic air generator” outside the tent pumping the hypoxic (low oxygen) air into the tent which replaces some of the oxygen with nitrogen. The more oxygen-rich air inside the tent is displaced and with it, the excess carbon dioxide exhaled by the occupant(s). Most athletes use altitudes between 8,000 and 15,000 feet. To cause a physiological response, the altitude must be sufficient to reduce blood oxygen saturation (sometimes measured by a pulse oximeter) to approximately 90%.\n\nIn preparation to mountaineering, short-term use (1 week) of an altitude tent for overnight exposure (7.5 hours per night at 3000 m) prior to ascent to actual altitude can increase blood oxygen saturation during sleep and lessen symptoms of acute mountain sickness upon waking, but does not improve exercise performance at altitude .\n\nThe tents themselves come in several styles. Unlike camping tents, altitude tents cannot have much ventilation and often substitute clear plastic windows for the typical nylon and mesh vents. Displaced air escapes the tent through small outlets, seams, or zippers. Air delivery can be through hoses long enough to allow the generator to be placed in a different room, reducing noise. Smaller tents are placed on the bed, with the floor of the tent between mattress and box springs. Larger tents are of a cube shape, often tall enough to stand up in, and set up on the floor with the entire bed, and often a nightstand or two, placed inside. One or more zippered doors allow the occupants to enter and exit with limited loss of effective altitude.\n\nOne challenge with altitude tents is the buildup of heat and humidity. Because of the use of plastic panels to reduce exchange with the room, heat and humidity can build up in an altitude tent. Some tents allow the use of air conditioners to maintain comfortable conditions. Carbon dioxide from the exhaled air can also build up to uncomfortable levels if air exchange is too low. In recent years, advances in altitude tent design, and in the performance of the hypoxic air-supply units, have all resulted in greater air-exchange and significantly lower noise levels.\n\nAn alternative to the sealed altitude tent is the altitude canopy, which drapes over the user's bed, and features a weighted edge instead of a tent floor. The canopy maintains high altitude even though there may be small gaps around the edge by maintaining a high flow rate of hypoxic air through the canopy, effectively preventing room air from entering the gaps. By virtue of smaller internal volumes, canopies come to altitude faster than conventional altitude tents, however, the ever-changing barrier between the canopy and the bedding as the occupant moves during the night results in a less-stable altitude being simulated than with an enclosed tent.\n\nThe ethics of the use of these devices by athletes has been discussed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which claimed that it could be equivalent to blood doping and therefore they should be banned; however, on September 16, 2006, Dick Pound of the WADA announced that \"...the overwhelming consensus of our health, medicine and research committees – was that, at this time, it is not appropriate to do so,\" No explanation was given as to how WADA would have enforced a ban.\n\nThe USADA report on doping in the Lance Armstrong case also indicates that sleeping in an altitude tent can be used to hide doping using EPO, as natural Erythropoietin production is increased, confusing the tests.\n\n"}

{"id": "393610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393610", "title": "Barmy Army", "text": "Barmy Army\n\nThe Barmy Army is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales. Its Registered address is Osbourne House, 143-145 Stanwell Road, Ashford, Middlesex TW15 3QN. The company provides tickets and arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the English cricket team in the UK and overseas. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The term \"barmy\" is English slang for \"mad\".\n\nThe group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994-1995 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans' hopeless audacity in travelling all the way to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting encouragement to the England team even when England were losing quite badly. It was co-founded by Paul Burnham.\n\nThe Barmy Army, which is now a limited company, states that it wants to \"make watching cricket more fun and much more popular\". The group uses flags, banners, songs and chants to encourage the team and crowd participation in their activities. In contrast to the reputations of some sports fans for hooliganism, the Barmy Army organisers actively discourage and avoid such behaviour.\n\nThe group engages in charity work and has gained a good reputation among most cricket administrators. However, many cricket followers find their constant chanting to be annoying and disruptive, particularly during the afternoon sessions of Test matches when the chanting of the Barmy Army, fuelled by their consumption of large amounts of alcohol, often becomes a repetitive, irritating background noise; among others, the renowned cricket writer/commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins accused them of \"demeaning English cricket\".\n\n\"Barmy Army\" was a football chant sung by fans at many grounds, originally sung at Hillsborough by Sheffield Wednesday in the early 1980s. This was because Howard Wilkinson, known as Sergeant Wilko, who was manager at the time inspired the chant, \"Sergeant Wilko's Barmy Army\". In conjunction with the increasing appearance of English football shirts at cricket grounds in the early 1990s, the song's droning, repetitive cry of \"Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army\" transferred to domestic Test cricket arenas at Old Trafford and Headingley. It was particularly apparent during the 1993 Ashes tour.\nThroughout the 1990s, increased spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans to take the song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact that it seemed to represent English fans' activity of standing in the hot sun, drinking lager all day, until they were sunburnt and unwell, it became a description as well as a song. David Lloyd and Ian Botham used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for Sky Sports during England's tours from 1993 to 1995.\n\nOnly in the mid-1990s was the tag recognised as an official title for English touring cricket fans and adopted by what is now recognised as the official Barmy Army.\n\nIn the late 1990s performers Richard Stilgoe and Peter Skellern recognised the need for an anthem for the loyal supporters of a team that regularly seemed to lose and wrote a stirring song called \"The Barmy Army\" which they included in their touring repertoire. It can be found on their 1999 CD \"A Quiet Night Out\" and humorously celebrates the English team's skill at \"snatching defeat from the jaws of victory\".\nMost grounds now set aside areas especially for Barmy Army fans apart from Lord's.\n\nSupporters of English national teams in other sports are also subsidiaries of Barmy Army. The rugby equivalent was formed in 2014, they also form part of the Army to support British and Irish Lions, while there is another separate subsidiary for Rugby League.\n\n"}
{"id": "6974712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6974712", "title": "Blood in the Water match", "text": "Blood in the Water match\n\nThe \"Blood in the Water\" match ( lit. \"Blood bath of Melbourne\"; ) was a water polo match between Hungary and the USSR at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. The match took place on 6 December 1956 against the background of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and saw Hungary defeat the USSR 4–0. The name was coined after Hungarian player Ervin Zádor emerged during the last two minutes with blood pouring from above his eye after being punched by Soviet player Valentin Prokopov.\n\nTensions were already high between the Hungarian and Soviet water polo teams, as the Soviets had taken advantage of their political control of Hungary to study and copy the training methods and tactics of the Olympic champion Hungarians.\n\nThen, on October 23, 1956, a demonstration by students of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics escalated into an uprising against the Soviet puppet government in Budapest. On November 1, Soviet tanks began rolling into Hungary and from November 4 to November 10 forces began suppressing the uprising with air strikes, artillery bombardments, and tank-infantry actions.\n\nAt the time, the Hungarian water polo team was in a mountain training camp above Budapest. They were able to hear the gunfire and see smoke rising. The players were the defending Olympic champions; with the Summer Olympics in Melbourne two months away, they were moved into Czechoslovakia to avoid being caught in the revolution. The players only learned of the true extent of the uprising and the subsequent crackdown after arriving in Australia and they were all anxious for news of friends and family.\n\nBy the start of the Olympics, the uprising had been suppressed and many players saw the Olympics as a way to salvage pride for their country. \"We felt we were playing not just for ourselves but for our whole country\", said Zádor after the match. The match was played in front of a partisan crowd bolstered with expatriate Hungarians (many of whom had been in the boxing arena before to see the Hungarian László Papp) as well as Australians and Americans, two of the Soviet Union's Cold War opponents.\n\nIn the morning before the start, the Hungarians had created a strategy to taunt the Russians, whose language they had studied in school. In the words of Ervin Zádor: \"We had decided to try and make the Russians angry to distract them.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, kicks and punches were exchanged. At one point, a punch thrown by Hungarian captain Dezső Gyarmati was caught on film. Meanwhile, Zádor scored two goals to the crowd's cheers of \"Hajrá Magyarok!\" (\"Go Hungarians!\").\n\nBy the final minutes of the match, Hungary was leading 4–0. Zádor was marking Valentin Prokopov, with whom he had already exchanged words. Prokopov struck him, causing a bleeding gash. Zádor left the pool and his bleeding was the final straw for a crowd already in frenzy. Many angry spectators jumped onto the concourse beside the water, shook their fists, shouted abuse and spat at the Russians. To avoid a riot, police entered the arena and shepherded the crowd away. One minute of the match remained.\nPictures of Zádor's injuries were published around the world, leading to the \"Blood in the Water\" moniker. Reports that the water in the pool turned red were, however, an exaggeration. Zádor said his only thought was whether he would be able to play the next match.\n\nHungary was declared the winner since they had been leading and then beat Yugoslavia 2–1 in the final to win their fourth Olympic gold medal. Zádor's injury would force him to miss the match. After the event was completed, he and some of his teammates sought asylum in the West, rather than returning to live in a Hungary under a firmly pro-Soviet regime.\n\nIn 2006, for the 50th anniversary of the attempted Hungarian Revolution, the documentary \"Freedom's Fury\", produced by Kristine Lacey and Thor Halvorssen, told the story of the match. Quentin Tarantino described it as \"the best untold story ever\". The documentary was narrated by the legendary Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, who, as a teenager had been coached by Ervin Zádor.\n\nAlso in 2006, a feature film about the match was released, entitled \"Children of Glory\" (Hungarian title: \"Szabadság, szerelem\", meaning \"Freedom, love\", after the lines of Sándor Petőfi, the martyred poet of the 1848–49 revolution). The movie shows the Hungarian Revolution through the eyes of a player on the water polo team and a young woman who is one of the student leaders. It was directed by Krisztina Goda, and produced by Andrew G. Vajna. The movie appeared in Hungarian cinemas on 23 October 2006, the 50th anniversary of the revolution. On 29 October 2006, it was shown at the White House for President George W. Bush and guests (including Hungarian-American figures such as George Pataki, Governor of New York and George A. Olah, Nobel Prize winner).\n\nThe incident also features in the 1978 Australian film \"Newsfront\".\n\n"}

{"id": "29560406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29560406", "title": "Bud Light Daredevils", "text": "Bud Light Daredevils\n\nThe Bud Light Daredevils were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998. The show combined gymnastics, trampoline, acrobatics, and basketball. The team was started by University of Mississippi cheerleaders Ty Cobb, Sam Martin, Robert Kirby, Tyler Hubbard, John White, and Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb.\n\nIn 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as Ole Miss Rebels mascot Colonel Reb) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic \"flip dunk\" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games.\n\nIn 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini-trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the Southeastern Conference (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games.\n\nWith the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called \"The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show\". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to National Basketball Association (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the \"Ole Miss Cheerleaders\" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the San Antonio Spurs in 1980, followed by shows for the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nStill in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the \"flip-pass\" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk (\"Congo Dunk\" 1987).\n\nFollowing his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13]\n\nIn 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of \"Dixie Daredevils\". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14]\n\nIn the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14]\n\nDuring the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and Guy Cobb performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called \"Budweiser Light\".[2]\nBoth Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer \"Budweiser Light\" to \"Bud Light\". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15]\n\nFrom 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10]\n\nAnheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18]\n\n"}
{"id": "13012048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13012048", "title": "Captain (baseball)", "text": "Captain (baseball)\n\nIn baseball, a captain is an honorary title sometimes given to a member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by managers and coaches, such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, and encouraging teamwork. In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players and to encourage teamwork and improvement.\n\nMajor League Baseball's official rules only briefly mention the position of team captain. Official Baseball Rule 4.03 Comment (formerly Rule 4.01 Comment) which discusses the submission of a team's lineup to the umpire, notes that obvious errors in the lineup should be brought to the attention of the team's manager or captain.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, only a handful of teams have designated a player as captain in recent years, and there are no current team captains. Jerry Remy, who was named as captain of the California Angels in 1977 at age 24, explains that in today's modern age of baseball, \"there's probably no need for a captain on a major league team. I think there are guys who lead by example. You could name the best player on your team as captain, but he may not be the guy other players will talk to or who will quietly go to other players and give them a prod.\" They do not wear an NHL-style \"C\" on their jersey. Retired first baseman Mike Sweeney, former captain of the Kansas City Royals from 2003 to 2007, wore the \"C\" patch, as did two other recently retired captains: John Franco of the Mets, and Jason Varitek of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, the captain held most of the on-field responsibilities that are held by managers and coaches in modern baseball. For example, according to the 1898 official rules, the captain was responsible for assigning the players' positions and batting order, for appealing to the umpire if he observed certain violations (for example, if the other team intentionally discolored the ball or its players illegally left the bench), and for informing the umpire of any special ground rules. During a period when teams didn't carry full-time coaches, the captain and one or more other players could serve as \"coachers\" of the base runners; the lines setting off the section where they were allowed to stand were designated as \"captain's lines.\" If the umpire made a decision that could \"be plainly shown by the code of rules to have been illegal\", the \"captain alone shall be allowed to make the appeal for reversal.\" The rules state that the captain must be one of the nine players, implying that a non-playing manager would not have been allowed to act in the captain's role. In contrast with modern baseball, the 1898 rules do not mention the managers having any rights to interact with the umpires. The rules allowed managers to sit on the team's bench during the game, but were otherwise silent with respect to rights and responsibilities of managers.\n\nIn early baseball, many teams had playing managers who had both the off-field responsibilities of managers and the on-field responsibilities of captains. They held the title of \"manager-captain.\" In contrast, teams that had non-playing managers hired a player to serve as captain. For example, in early 1902 Jack Doyle was signed as captain and first baseman of the New York Giants while non-player Horace Fogel was manager.\n\nThough the role of a captain has been significant in the histories of teams such as the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the San Francisco Giants, other teams, such as the Milwaukee Brewers, have, as of 2016, never had a captain.\n\n\n"}

Expectations can be high for chess prodigies. While some become World Champions, others show little or no progress in adulthood.\n\nEarly chess prodigies were Paul Morphy (1837–1884) and José Raúl Capablanca (1888–1942), both of whom won matches against strong adult opponents at the age of 12, and Samuel Reshevsky (1911–1992), who was giving simultaneous exhibitions at the age of six. Morphy went on to be unofficial World Champion (before the official title existed), Capablanca became the third World Champion, and Reshevsky—while never attaining the title—was amongst the top few players in the world for many decades.\n\nOne measure of chess prodigies (since 1950, when the title was introduced) is the age at which they gain the Grandmaster title.

{"id": "185365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185365", "title": "Cod Wars", "text": "Cod Wars\n\nThe Cod Wars (, \"the cod wars\", or \"Landhelgisstríðin\", \"the wars for the territorial waters\") were a series of confrontations between the United Kingdom and Iceland on fishing rights in the North Atlantic. Each of the disputes ended with an Icelandic victory. The Third Cod War concluded in 1976, with a highly favourable agreement for Iceland; the United Kingdom conceded to a Icelandic exclusive fishery zone after threats that Iceland would withdraw from NATO, which would have forfeited NATO's access to most of the GIUK gap, a critical anti-submarine warfare during the Cold War.\n\nAs a result, British fishing communities lost access to rich areas and were devastated, with thousands of jobs lost. Since 1982, a exclusive economic zone has been the United Nations standard.\n\nThe term \"cod war\" was coined by a British journalist in early September 1958. None of the Cod Wars met any of the common thresholds for a conventional war, and they may more accurately be described as militarised interstate disputes. There is only one confirmed death during the Cod Wars: an Icelandic engineer, who was accidentally killed in the Second Cod War. While he was repairing damage on the Icelandic gunboat \"Ægir\" after a collision with the British frigate \"Apollo\", they collided again, on 29 August 1973.\n\nSeveral explanations for the Cod Wars have been put forward. Recent studies have focused on the underlying economic, legal and strategic drivers for Iceland and the United Kingdom, as well as the domestic and international factors that contributed to the escalation of the dispute. Lessons drawn from the Cod Wars have been applied to international relations theory.\n\nFishermen from Britain began to fish in the international waters near Iceland in the 15th century. From the early 16th century onward, English sailors and fishermen were a major presence in the waters off Iceland. Some Icelandic historians view the history of Iceland's struggle for control of its maritime resources in ten episodes, or ten cod wars. The first episode was a dispute between Norway and England in 1415 to 1425 over England's trading with Iceland in violation of Norway's monopoly on the Icelandic trade. The dispute ended when the English arrested Eric of Pomerania's officials in Iceland, effectively restoring the Anglo-Icelandic trade. The agreement that was reached in 1976 concluded what in modern times is called the Third Cod War (the final and tenth Cod War in long-term history).\n\nWith the increases in range of fishing that were enabled by steam power in the late 19th century, boat owners and skippers felt pressure to exploit new grounds. Their large catches in Icelandic waters attracted more regular voyages across the North Atlantic. In 1893, the Danish government, which then governed Iceland and the Faroe Islands, claimed a fishing limit of around their shores. British trawler owners disputed the claim and continued to send their ships to the waters near Iceland. The British government did not recognise the Danish claim on the grounds that setting such a precedent would lead to similar claims by the nations around the North Sea, which would damage the British fishing industry.\n\nIn 1896, the United Kingdom made an agreement with Denmark for British vessels to use any Icelandic port for shelter if they stowed their gear and trawl nets. In return, British vessels were not to fish in Faxa Bay east of a line from Ílunýpa, a promontory near Keflavík to Þormóðssker (43.43° N, 22.30° W).\n\nWith many British trawlers being charged and fined by Danish gunboats for fishing illegally within the limit, which the British government refused to recognise, the British press began to enquire why the Danish action against British interests was allowed to continue without intervention by the Royal Navy. The British made a show of naval force (gunboat diplomacy) in 1896 and 1897.\n\nIn April 1899, the steam trawler \"Caspian\" was fishing off the Faroe Islands when a Danish gunboat tried to arrest her for allegedly fishing illegally inside the limits. The trawler refused to stop and was fired upon first with blank shells and then with live ammunition. Eventually, the trawler was caught, but before the skipper, Charles Henry Johnson, left his ship to go aboard the Danish gunboat, he ordered the mate to make a dash for it after he went on to the Danish ship. The \"Caspian\" set off at full speed. The gunboat fired several shots at the unarmed boat but could not catch up with the trawler, which returned, heavily damaged, to Grimsby, England. On board the Danish gunboat, the skipper of the \"Caspian\" was lashed to the mast. A court held at Thorshavn convicted him on several counts including illegal fishing and attempted assault, and he was jailed for 30 days.\n\nThe Anglo-Danish Territorial Waters Agreement of 1901, which set territorial limits, measured narrowly, for Iceland for 50 years.\n\nThe Icelandic fisheries grew in importance for the British fishing industry around the end of the 19th century. The reduction in fishing activity brought about by the hostilities of the First World War effectively ended the dispute for a time.\n\nWhile data is incomplete for the prewar period, one historian argues that the Icelandic fishing grounds were 'very important' to the British fishing industry as a whole. Data from 1919 to 1938 showed a significant increase in the British total catches in Icelandic waters. The British catches in Iceland were more than twice the combined catches of all other grounds of the British distant water fleet. Icelanders grew increasingly dismayed at the British presence.\n\nIn October 1949, Iceland initiated the two-year abrogation process of the agreement made between Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1901. The fishery limits to the north of Iceland were extended to . However, since the British trawling fleet did not use those ground, the northern extension was not a source of significant contention between the two states. Initially planning to extend the rest of its fishery limits by the end of the two-year abrogation period, Iceland chose to postpone its extension to wait for the outcome of the UK-Norway fisheries case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was decided in December 1951.\n\nIcelanders were satisfied with the ICJ ruling, as they believed that Iceland's preferred extensions were similar to those afforded to Norway in the ICJ ruling. The UK and Iceland tried to negotiate a solution but were unable to reach agreement. The Icelandic government declared, on 19 March 1952, its intention to extend its fishery limits on 15 May 1952.\n\nIceland and the United Kingdom were involved in a dispute from May 1952 to November 1956 over Iceland's unilateral extension of its fishery limits from . Unlike in the Cod Wars, the Royal Navy was never sent into Icelandic waters. The British trawling industry, however, implemented costly sanctions on Iceland by imposing a landing ban on Icelandic fish in British ports. The landing ban was a major blow to the Icelandic fishing industry (the UK was Iceland's largest export market for fish) and caused consternation among Icelandic statesmen. The two sides decided to refer one part of the Icelandic extension to the ICJ in early 1953: the controversial Faxa Bay delimitation.\n\nCold War politics proved favourable for Iceland, as the Soviet Union, seeking influence in Iceland, stepped in to purchase Icelandic fish. The United States, fearing greater Soviet influence in Iceland, also did so and persuaded Spain and Italy to do likewise.\n\nSoviet and American involvement resulted in weakening the punitive effects of the British landing ban. Some scholars refer to the dispute of 1952 to 1956 as one of the Cod Wars, as the object of the dispute and its costs and risks were all similar to those in the other three Cod Wars.\n\nJust as the other Cod Wars, the dispute ended with Iceland achieving its aims, as the Icelandic fishery limits were recognized by the United Kingdom, following a decision by the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation in 1956.\n\nTwo years later, in 1958, the United Nations convened the first International Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was attended by 86 states. Several countries sought to extend the limits of their territorial waters to , but the conference did not reach any firm conclusions.\n\nThe First Cod War lasted from 1 September 1958 to 11 March 1961. It began as soon as a new Icelandic law came into force and expanded the Icelandic fishery zone from at midnight on 1 September 1958.\n\nAll members of NATO opposed the unilateral Icelandic extension. The British declared that their trawlers would fish under protection from their warships in three areas: out of the Westfjords, north of Horn and southeast of Iceland. In all, twenty British trawlers, four warships and a supply vessel were inside the newly declared zones. The deployment was expensive; in February 1960, Lord Carrington, the First Lord of the Admiralty, responsible for the Royal Navy, stated that the ships near Iceland had expended half a million pounds sterling worth of oil since the new year and that a total of 53 British warships had taken part in the operations. Against that, Iceland could deploy seven patrol vessels and a single PBY-6A Catalina flying boat.\n\nThe deployment of the Royal Navy to contested waters led to protests in Iceland. Demonstrations against the British embassy were met with taunts by the British ambassador, Andrew Gilchrist, as he played bagpipe music and military marches on his gramophone. Many incidents followed. The Icelanders were, however, at a disadvantage in patrolling the contested waters because of the size of the area and the limited number of patrol ships. According to one historian, 'only the flagship Thór could effectively arrest and, if necessary, tow a trawler to harbour'.\n\nOn 4 September ICGV \"Ægir\", an Icelandic patrol vessel, attempted to take a British trawler off the Westfjords but was thwarted when HMS \"Russell\" intervened, and the two vessels collided. On 6 October, V/s \"María Júlía\" fired three shots at the trawler \"Kingston Emerald\", forcing the trawler to escape to sea. On 12 November, V/s \"Þór\" encountered the trawler \"Hackness\", which had not stowed its nets legally. \"Hackness\" did not stop until \"Þór\" had fired two blanks and one live shell off its bow. Once again, HMS \"Russell\" came to the rescue, and its shipmaster ordered the Icelandic captain to leave the trawler alone, as it was not within the limit recognised by the British government. The captain of \"Þór\"', Eiríkur Kristófersson, said that he would not do so and ordered his men to approach the trawler with the gun manned. In response, the \"Russell\" threatened to sink the Icelandic boat if it fired a shot at the \"Hackness\". More British ships then arrived, and the \"Hackness\" retreated.\n\nIcelandic officials threatened to withdraw Iceland's membership of NATO and to expel US forces from Iceland unless a satisfactory conclusion could be reached to the dispute. Even the cabinet members who were pro-Western (proponents of NATO and the US Defence Agreement) were forced to resort to the threats, as that was Iceland's chief leverage, and it would have been political suicide not to use it. Thus, NATO engaged in formal and informal mediations to bring an end to the dispute.\n\nFollowing the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea between 1960 and 1961, the UK and Iceland came to a settlement in late February 1961, which stipulated Icelandic fishery limits but that Britain would have fishing rights in allocated zones and under certain seasons in the outer for three years. The Icelandic Althing approved the agreement on 11 March 1961.\n\nThe deal was very similar to one that Iceland had offered in the weeks and days leading up to its unilateral extension in 1958. As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that any future disagreement between Iceland and Britain in the matter of fishery zones would be sent to the International Court of Justice, in the Hague.\n\nThe Second Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland lasted from September 1972 until the signing of a temporary agreement, in November 1973.\n\nThe Icelandic government again extended its fishing limits, now to . It had two goals in extending the limits: (1) to conserve fish stocks and (2) to increase its share of total catches. The reasons that Iceland pursued 50 nmi fishery limits, rather than the 200 nmi limits that they had also considered, were that the most fruitful fishing grounds were within the 50 nmi and that patrolling a 200 nmi limit would have been more difficult.\n\nThe British contested the Icelandic extension with two goals in mind: (1) to achieve the greatest possible catch quota for British fishermen in the contested waters and (2) to prevent a \"de facto\" recognition of a unilateral extension of a fishery jurisdiction, which would set a precedent for other extensions.\n\nAll Western European states and the Warsaw Pact opposed Iceland's unilateral extension. African states declared support for Iceland's extension after a meeting in 1971 where the Icelandic prime minister argued that the Icelandic cause was a part of a broader battle against colonialism and imperialism.\n\nOn 1 September 1972, the enforcement of the law that expanded the Icelandic fishery limits to began. Numerous British and West German trawlers continued fishing within the new zone on the first day. The Icelandic leftist coalition then governing ignored the treaty that stipulated the involvement of the International Court of Justice. It said that it was not bound by agreements made by the previous centre-right government, with Lúdvik Jósepsson, the fisheries minister, stating that 'the basis for our independence is economic independence'. The next day, ICGV \"Ægir\" chased 16 trawlers, in waters east of the country, out of the 50 nmi zone. The Icelandic Coast Guard started to use net cutters to cut the trawling lines of non-Icelandic vessels fishing within the new exclusion zone.\n\nOn 5 September 1972, at 10:25, ICGV \"Ægir\", under Guðmundur Kjærnested's command, encountered an unmarked trawler fishing northeast of Hornbanki. The master of the black-hulled trawler refused to divulge the trawler's name and number and, after being warned to follow the Coast Guard's orders, played \"Rule, Britannia!\" over the radio. At 10:40, the net cutter was deployed into the water for the first time, and \"Ægir\" sailed along the trawler's port side. The fishermen tossed a thick nylon rope into the water as the patrol ship closed in, attempting to disable its propeller. After passing the trawler, \"Ægir\" veered to the trawler's starboard side. The net cutter, behind the patrol vessel, sliced one of the trawling wires. As ICGV \"Ægir\" came about to circle the unidentified trawler, its angry crew threw coal as well as waste and a large fire axe at the Coast Guard vessel. A considerable amount of swearing and shouting came through the radio, which resulted in the trawler being identified as \"Peter Scott\" (H103).\n\nOn 25 November 1972, a crewman on the German trawler \"Erlangen\" suffered a head injury as an Icelandic patrolship cut the trawler's trawling wire, which struck the crewman. On 18 January 1973, the nets of 18 trawlers were cut. That forced the British seamen to leave the Icelandic fishery zone unless they had the protection of the Royal Navy. The next day large, fast tugboats were sent to their defence, the first being the \"Statesman\". The British considered that to be insufficient and formed a special group to defend the trawlers.\n\nOn 23 January 1973, the volcano Eldfell on Heimaey erupted, forcing the Coast Guard to divert its attention to rescuing the inhabitants of the small island.\n\nOn 17 May 1973, the British trawlers left the Icelandic waters, only to return two days later when they were escorted by British frigates. The naval deployment was codenamed Operation Dewey. Hawker Siddeley Nimrod jets flew over the contested waters and notified British frigates and trawlers of the whereabouts of Icelandic patrolships. Icelandic statesmen were infuriated by the entry of the Royal Navy and considered to appeal to the UN Security Council or call for Article 5 of the NATO Charter to be implemented. According to the American ambassador at the time, Frederick Irving, Ólafur Jóhannesson demanded for the US to send jets to bomb the British frigates. There were major protests in Reykjavík on 24 May 1973. All the windows of the British embassy in Reykjavík were broken.\n\nThe Icelandic lighthouse tender V/s \"Árvakur\" collided with four British vessels on 1 June, and six days later ICGV \"Ægir\" collided with HMS \"Scylla\", when it was reconnoitring for icebergs off the Westfjords even though no trawlers were present.\n\nOn 29 August the Icelandic Coast Guard suffered the only fatality of the conflict, when ICGV \"Ægir\" collided with another British frigate. Halldór Hallfreðsson, an engineer on board the Icelandic vessel, died by electrocution from his welding equipment after sea water flooded the compartment in which he was making hull repairs.\n\nOn 16 September 1973, Joseph Luns, Secretary-General of NATO, arrived in Reykjavík to talk with Icelandic ministers, who had been pressed to leave NATO, as it had been of no help to Iceland in the conflict. Britain and Iceland were both NATO members. The Royal Navy made use of bases in Iceland during the Cold War to fulfill its primary NATO duty, guarding the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap.\n\nAfter a series of talks within NATO, British warships were recalled on 3 October. Trawlermen played \"Rule Britannia!\" over their radios, as they had done when the Royal Navy entered the waters. They also played \"The Party's Over\". An agreement was signed on 8 November to limit British fishing activities to certain areas inside the 50 nmi limit. The agreement, resolving the dispute, was approved by the Althing on 13 November 1973. The agreement was based on the premise that British trawlers would limit their annual catch to no more than 130,000 tons. The Icelanders were reportedly prepared to settle for 156,000 tons in July 1972 but had increased their demands by spring of 1973 and coffered 117,000 tons (the British demanded 145,000 tons in spring 1973). The agreement expired in November 1975, and the third \"Cod War\" began.\n\nThe Second Cod War threatened Iceland's membership in NATO and the US military presence in Iceland. It was the closest that Iceland has come to canceling its bilateral Defence Agreement with the US.\n\nIcelandic NATO membership and hosting of US military had considerable importance to Cold War strategy because of Iceland's location in the middle of the GIUK gap.\n\nAfter the entry of the Royal Navy into the contested waters, at any given time, four frigates and an assortment of tugboats would generally protect the British trawling fleet. Over the course of this Cod War, a total of 32 British frigates had entered the contested waters.\n\nOn 19 July 1974, more than nine months after the signing of the agreement, one of the largest wet fish stern trawlers in the British fleet, \"C.S. Forester\", which had been fishing inside the limit, was shelled and captured by the Icelandic gunboat V/s \"Þór\" after a pursuit. \"C. S. Forester\" was shelled with non-explosive ammunition after repeated warnings. The trawler was hit by at least two rounds, which damaged the engine room and a water tank. She was later boarded and towed to Iceland. Skipper Richard Taylor was condemned to 30 days of imprisonment and fined £5,000. He was released on bail after the owners paid £2,232. The trawler was also allowed to depart with a catch of 200 tons of fish. Also, her owners paid a total of £26,300 for the release of the ship.\n\nAt the third United Nations Conference of the Law on the Sea in 1975, several countries supported a limit to territorial waters. On 15 July 1975, the Icelandic government announced its intention to extend its fishery limits. The Third Cod War (November 1975 – June 1976) began after Iceland again extended its fishing limits, now to from its coast. The British government did not recognise the large increase to the exclusion zone and so an issue occurred with British fishermen and their activity in the disputed zone. The conflict, which was the most hard-fought of the Cod Wars, saw British fishing trawlers have their nets cut by the Icelandic Coast Guard, and there were several incidents of ramming by Icelandic ships and British trawlers, frigates and tugboats.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents occurred on 11 December 1975. As reported by Iceland, V/s \"Þór\", under the command of Helgi Hallvarðsson, was leaving port at Seyðisfjörður, where it had been minesweeping, when orders were received to investigate the presence of unidentified foreign vessels at the mouth of the fjord. The vessels were identified as three British ships: \"Lloydsman\", an oceangoing tug three times bigger than V/s \"Þór\"; \"Star Aquarius\", an oil rig supply vessel of British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and her sister ship, \"Star Polaris\". They were sheltering from a force nine gale within Iceland's territorial waters. In the Icelandic account, when ordered to leave Icelandic territorial waters by the commander of \"Þór\", the three tugboats initially complied. However, around two nautical miles (4 km) from the coast, \"Star Aquarius\" allegedly veered to starboard and hit \"Þór\"s port side as the Coast Guards attempted to overtake her. Even as \"Þór\" increased speed, \"Lloydsman\" again collided with its port side. \"Þór\" had suffered considerable damage by these hits and so when \"Star Aquarius\" came about, a blank round was fired from \"Þór\". That did not deter \"Star Aquarius\", as it hit \"Þór\" a second time. Another shot was fired from \"Þór\" as a result, this time a live round that hit the bow of \"Star Aquarius\". Then, the tugboats retreated. V/s \"Þór\", which was close to sinking after the confrontation, sailed to Loðmundarfjörður for temporary repairs.\n\nThe British reports of the incident differ considerably and maintain that \"Þór\" attempted to board one of the tugboats, and as \"Þór\" broke away, \"Lloydsman\" surged forward to protect \"Star Aquarius\". Captain Albert MacKenzie of \"Star Aquarius\" said that \"Þór\" approached from the stern and hit the support vessel before it veered off and fired a shot from a range of about . Niels Sigurdsson, the Icelandic Ambassador in London, said that \"Þór\" had been firing in self-defence after it had been rammed by British vessels. Iceland consulted the UN Security Council over the incident, which declined to intervene.\n\nThe immediate Royal Navy response was to dispatch a large frigate force, which was already well on the way to Icelandic waters, before the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, or the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, were informed. The Royal Navy saw the opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of its older Type 12 and Type 81 frigates for sustained deployment in the area of the Denmark Strait, where they were expected to deter the passage of Soviet submarines while the Royal Navy was threatened by further serious defence and naval cuts by the Royal Navy's chief \"bête noire\", the Chancellor of Exchequer and former Minister of Defence, Denis Healey. The Royal Navy saw its strategic aim at the time to be as much as fighting Healey as the Soviet Navy. The Second and Third Cod Wars were necessary wars for the Royal Navy, like the Falklands Operation, six years later. To Crosland, also MP for the trawler port of Grimsby, the third war was a more serious threat to the Western Alliance than the Middle East was.\n\nAnother incident occurred in January 1976, when HMS \"Andromeda\" collided with \"Þór\", which sustained a hole in its hull; the hull of \"Andromeda\" was dented. The British Ministry of Defence said that the collision represented a \"deliberate attack\" on the British warship 'without regard for life'. The Icelandic Coast Guard, on the other hand insisted, that \"Andromeda\" had rammed \"Þór\" by \"overtaking the boat and then swiftly changing course'. After the incident and facing a growing number of ships enduring dockyard repairs, the Royal Navy ordered a 'more cautious approach' in dealing with 'the enemy cutting the trawlers' warps'.\n\nOn 19 February 1976, the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced that a fisherman from Grimsby had become the first British casualty of the Third Cod War, when a hawser hit and seriously injured him after Icelandic vessels cut a trawl. While a British parliamentary source reported in a 1993 debate that a British trawlerman was accidentally killed by a solid shot fired by an Icelandic patrol boat, this suggestion has not been corroborated by any historical sources.\n\nBritain deployed a total of 22 frigates and ordered the reactivation from reserve of the Type 41 frigate HMS \"Jaguar\" and Type 61 HMS \"Lincoln\", refitting them as specialist ramming craft with reinforced wooden bows. In addition to the frigates, the British also deployed a total of seven supply ships, nine tugboats and three support ships to protect its fishing trawlers, but only six to nine of the vessels were on deployment at any one time. The Royal Navy was prepared to accept serious damage to its Cold War frigate fleet, costing millions and disabling part of its North Atlantic capacity for more than a year. HMS \"Yarmouth\" had its bow torn off, HMS \"Diomede\" had a 40 ft gash ripped through its hull and HMS \"Eastbourne\" suffered such structural damage from ramming by Icelandic gunboats that it had to be reduced to a moored operational training frigate. Iceland deployed four patrol vessels (V/s \"Óðinn\", V/s \"Þór\", V/s \"Týr\", and V/s \"Ægir\") and two armed trawlers (V/s \"Baldur\" and V/s \"Ver\"). The Icelandic government tried to acquire US Asheville class gunboats and when it was denied by Henry Kissinger, it tried to acquire Soviet Mirka class frigates instead.\n\nA more serious turn of events came when Iceland threatened closure of the NATO base at Keflavík, which would have severely impaired NATO's ability to deny access to the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet Union. As a result, the British government agreed to have its fishermen stay outside Iceland's exclusion zone without a specific agreement.\n\nOn the evening of 6 May 1976, after the outcome of the Third Cod War had already been decided, the V/s \"Týr\" was trying to cut the nets of the trawler \"Carlisle\" when Captain Gerald Plumer of HMS \"Falmouth\" ordered it rammed. \"Falmouth\" at the speed of more than 22 knots (41 km/h) rammed \"Týr\", almost capsizing her. \"Týr\" did not sink and managed to cut the nets of \"Carlisle\", and \"Falmouth\" rammed it again. \"Týr\" was heavily damaged and found herself propelled by only a single screw and pursued by the tug-boat \"Statesman\". In the dire situation, Captain Guðmundur Kjærnested gave orders to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of firepower HMS \"Falmouth\" enjoyed, to deter any further ramming. The Third Cod War saw 55 ramming incidents altogether.\n\nIn NATO-mediated sessions, an agreement was reached between Iceland and the UK on 1 June 1976. The British were allowed to keep 24 trawlers within the 200 nmi and fish a total of 30,000 tons.\n\nWhile Iceland came closest to withdrawing from NATO and expelling US forces in the Second Cod War, Iceland actually took the most serious action in all of the Cod Wars in the Third Cod War by ending diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 19 February 1976. Although Icelandic government was firmly pro-Western, the government linked Iceland's NATO membership with the outcomes of the fishery dispute. If a favorable outcome could not be reached, Iceland implied that it would withdraw from NATO. However, the government never explicitly linked the US Defence Agreement to the outcome of the dispute.\n\nIceland achieved its overall aims. As a result, the already-declining British fisheries were hit hard by being excluded from their prime fishing grounds and the economies of the large northern fishing ports in the United Kingdom, such as Grimsby, Hull, and Fleetwood, were severely affected, with thousands of skilled fishermen and people in related trades being put out of work. The cost for repairing the damaged Royal Navy frigates was probably over £1 million.\n\nIn 2012, the British government offered a multimillion-pound compensation deal and apology to fishermen who lost their livelihoods in the 1970s. More than 35 years after the workers lost their jobs, the £1,000 compensation offered to 2,500 fisherman was criticised for being insufficient and excessively delayed.\n\nA 2016 review article finds that the underlying drivers behind the desire to extend fishery limits were economic and legal for Iceland, but they were economic and strategic for the United Kingdom. It, however, argues that \"these underlying causes account for the tensions but are not enough to explain why bargaining failure occurred\". After all, the outbreak of each Cod War was costly and risky for both sides.\n\nSeveral factors are mentioned to explain why bargaining failure occurred. The nature of nationalism and party competition for Iceland and pressure from the trawling industry for Britain are reasons that both sides took actions that were of noticeable risk to their broader security interests. Interdepartmental competition and unilateral behaviour by individual diplomats were also factors, with the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries influencing the British government's decision 'more than the Foreign Office'.\n\nA 2017 study argues that both a combination of powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and miscalculation by those statesmen contributed to the outbreak of the Cod Wars. The study argues that Iceland won each of the Cod Wars because Icelandic statesmen were too greatly constrained by domestic politics to offer compromises to the British, but British statesmen were not as constrained by public opinion at home.\n\nInternational relations scholars such as Robert Keohane, Joseph Nye, Hans Morgenthau, Henry Kissinger and Ned Lebow have written on the Cod Wars.\n\nThe 2016 review article finds that lessons from the Cod Wars have most commonly been applied to liberal and realist international relations theory and theories on asymmetric bargaining. It claims that the Cod Wars are widely seen as inconsistent with the precepts of the liberal peace, since democracy, trade and institutions are supposed to pacify interstate behavior. The Cod Wars are also held up as an example of the decreasing salience of hard power in international relations, with implications for realist theory which emphasizes the importance of hard power. Theorists on asymmetric bargaining have emphasized how Iceland, lacking structural power, can still have an issue power advantage, with its greater commitment to the cause.\n\nA 2017 study argues that the occurrence of the Cod Wars is inconsistent with liberal international relations theory, including the democratic peace thesis, as the \"supposedly pacifying factors of the liberal peace – democracy, trade and institutional ties – effectively made the disputes more contentious\".\n\nThe Cod Wars are often mentioned in Icelandic and British news reporting when either state is involved in a fishery dispute or when there are disputes of some sort between the two countries. The Cod Wars were extensively covered by media during the Icesave dispute between Iceland and the UK, and in preparation for the Iceland-England match at the round of 16 in Euro 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, the crews of two ships involved in the Cod Wars, the Hull trawler \"Arctic Corsair\" and the Icelandic patrolship \"Odinn\", exchanged bells in a gesture of goodwill and sign of friendship between the cities of Hull and Reykjavík. The event was part of a project by Hull Museums on the history between Iceland and the United Kingdom during and after the Cod Wars.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "245878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245878", "title": "Ephedra", "text": "Ephedra\n\nEphedra is a medicinal preparation from the plant \"Ephedra sinica\". Several additional species belonging to the genus \"Ephedra\" have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a possible candidate for the Soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. Native Americans and Mormon pioneers drank a tea brewed from other \"Ephedra\" species, called \"Mormon tea\" and \"Indian tea\".\nIn recent years, dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids have been found to be unsafe, with reports of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths. In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004. The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ephedra extracts not containing ephedrine have not been banned by the FDA and are still sold legally today.\n\nA wide variety of alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of \"ephedra\". Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in \"ephedra\" (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.\n\nEphedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug, despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance. Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.\n\nEphedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained. However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.\n\nAdverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nThere are no formal requirements for standardization or quality control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch. Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand.\n\nEscalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.\n\nIn 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nIn response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe. The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.\n\nMetabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA. Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.\n\nIn addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas. \"Business Week\" reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been \"beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying.\"\n\nIn 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.\n\nA review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in 2000, found a number of cases of sudden cardiac death or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages. Subsequently, in response to pressure from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, Metabolife was compelled by the Department of Justice in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from insomnia to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA. Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Korey Stringer from heatstroke in 2001.\n\nSteve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003. The medical examiner found that ephedra toxicity played a \"significant role\" in Bechler's sudden death. Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \"All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act.\"\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that \"...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist\", and called FDA action to regulate ephedra \"long overdue.\"\n\nIn response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects. Almost simultaneously, a study in \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or \"Ginkgo biloba\".\n\nOn December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements. Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that \"...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately.\" Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.\n\nNutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.\n\nEphedrine is listed as a banned substance by both the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. The National Football League banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Korey Stringer; ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death. The substance is also banned by the National Basketball Association. Nonetheless, ephedra remains widely used by athletes; a 2006 survey of collegiate hockey players found that nearly half had used ephedra believing it enhanced their athletic performance.\n\nIn the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Argentine footballer Diego Armando Maradona tested positive for ephedrine. The Japanese motorcycle racer Noriyuki Haga tested positive for ephedrine in 2000, being disqualified from two races and banned from two more as a result. NFL punter Todd Sauerbrun of the Denver Broncos was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedrine.\n\n\n"}

There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as English billiards.\nThe term \"\" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe labels \"British\" and \"UK\" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the British Empire and/or are part of the Commonwealth of Nations, as opposed to US (and, often, Canadian) terminology. The terms \"American\" or \"US\" as applied here refer generally to North American usage. However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.\n\nThe term \"blackball\" is used in this glossary to refer to both blackball and eight-ball pool as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand. Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous (\"eight-ball pool\" is too easily confused with the related \"eight-ball\"), and blackball is globally standardized by an International Olympic Committee-recognized governing body, the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American , and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets. (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and nine-ball draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)\n\nForeign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. ), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.\n\n In Russian pyramid, the cue ball is usually red, but any ball can be used as a cue ball, with the exception of \"dynamic pyramid\" variant.\n"}

The term was coined by San Diego Padres player Carmelo Martínez in the 1980s and first appeared in print when Leon Durham was quoted as using it in 1984. \n\nThe \"Olympic Rings\" or platinum sombrero applies to a player striking out five times in a game, while a horn (after Sam Horn of the Baltimore Orioles, who accomplished the feat in an extra-inning game in 1991), titanium sombrero or double platinum sombrero is bestowed upon a player who strikes out six times in a single game. The term \"Horn\" for a six-strikeout game was coined by Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan after Horn's six strikeout game.\n\nSammy Sosa and Ray Lankford are the only players to hit for a platinum sombrero more than twice. Only eight players have had six strikeouts, listed below. All eight players who accomplished a \"Horn\" needed extra innings to do it; the record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game is five.\n\nOn August 4, 2009, Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Evan Longoria went 2 for 6, recording a golden sombrero and 2 home runs. The second home run was a walk off home run. This feat was also accomplished by Brandon Moss of the Oakland Athletics on April 30, 2013 in a 19-inning game against the Los Angeles Angels. They are the only players to record four strikeouts and two home runs (the second a walk-off) in a single game in the live-ball era.\n\nOn May 29, 2014, in a game against the New York Mets, Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies earned his 24th career Golden Sombrero, surpassing Reggie Jackson to take the all-time MLB lead for this statistic.\n\nOn May 29, 2015 San Diego Padres catcher Derek Norris struck out swinging in his first four plate appearances, then hit a walk-off grand slam, becoming the first MLB player in the modern era to achieve a golden sombrero and a walk-off grand slam in the same game.\n\nOn July 30, 2016 New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez became the first MLB player to earn a Golden Sombrero after the age of 40 while having earned one before the age of 20. \n\nOn June 13, 2017, Chicago Cubs Second baseman Ian Happ went 1 for 5, recording a golden sombrero and a grand slam.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, Chicago Cubs infielder Javier Baez went 0 for 5, recording a platinum sombrero. On the same day, Seattle Mariners designated hitter Nelson Cruz went 0 for 6 with five strikeouts, also recording a platinum sombrero. This marked the first time in Major League history in which two players from two different games achieved platinum sombreros in the same day (although due to extra innings, Cruz's fifth strikeout technically occurred on July 26).\n\nOn October 11, 2017, Chicago Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant went 0 for 4, recording a golden sombrero, on the same day as New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge, who went 0 for 5 and recorded his own golden sombrero, his third in the ALDS and making him the only player since 1903 to accomplish this.\n\nPrior to the start of the World Series, golden sombreros in the 2017 postseason had already tied the record set in 1997. An increase in the use of starting pitchers as relievers has been suggested as a cause. \n\nOn April 3, 2018, Giancarlo Stanton recorded a platinum sombrero in his home debut in his first season for the New York Yankees, following him leading the majors in home runs and winning the National League MVP the season before. Stanton left the field after his fifth strikeout to a chorus of home field boos. Just five days later he became the first player to ever record two platinum sombreros in one season when he went 0-7 and struck out for a fifth time with two runners and the Yankees down by one to end the game in extra innings versus the Baltimore Orioles. Stanton later recorded a golden sombrero in Game 1 of the 2018 American League Division Series, his second career playoff game.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, Aaron Judge earned a platinum sombrero, but more importantly struck out eight times, over course of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers, setting a new MLB record. \n\nOn July 9, 2018, Oakland Athletics outfielder Dustin Fowler recorded a platinum sombrero. \n\nThe record for strikeouts in a single game in all of professional baseball belongs to minor league baseball player Khalil Lee of the Lexington Legends, who in 2017 struck out eight times in a twenty-one inning baseball game.\n\n"}

So now, the Great Forest Park Balloon Race is forever documented through photographs, advertisements, media, and pilot rewards.\n\nOn the day before the race, the hot air balloons participate in the Balloon Glow, a night glow opportunity for spectators to walk among inflated balloons illuminated by their burners. In addition to the Balloon Glow and a fireworks show, during the week of the event, a free public orchestral concert by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra is held on nearby Art Hill, adjacent to the Saint Louis Art Museum. During the race, the balloonists attempt to \"chase\" a 166-foot balloon of a pink bunny after taking off from the Central Fields in Forest Park. The goal is to follow the bunny until it lands, and then each pilot drops a sandbag or birdseed bag as close as possible to the bunny balloon. The winner is decided based on which pilots's sandbag, or birdseed bag, is the closest to the bunny. Due to its urban location in the city of St. Louis, the race is considered \"particularly prestigious and challenging\", and participation is by invitation only. At times, landing sites have included backyards, baseball diamonds, golf courses, street intersections, and the convent grounds of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The balloon race is accompanied by a festival that includes food and drink, inflatable castles, and a climbing wall.\n\n"}

The aim of this event is to strengthen the unity of the Eurasian steppe-nomadic horse culture and traditions between Hungarians and their cultural relatives, eastern Turkic peoples and Altaic peoples. The first Kurultaj was held in the Torgai region of Kazakhstan in 2007. The first Kurultaj in Hungary was held in 2008. These events contributed much to the revival of the Altaic self-awareness.\n\nKurultaj is a widely attended event for professional horsemen and fans of horse riding. Each Kurultaj holds the parade of horsemen, horse races, traditional horsemen wrestling, and various tournaments. Only Hungary, among European nations, has preserved the traditional kokpar game, a strategic team sport for riders.\n\n\nThe word ”kurultaj” and its variations in the Turkic languages translates as “meeting of the tribes”. It occurs amongst tribal nations and practically in all the nomadic cultures. Hungarian nomadic tribes also held these meetings, a fact that is mentioned in Byzantine and Arab written sources. At such meetings, important decisions were made, in particular, the leaders of the tribes would meet often to discuss military decisions and strategies.\n\nThe Kurultaj of 2013 took place from 9 to 11 August.\n\nThe Kurultaj of 2014 took place at Bugac in the Southern Great Plain region in Hungary.\n\nThe events of 2015 were organized by the Hungarian Turan Foundation with contributions from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TİKA) and named the year's event Ancestors Day. Representatives from the governments of Hungary and Turkey joined the festivities as well.\n\nThe Kurultáj of 2016 took place from 12 to 14 August at Bugac.\n\n\n"}

They are commonly known as \"Loucos da Saída 3\" (in English, \"Exit 3 Mads\"), because of their localization in São Januário bleachers, and \"A Barra Mais Louca\" (in English, \"The Most Mad Barra\"), because of their passion, cheering unconditionally.\n\nAfter seen a poor support from Vasco da Gama fans in Copa do Brasil finals in 2006, friends started conversations about a creation of a new supporters group unnamed yet. It was decided that group would be a barra brava, unlike the common \"torcidas organizadas\" in Brazil. \"Guerreiros do Almirante\" was the chosen name and a Orkut community was created to meet people for the barra. The first Guerreiros reunion was in August 8. In August 16, Guerreiros appeared for the first time in a stadium, in a match against São Caetano in São Januário. In August 31, in a match against Ponte Preta in São Januário, Guerreiros premiered its musical instruments and \"barras\" (vertical rags).\n\nGuerreiros are known by their songs. Since its emergence, various songs to support Vasco da Gama appeared. The most famous is \"Anna Julia Vascaína\", a version of Los Hermanos hit \"Anna Julia\".\n\nIn December 2013, a shocking struggle between Atlético Paranaense's \"Os Fanáticos\" and Vasco da Gama's \"Força Jovem\" in Joinville resulted a one-year ban for these torcidas. The absence of the main torcida organizada of Vasco da Gama caused a Guerreiros increase, getting – even it can be temporarily – a main role in São Januário and other Brazilian stadiums.\n\nGuerreiros, like another barras brava, doesn't have a system association. Even that, sub-groups are common in Guerreiros. Normally these sub-group are identified by their territorial basis, like Centro, Baixada Fluminense, Macaé, Zona Oeste, Jacarepaguá (commonly known as \"Jabacreio\"), , Méier, Niterói-São Gonçalo, Ilha do Governador, Tijuca and São Cristóvão.\n\n\n"}

These events often emphasize children's participation and may be organized by a recognized Pony Club or a 4-H club. In parts of the western United States, this type of competition is usually called an \"O-Mok-See\" (also spelled \"omoksee\" or without hyphenation as \"o mok see\") competition, a term derived from a Native American phrase said to mean \"games on horseback.\" Very small events with little or no prize money, designed for beginners or riders at a local level, are sometimes called playdays. Gymkhana is the word used in most of the rest of the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom, and both the east and west coasts of the United States.\n\nGymkhana and o-mok-see classes include timed speed events such as barrel racing, pole bending, keyhole race, keg race (also known as \"down and back\"), flag racing, and stake race. Some organizations include ride and run, musical mats, egg stomp, $1 bill race or \"ride a buck\", and sack race. \n\nMost of these events are designed to display precise, controlled actions and tight teamwork between horse and rider at speed, and demonstrate many skills such as flying lead changes, sliding stops and more. Most clubs offer a variety of classes for all ages and abilities of people, allowing riders to compete at the speed level at which they are most capable and comfortable.\n\nO-Mok-See or omoksee is the most common term used in the Western United States for events in the sport of pattern horse racing. Most events are run with contestants simultaneously running in 4 separate lanes (3 for small arenas), with each contestant riding in a 30 foot wide lane. The origin of the term \"O-Mok-See\" is thought to specifically originate with the Blackfeet people where they described a particular style of riding as \"oh-mak-see pass-kan\" meaning \"riding big dance\". This event was thought to be a war ceremony; before setting out on a mounted expedition against the enemy, the warriors of the camp performed this dance as a part of the prelude of stirring up courage and enthusiasm for battle. The warriors put on their finest dress attire, decorated and painted their best horses, carrying their war bundles, shields, lances and bonnets. They mounted and gathered at some distance out of sight of the camp. They turned and rode together at full speed into the great camp circle, circled around it once and then rode to the center of the camp. In the center were a number of old men and women who sang special songs and beat drums for the horsemen. The horsemen then rode their trained horses to the rhythm of the singers and drummers. From time to time the riders dismounted and danced about on foot beside their horses, shooting in the air and shouting to one another to be brave when the battle came. If anyone fell from his horse during the ceremony it was considered an omen of bad luck.\n\nThe National Saddle Clubs Association (NSCA) was established in January 1965 as the first national organization of saddle clubs. The NSCA held its first national championship show in 1966. The NSCA has adopted and promotes the sport of \"pattern horse racing\" under the term O-Mok-See. They encourage and allow families to compete together. The NSCA has adopted a set of pattern horse racing events for national competition . some of the events that they run are pole bending, California stake race, polo, key, international flags, Idaho figure-eight and two barrel Flags. There are also 10 or so more events in their rule book. Through standardized rules and regulations for pattern horse racing events, the NSCA's prime purpose and objectives are to promote and cultivate cooperation and friendly relationships between saddle clubs throughout the United States.\n\n\n"}

Unlike many school districts in Texas, AISD uses multiple shared stadiums including House Park for use in athletic events rather than building a stadium for each high school.\n\nOn October 31, 1938, the Public Works Administration (PWA) offered the City of Austin a grant not to exceed $613,127 to cover 45% of the costs of school buildings, a stadium and field house, and additions and alterations to existing school buildings, including necessary equipment and acquisition of necessary land under PWA Docket No. Texas-2134-F. House Park was built using a portion of this funding package. Giesecke & Harris designed the project and J. R. Blackmore & Sons built it.\n\nHouse Park opened in fall 1939 along Shoal Creek, just down the hill from the old campus of Austin High School near downtown. The stadium was built on land donated by Edward M. House, a former diplomat and adviser to Woodrow Wilson. House Park was later dedicated to the memory of the Austin High students that lost their lives serving in World War I and World War II.\n\n, the stadium still serves as the home stadium for Austin High, as well as Anderson, McCallum and Lanier High Schools. The absence of a track sets it apart from most other high school stadiums in large cities, but it does also host soccer games and has in the past been the site of the Texas High School Lacrosse Championships.\n\nHouse Park is the home of Austin Sol, Austin's professional ultimate frisbee team. Their inaugural season home opener was April 9, 2016.\n\nHouse Park is also the home of Austin Yellow Jackets of the Independent Women's Football League.\n\nIn 2008, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with artificial turf. Fans were able to take patches of the grass turf as souvenirs.\n\nOn May 25, 2015, historic flooding along Shoal Creek damaged the stadium and turf forcing the Aztex to search for a temporary home.\n\n"}

Each player has two juggling balls and a final ball is held by the server, who serves by throwing the ball into the opponent's side of the court. This must be \"caught\" by one of the opponents, by using the ball to perform a three-ball juggling pattern (commonly the three-ball cascade). They are allowed three catches before one of the balls (not necessarily the one that was served) must be thrown to another player, or passed back across the net. Like volleyball, only three passes are allowed by a team before the ball must be returned.\n\nTeams score by causing the ball to land in the opponent's side of the court, causing the opposition to throw a ball out of bounds, or fail to complete a juggling pattern. Games are relatively informal, and players are encouraged to show off their juggling skills for spectators.\n"}

Under an agreement made in 1979, 40 percent of any surplus was to stay in Southern California, with the other 60 percent going to the United States Olympic Committee. The total surplus was $232.5 million. Southern California's share was approximately $93 million.\n\nThe LA84 Foundation's mission is to promote and expand youth sports opportunities in Southern California and to increase knowledge of sport and its impact on people's lives. Since inception, the Foundation has invested more than $225 million in Southern California by awarding grants to youth sports organizations, initiating sports and coaching education programs, and operating the world's premier sports library.\n\nGrants are awarded to organizations that provide on-going, structured youth sports programs combining the essential elements of teaching, learning and competition. The Foundation makes grants in the eight southernmost counties of California (Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura). Youth organizations in the Los Angeles area receive priority. The LA84 Foundation has made grants to more than 1,100 Southern California organizations since 1985.\n\nThe LA84 Foundation has initiated programs to meet the youth sports needs of Southern California and to create models that can be applied elsewhere. These include the LA84 Foundation Coaching Education Program as well as large-scale sports programs such as Summer Swim and Run 4 Fun, which serve nearly 20,000 children and teenagers each year.\n\nThe Foundation's headquarters is the historic Eugene W. Britt House, a Registered Historic Place located at 2141 West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles' Jefferson Park neighborhood. It was formerly a sports museum that featured the Helms Athletic Foundation's collection of sports books, film, photographs and memorabilia. First Interstate Bank and the Peter and Ginny Ueberroth Foundation donated the Helms Collection, house and grounds to the LA84 Foundation in the summer of 1985.\n\nThe Paul Ziffren Sports Resource Center houses the world's premier sports library. The library maintains an extensive collection of books, periodicals, photograph and moving footage, with a special emphasis on the Olympic Games. The traditional library has been supplemented by the development of an extensive electronic collection of 100,000 PDFs including scholarly publications, popular magazine and primary historical documents available at no cost on the LA84 Foundation website.\n\nThe LA84 Foundation also hosts conferences and sponsors research on a variety of sport topics. The LA84 Foundations practical knowledge, acquired through years of direct involvement in youth sports, combined with its wide range of education services enables the Foundation to serve as a leading forum for the exchange of ideas and exploration of issues in sport.\n\nIn June 2007, the Foundation adopted the name LA84 Foundation to establish a unique identity and honor the spirit of the 1984 Olympic Games, which created the Foundation's endowment.\n\nThe swimming stadium used for the 1932 Olympic Games has been renamed the LA84 Foundation/John C.

It was first held in 1968 and continues today. Gerry Charnley, a skilled mountaineer and orienteer, designed the KIMM to test orienteering skills in extreme circumstances; the full-length KIMM course is a double-marathon length race. Each team must carry all their gear, including equipment for an overnight camp. Moreover, the course is not disclosed until the race begins, so each team must have good navigation skills. Some have called the KIMM the forerunner of modern adventure racing.\n\nFor its first 8 years, the event was known as 'The Karrimor'. In addition to the 'Elite category' double marathon, other course lengths have been added over the years to suit a greater variety of competitors (see 'Classes of competition' below). The core elements remain, however: there is always an overnight camp and the teams of two must be self-sufficient. \n\nThe KIMM name was adopted in 1976.\n\nAfter Galloway in 1976 which experienced exceptionally bad weather with only 30% completing, Gerry Charnley spoke in a TV interview with the BBC: \"Don't you think this event is too tough?\" asked the interviewer, and Charnley responded: \"Everybody knows this is the KIMM, the toughest event on the calendar and it's not a Sunday afternoon picnic.\" This attitude has remained throughout the events history and places it as one of the most challenging mountain marathons in the world.\n\nIn 1977, a special map from Harvey Maps was commissioned. \n\nIn 2004 the event became known as the OMM after Karrimor's sponsorship was withdrawn.\nThe 2008 OMM was abandoned, for the first time in the race's history, due to ill-informed media coverage which suggested that the very challenging weather conditions (100 mph winds and extremely heavy rain) placed competitors and potential rescuers in danger. Reference was made to '1,700 people unaccounted for in the hills' though in fact all of these were still competing and unaware that anyone was concerned for them; as usual a significant number of competitors were current or former Mountain Rescue Team members. In fact only one competitor needed to be rescued after being swept away in a torrent, slightly injured and stranded on an island, though there were other unconnected rescues in the Lake District at the time which were widely assumed to be connected to the OMM. Flooding did cause considerable disruption and damage at the base camps and the high winds resulted in the abandonment of some of the manned radio checkpoints; this and the genuine risk at river crossings were the principal reasons for cancelling the second day's competition.\n\nIn January 2010 the ownership of OMM, the event and the products was bought by Ark Consultants UK Ltd.\n\nIn 2013, the organisers of the Original Mountain Marathon revealed plans for a summer version of the event, along with a mountain biking marathon.\n\nOMM currently comprises seven competition classes (four line events and three score courses) which vary in length and severity, approximately as follows:\n\n\n\nOMM have also started producing their own branded outdoor clothing and equipment. Items required on the event, such as waterproof jackets and trousers, backpacks and sleeping bags, have been produced, specially adapted for the event.\nThe Kamleika (from the Aleutian word for a long waterproof robe) range of jackets, smocks and trousers have become famous amongst mountain marathon runners and hikers alike. They are unique in that they are specially developed to be stretchy and produce minimal noise when running. OMM have a larger range of clothing and equipment, also specially created for mountain marathons.\n\n1976 Swiss Orienteer Dieter Wolf brought the Karrimor International Mountain Marathon idea from England to Switzerland: 47 teams were at the start of the first Swiss Karrimor 2-day Mountain Marathon in Muothatal in 1976. Over the years several thousand lovers of the mountains, nature, orienteering and adventure sports from more than twenty countries have been able to participate in many different regions of the Swiss Alps.\n\nAfter some structural and personal changes at Karrimor ltd. in England and Salewa Sport ltd. in Switzerland a new partner had to be found for the event in 1997 so as to achieve a balanced account. Arova-Mammut, a Swiss firm manufacturing mountain sport equipment, stepped in spontaneously, so that the event had to be changed only little; under a new name its organisation would be secure for the next few years. The long cooperation with Arova-Mammut ltd. came to an end in 2002.\n\nR’adys Outdoor & Snowwear in Lachen became a new sponsor in 2004. 2013 R'adys sponsorship ended and the Event is now called SIMM (Swiss International Mountain Marathon).\n\nThis Mountain Marathon is unique in Switzerland.\n\n"}

He is a former world champion in the 100-kilometer walk.\n\nLadany survived the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944, when he was eight years old. In 1972, he survived the Munich Massacre. He is now a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben Gurion University, has authored over a dozen books and 120 scholarly papers, and reportedly speaks nine languages. He lives in Omer, Israel.\n\nAsked if it would be fair to call him the ultimate survivor, Ladany laughed and answered: \"I don't know about that. What I can say is that in my life there has never been a dull moment.\"\n\nLadany was born to a Jewish family in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He has two sisters, Shosh (two years older) and Marta (five years younger, actually his first cousin, adopted by his parents as she was six months old). He and his wife Shosh have been married for over 50 years, and have a daughter and three grandchildren who live in Modi'in.\n\nDuring the Holocaust in Europe, Ladany's maternal grandmother and grandfather were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, where, Ladany has said, they \"were made into soap.\"\n\nIn April 1941, when he was five years old, the Germans attacked Belgrade and the Luftwaffe bombed his home. His parents fled with him to Hungary. There, when he was eight years old they tried to hide him in a monastery for safekeeping, warning him to keep secret the fact that he was Jewish. He was terrified the entire time that he would be discovered, but says that after that experience he wasn't afraid of anything.\n\nIn 1944, the eight-year-old was captured by the Nazis with his parents, and shipped to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Many of his family were killed. But in December 1944, he was saved by American Jews who had paid a ransom to have a number of Jews, including him and his parents, released from the concentration camp, where 100,000 Jews had already been killed.\n\nLadany recalled:\n\nI saw my father beaten by the SS, and I lost most of my family there... A ransom deal that the Americans attempted saved 2,000 Jews and I was one. I actually went into the gas chamber, but was reprieved. God knows why.\n\nDescribing the concentration camp, Major Dick Williams, one of the first British soldiers to enter and liberate the camp, said: \"It was an evil, filthy place; a hell on Earth.\" Ladany was one of the few of Yugoslavia's 70,000 Jews who survived the Holocaust. He visits the concentration camp every time he is in Europe. He was also there for the 50th anniversary of liberation, and when a Bergen-Belsen museum was dedicated.\n\nHe was brought on the Kastner train from Bergen-Belsen to Switzerland. After the war ended, he and his family moved back to Belgrade. In December 1948, when he was 12 years old, the family emigrated to Israel, which had just become a nation state.\n\nLadany received his B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1960, and an M.Sc. from Technion in 1961. In 1964, he earned a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1968, he was awarded the Ph.D. in Business Administration by Columbia University, followed by postdoctoral research at Tel Aviv University.\n\nLadany began his competitive career as a marathon runner in Israel, when he was 18 years old. Asked whether it wasn't true that race-walking looks funny, he responded: \"But in the 1950s, when I started running, people also thought I was a nut. Jews didn't run. They would laugh.\" He explained further: \"People thought of it only as punishment for soldiers.\"\n\nIn his mid-twenties in the early 1960s, he switched to race walking. Ladany walked his first race in 1962. Commenting on the sport, he reflected:\n\nYou need a certain type of mental attitude: a willingness to take punishment, to have a lack of comfort, and pain, to continue and continue. I'm not a psychologist, but was I stubborn, so I entered race walking? Or did I enter race walking, and become stubborn? It's the same in all long-distance events. Quitters don't win, and winners don't quit.\n\nIn 1963, he won the first of his 28 Israeli national titles. In 1966, he broke the oldest U.S. track record, which had stood since 1878, in the 50-mile-walk. In April 1968, he again broke the U.S. record in the 50-mile-walk, with a time of 8:05:18 in New Jersey.\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 32, Ladany competed in his first Olympics – the 1968 Olympics – in the 50-kilometer walk (31 miles, 121 yards) in Mexico City. He finished in 24th place, with a time of 5 hours, 1 minute, and 6 seconds. He trained and competed without a coach.\n\nAt the 8th Maccabiah Games in July 1969, he won a gold medal in the 3-km walk (13.35.4). Then at the 1973 Maccabiah Games, he won the 10-km walk and the 50-km walk.\n\nIn early 1972, Ladany set a world record in the 50-mile walk in a time of 7:44:47, shattering the world mark that had stood since 1935. In April 1972, he lowered his world record to 7:23:50, in New Jersey; a world record time that still stands today. \nHe also holds the Israeli national record in the 50-kilometer walk, at 4:17:07, which he also set in 1972.\n\nIn September 1972, he returned as the sole male member of the Israeli track and field team, to compete in the 50-kilometer walk in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. He said he wanted to show the Germans that a Jew had survived, and he wore a Star of David on his warm-up jersey.\n\nWhen he was congratulated by locals on his fluent German, he responded: \"I learned it well when I spent a year at Bergen Belsen\". Asked about competing in Germany, the Holocaust survivor said: \"I don't say I have to hate Germans. Of course not the younger generation, but I have no special sympathy for the older generation who have been accused of what happened in the Nazi period.\"\n\nLadany finished his race in 19th place, with a time of 4 hours, 24 minutes, and 38 seconds. Asked how he felt, he replied: \"Arrogant because of what the Germans did to me; proud because I am a Jew\". He then returned to the athletes' Olympic Village and went to sleep.\n\nIn the early hours of September 5, 1972, the Munich Massacre began. Eight rifle-carrying Palestinian terrorists, who were members of the Black September faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, broke into the Israeli quarters in the Olympic Village to take the Israeli Olympic delegation athletes and coaches hostage. The terrorists captured wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg. They shot and killed Weinberg, and threw his body out a window onto the sidewalk.\n\nEarly in the morning somebody wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that was standing in the entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.\n\nAnother team member took Ladany to the window and pointed to the blood stains outside the apartment. They decided to leave the apartment via the rear of their apartment that backed onto a lawn, despite knowing that they would be visible to the terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists from the second floor, from apartment number one, had a clear view from the window and we moved out, walked along the lawn without running or zigzagging but in strong and confident legs. Maybe it was stupid ? But we had done so...we left the apartment through the lawn.\n\nThis is confirmed by surviving terrorist Jamal Al-Gashey who revealed that Ladany was spotted racing away from the building leading the terrorists to believe that they were too late to take any hostages in Apartment number two, though several were still inside the apartment. Ladany ran around to the building housing the U.S. team and banged on the ground floor apartment belonging to the team coaches. He awoke the American track coach Bill Bowerman, who alerted the German police. Bowerman called for the U.S. Marines to come and protect American Jewish Olympians swimmer Mark Spitz and javelin thrower Bill Schmidt. Ladany was the first person to spread the alert as to the attack, and was one of only five Israeli team members to escape. Weinberg and 10 other Israeli Olympic athletes and coaches were kidnapped and killed by the terrorists.\n\nA number of television, radio, and newspaper reports listed Ladany as one of those killed. One headline stated: \"Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time\". Ladany recalled later:\n\nThe impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends came up to me and tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.\n\nThree Black September members survived and were arrested at a Munich prison, but the West German authorities decided to release them the following month in exchange for the hostages of hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615 Two of the released Black September members were later killed, as were others who organized the Munich Massacre, by Israeli's Mossad during Operation Wrath of God.\n\nIn 1992, speaking of the massacre, Ladany said: \"It's with me all the time, and I remember every detail\". He visits the graves of his murdered teammates in Tel Aviv every year, on September 6.\n\nIn 2012, the International Olympic Committee decided to not hold a minute of silence before the start of the 2012 Olympic Games, to honor the 11 Israeli Olympians who were killed 40 years prior. Jacques Rogge, the IOC President, said it would be \"inappropriate\". Speaking of the decision, Ladany commented: \"I do not understand. I do not understand, and I do not accept it.\"\n\nLadany returned to competition two months later, against the wishes of the Israeli track and field authorities. The specialist in ultra long distance walking competed in the 1972 World Championships, in Lugano, Switzerland. He won the gold medal in the 100-km walk, in a time of 9:31:00.\n\nAt the 1973 Maccabiah Games, he won the 20-km and 50-km walks. In 1976, Ladany set the U.S. record in the 75-kilometer walk for the second year in a row. He became the first person ever to win both the American Open and American Masters (40 years and over) 75-kilometer walking championships. He repeated the feat in 1977 and 1981 (by which time the event had become a 100-km race).\n\nHe won the Israeli national walking championship 28 times from 1963–88. He won the U.S. national walking championship six times (from 1973–81; including the 75-km championships in 1974–77, and the 100-km title in 1974), won the Belgian national walking championship twice (1971 and 1972), won the national walking championship in Switzerland (1972), and won the South Africa national walking championship (1975). His personal best in the 50-kilometer walk is 4:17:06 (1972). He has continued to compete with considerable success at the masters level into his seventies. In 2006, he became the first 70-year-old to walk 100 miles in under 24 hours, setting a world record in Ohio of 21 hours, 45 minutes, 34 seconds.\n\nIn 2012, at the age of 75, he was still competing in 35 events a year, walking a minimum of 15 kilometers a day, and participating in a four-day, 300-kilometer walk from Paris to Tubize, near Brussels.\n\nOn every birthday he walks his age in kilometers, so on his birthday in 2012 he went on a 76-km walk in Israel's southern Negev desert. He estimates he has walked 6,000–7,000 miles a year, for a lifetime total of over half a million miles.\n\nIn his career, Ladany has never had a coach. Asked what he enjoys most about walking, he answers: \"Finishing\".\n\nIn his academic life, Ladany was a Lecturer of at the Tel Aviv University Graduate School of Business and, for over three decades, a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, where he was formerly Chairman of the department and is now emeritus professor. He has had visiting appointments at Columbia University, University of California, Irvine, Georgia Tech, Emory University, Rutgers University, City University of New York, Temple University, University of Cape Town, Science Center Berlin, Singapore University, and CSIRO (Melbourne).\n\nHe focuses on quality control and applied statistics. He has also authored over a dozen scholarly books and 110 scientific articles. He holds U.S. patents for eight mechanical designs.\n\nLadany is a noted philatelist and formed an important collection of telegraph stamps and associated material that was sold by Spink & Son in Lugano in 2015.\n\nIn 1997, his autobiography was published in Hebrew, entitled \"The Walk to the Olympics\".\n\nIn 2008, his autobiography was published in English, entitled \"King of the Road: The Autobiography of an Israeli Scientist and a World Record-Holding Race Walker\" (Gefen Publishing). In 2012, a biography was written about him in Italian by Andrea Schiavon, and published under the title: \"Cinque cerrchi e una stella\" – \"Shaul Ladany, da Bergen-Belsen a Monaco '72\" (ADD Editore, Torino).\n\nIn 2007, Ladany was awarded the Pierre de Coubertin Medal for outstanding service to the Olympic Movement. He was cited as a special person with \"unusual outstanding sports achievements during a span covering over four decades.\"\n\nLadany said he would set up an NIS10,000 Olympic race-walking fund, and offer NIS1,000 to any Israeli who can complete the 50-kilometer race in less than five hours.\n\nIn 2008, the Israeli Industrial Engineering Association honored Ladany with its Life Achievement award. He was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "642879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=642879", "title": "Shuffleboard", "text": "Shuffleboard\n\nShuffleboard, more precisely deck shuffleboard, and also known as floor shuffleboard, is a game in which players use cues to push weighted discs, sending them gliding down a narrow court, with the purpose of having them come to rest within a marked scoring area. As a more generic term, it refers to the family of shuffleboard-variant games as a whole.\n\nThe full history of shuffleboard is not known. Though there is some knowledge of its development, its actual origins, the place and date where it was first played, remain a mystery. Inevitably, this uncertainty gives rise to some debate, even disagreement, about which country can claim to have invented it. However there is no dispute concerning its age as a form of popular amusement, and in Europe has a history that goes back over 500 years.\n\nThe game was played and gambled over by King Henry VIII of England, who prohibited commoners from playing; evidently he did not always win, as the record of royal expenses for 1532 show a payment from the Privy Purse of GB£9, 'Paied to my lord Wylliam for that he wanne of the kinges grace at shovillaborde' (today's spelling: 'Paid to Lord William, for he won, by the king's grace, at shovelboard').\n\nIn its goals, form and equipment, shuffleboard shares various features with (and perhaps influences by or upon) many other games, including air hockey, bowls, bocce, curling, croquet, carrom and billiards. Historically, the ancient shovelboard, about which little is known, appears to have diverged into modern shuffleboard and sjoelen, and with the former leading to the development of both table shuffleboard and shove ha'penny.\n\nToday, due to its popularity on cruise ships and in retirement homes because of its low physical fitness requirements, the deck game is often associated with the elderly, though it is increasingly popular among younger generations. Its miniaturized tabletop variant is very popular in bars and pubs.\n\nIn \"deck\" or \"floor\" shuffleboard, players use a \"cue\" (\"cue-stick\"), to push their colored \"disks\", down a \"court\" (a flat floor of concrete, wood or other hard material, marked with lines denoting scoring zones), attempting to place their disks within a marked scoring area at the far end of the court. The disks themselves are of two contrasting colors (usually yellow and black), each color belonging to a player or team. The scoring diagram is divided by lines, into six scoring zones, with the following values: 10, 8, 8, 7, 7, 10-off. (See \"Court Description\" below for details.) After 8 disks (four per team, taking alternating shots) have been played from one end of the court (a \"frame\"), the final score values of disks for each player (or team) in the scoring zones is assessed: If a disk is completely within a scoring zone without touching (overlapping) any part of the border-line of the zone, it is \"good\" and that zone value is added to the correct player's score for the frame, and then to the player's total points. Both players good disks are added to their respective scores (As opposed to being subtracted to give only one player a net score for a frame.) Players (or teams of two players, one at each end) take turns going first during a game, so that the advantageous last shot of a frame (the \"hammer\") also alternates between players. The winner of the game may be the first to reach any total decided upon, or may be the higher score after playing a certain number of frames (e.g. 8, 12 or 16). There is also the 'first to 75-points' game. Ties are broken by playing extra frames (two for singles, four for doubles).\nIn shuffleboard, one tries to score, prevent the opponent from scoring, or both. \nThe basic strategy involves both offense and defense. If it is your turn to shoot first, you are automatically on the defensive, because your opponent has the last shot of the frame. If you simply put your first shot into the scoring area, your opponent will knock it off, and if you then score with your second shot, the same will happen, and so on until you have used your last shot, and your opponent will knock that off and probably score. To combat this you can use the strategy of blocking and hiding – That is your first shot will be a guard disk shot to a location so that it blocks your opponent from that part of the scoring area that you can still place a good disk. Your second shot will be the one to play into that hiding place you created with your first shot, so your opponent cannot hit you out directly.\n\nDimensions of a floor shuffleboard court can vary to suit available space, but an official shuffleboard court is 6 feet wide by 39 feet in length plus a 6-foot shooting area at each end. Typically a scoring zone is painted at each end of the court to reduce set-up time between games. Each scoring zone comprises an isosceles triangle 6 feet × 9 feet with the short edge away from the shooter. Behind the scoring zone is the \"10-off\" zone, an area 1½ feet deep. The court surface is usually a uniform dark green; lines are 1 inch wide except for the mid-shooting area. One-inch white lines form the scoring triangle and FURTHER divide the triangle into the separate scoring zones. Line width is not considered in court dimensions given here. The court is the same from each end. (A) 6 feet for Player Shooting Area; A line called the Baseline crosses the entire court and extends to the adjacent court on each side if any; (B) 10-off area – 1 1/2 feet. The sides of the 10-Off area are defined by two lines running at the same angle as the Scoring Triangle; The \"Back-7 Line\" crosses the entire court. (C) A \"center-line\" runs from the middle of the Back-7-line up the middle of the court for 6 feet. The two \"7\" score zones are located on each side of the Center-Line, for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the \"Back-8\" line, running side to side across and within the scoring triangle; (D) The two \"8\" scoring zones are located one each side of the center-line for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the \"Top-8\" line running side to side across and within the scoring triangle, and forming a \"T\" with the end of the center-line. (E) The \"10\" scoring zone is at the peak of the overall scoring triangle, and is 3 feet in height, from the Top-8 line to the peak of the triangle. A further \"dead-line\" or \"lag-Line\" runs from side to side 12 feet from the base-line (The dead-line is therefore 3 feet from the tip of the triangle). There are two dead-lines, 12 feet apart. Any shot disk that does not cross or touch the furthest dead-line is then simply removed from the court (a wasted shot).\n\nDisks: Modern floor shuffleboard is played with 8 round, hard, durable 6 inch diameter plastic disks – New disks are about 1\" in thickness, weighing 15 ounces. There should be four (4) discs of a light color, usually yellow, and four of a dark color, usually black. These eight (8) discs comprise a set. (Other colored combinations may be used, but \"black\" and \"yellow\" will be used here.) One player or team uses the yellow disks, the other player or team, the black disks.\nCue-Sticks: Each player uses a \"cue\" (\"cue-stick\") to push their disks down the court to the opposite end. The cue length is six feet, three inches (6'3\") or less, with hard plastic feet on the end (metal would damage the court surface).\nScoreboard: There are two basic types (1) – \"Resort Type\" uses two sliders that can move up and down a numbered scale, like a thermometer, with values running from zero at the bottom to 75 at the top (First to 75 points is a common shuffleboard game). Each team used their own slider to record their total score. The advantages of the Resort-type include simplicity, durable and weather proof, needs no other items such as chalk or eraser. The disadvantage is that scoring mistakes are impossible to determine, and a frames played cannot be tracked unless a separate recording method (e.g. pen and paper) is used.(2)- Blackboard (Whiteboard) Type is ruled with four or eight horizontal lines and each teams total score is written after each frame, yellow on the left and black on the right. When all the lines have been filled with scores the top lines are erased and scores are again written from the top. The advantage of the blackboard type is that mistakes in adding and recording the score are easier to spot, because previous scores should always be seen. As well, it is easy to keep track of frames played using small numbers written down the scoreboard. (Note that in western USA and western Canada, scoreboards (blackboards) run from side-to-side, but the principal is the same.)\n\nCourts are available for use on residential decks or on any solid flat surface, in the form of roll-out plastic mats, or adjustable arrays of plastic tiles. With the tile courts, the dimensions can be adapted to the space available; e.g. it is possible to play on a court by . The roll-out mats are available in two sizes, and . The smaller mats are designed to fit on a domestic patio or driveway. The biscuit and tang are the same standard size, regardless which court size is used.\n\nThe ISA was founded March 10, 1979, in St. Petersburg, Florida. The ISA was designed to make shuffleboard more popular in countries outside the North American continent, and to foster shuffleboard through international competitions. In 1981 in Muskegon, Michigan the first ISA Team World Championships were held, starting with teams from Canada, the USA and Japan only. Australia (1991), Brazil (1997), Germany (2006), Norway (2011) and lately Russia (2013) joined the World Championships, which take place yearly and last for one week.\n\nIn addition to the ISA, Declan hosts an international competition biannually.\n\nIn table shuffleboard, the play area is most commonly a wooden or laminated surface covered with silicone beads (colloquially called 'shuffleboard wax') to reduce friction. In the United States, a long, narrow 22 ft table is most commonly used, though tables as short as 9 ft are known.\n\nPlayers try to slide metal-and-plastic pucks, sometimes called weights or shuckles, to come to rest within zones at the other end of the board. Cues are not used, the pucks being propelled with the hands directly on the raised table. There are scoring zones at each end of the table so that direction of play can rotate after each frame, or so that teams can play both directions during one frame. More points are awarded for weights scoring closer to the far edge of the board. Players take turns sliding the pucks, trying to score points, bump opposing pucks off the board, and/or protect their own pucks from bump-offs. The long sides of the table are bounded by gutters into which pucks can fall or be knocked (in which case they are no longer in play for the remainder of the frame). A variant known sometimes as bankboard has rubber cushions or 'banks' running the length of both sides of the table, instead of gutters, and as in billiards, the banks can be used to gain favorable position. A common and even smaller-scale British tabletop variant is shove ha'penny, played with coins, while a somewhat larger wooden-puck variant called \"sjoelen\", which has much in common with the ball games bagatelle and skeeball, is played principally in the Netherlands.\n\nThe objective of the game is to slide, by hand, all four of one's Weights alternately against those of an opponent, so that they reach the highest scoring area without falling off the end of the board into the alley. Furthermore, a player's Weight(s) must be farther down the board than his opponent's Weight(s), in order to be in scoring position. This may be achieved either by knocking off the opponent's Weight(s), or by outdistancing them. Horse collar, the most common form of the game, is played to either 15 or, more typically, 21. Only the weights in front score.\n\n\n"}

It is available in powder, paste, and aerosol spray forms. According to the company website, the spray form is \"excellent for bat handles and vaulting poles.\" Many vendors also promote the product for use by weightlifters, and for various other athletic applications.\n\nStickum, along with other adhesive or \"sticky\" substances (such as glue, rosin (tree sap), or food substances), were used for years in the National Football League to assist players in gripping the ball. The use of adhesives such as Stickum was banned by the league in 1981, and the resulting action became known as the \"Lester Hayes rule\" in association with the Oakland Raiders defensive back known for his widespread use of Stickum. Despite the ban, Hall of Famer Jerry Rice freely admitted to illegally using Stickum throughout his career, leading many fans to question the integrity of his receiving records. Rice's claim that \"all players\" in his era used Stickum was quickly denied by Hall of Fame contemporaries Cris Carter and Michael Irvin.\n\nIn 2016 the National Basketball Association (NBA) also saw its players use Stickum; Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard was caught using Stickum in a game against the Atlanta Hawks. Howard later admitted that he had been using the substance for years, but neither he nor the Rockets were reprimanded by the league, though they received a warning by the NBA to avoid using the substance again.\n\n"}
{"id": "18037624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18037624", "title": "Switch hit", "text": "Switch hit\n\nA switch hit is a modern cricket shot. A switch hit involves effectively changed from a right-hander to a left-hander just before the ball was delivered by the bowler for the purpose of executing the shot. It is a variation of the reverse sweep, in which the stance is changed during the bowler's delivery action, and has been compared to switch-hitting in baseball.\n\nThe shot is usually attributed to Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen played the shot for the first time off Muttiah Muralitharan in a test match against Sri Lanka in May 2006, and used it again on 15 June 2008 in a one-day international against New Zealand. Despite the shot becoming known due to Pietersen's successful execution of it, it is believed that Jonty Rhodes actually executed this shot first: he hit a switch-hit six off Darren Lehmann in a one day international between Australia and South Africa on March 27, 2002. Australia's David Warner is a notable user of this shot and was endorsed to use a double-faced bat in Twenty20 cricket.\n\nThe shot was innovated by Pietersen using which he hit 2 sixes in the cover region. The shot is executed by changing stance from a right-handed to a left-handed batsman or vice versa during the bowler's run-up and hitting it in the cover (midwicket to a left-hander) region.\n\nThe shot has generated debate in the cricket world, some heralding it as an outstanding display of skill and others arguing that if the batsman changes stance he gains an unfair advantage over the bowler, because the field is set based on the batsman's initial stance at the crease. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), guardians of the laws of cricket, has confirmed it will not legislate against the switch shot and cited that the shot was perfectly legal in accordance with cricketing laws. The MCC believes that the stroke is exciting for the game of cricket, and highlighted Law 36.3 which defines the off side of the striker's wicket as being determined by his stance at the moment the bowler starts his run-up. The MCC has also acknowledged that the switch hit has implications on the interpretation of the 'on side' and 'off side' for the purposes of adjudicating on wides or leg before wicket decisions.\n\nIn June 2012, the International Cricket Council (ICC) committee declared it to be a legitimate shot. They issued a statement saying they have decided to make no change to the current regulations.\n\nOn the other hand, if defined by baseball equivalent, where a player change stance before even facing the ball, players that are able to bat both left handed and right handed straight up do not actually change handedness in the course of a match.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13582524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13582524", "title": "Terrace (stadium)", "text": "Terrace (stadium)\n\nA terrace or terracing in sporting terms refers to the traditional standing area of a sports stadium, particularly in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. A terrace is a series of concrete steps which are erected for spectators to stand on.\n\nIts significance carries particular importance in football where terraces were located in the areas behind the two goals as a cheaper alternative to sitting in the stands, which were traditionally located at the sides of the field. Naturally standing in the terraces was much cheaper than a seat, with the result that over the decades they became the most popular spectators' area for younger working class men and teenage boys to watch the game.\n\nDue to safety concerns related to terraces, they have fallen out of favour in many places. Terraces were banned from major football grounds in England in the early 1990s, as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, and are currently not used during major tournaments, and for a long time were generally not included in new stadium designs. There is currently a growing demand for a reintroduction of terracing, based on the modern stadium designs in Germany and other European countries, dubbed \"safe standing\" areas.\n\nIn Ireland, terraces are still a common feature in gaelic football, hurling, camogie, rugby union, soccer and other sports. Terraces in Ireland were generally not subject to the same level of violence as those in the United Kingdom, nor were they subject to crowd segregation (with the exception of, occasionally, football) or the Taylor Report as British terraces were, so terraces remained a common feature in Irish stadia. Hill 16 in Croke Park is one of the most notable terraces in Ireland.\n\nTerraces have been built or refurbished in ground improvements at many stadia in recent years, including Thomond Park, Croke Park and Flancare Park (since converted to all-seater); although all new League of Ireland stands built since Flancare's redevelopment have happened to be all-seater. Also GAA stadiums have terracing including Fitzgerald Stadium and Pearse Park\n\nIn the early days of the twentieth century the terraces were simply earth banks, often built up with the rubble of construction sites. Rows of railways sleepers were laid on top to provide something solid for spectators to stand on.\n\nMost stadiums in Britain at the turn of the century had bleachers for spectators, but when a wooden bleacher style terrace at Ibrox Park collapsed in the 1902 Ibrox disaster killing many spectators during a Scotland versus England game there was an instant ban on framework supported terraces, which the government ordered must be replaced by solid earthwork supported terracing.\n\nThe earth and sleeper terraces would gradually make way for concrete terraces with metal crush barriers being erected at various points to prevent crushing. An excellent example of one such old style terrace can be found at Cathkin Park in Glasgow, an abandoned football stadium, which was home to Third Lanark.\n\nThe terraces were hugely popular in England, particularly from the 1920s to the 1980s, and their working class links led them to be given affectionate names by the fans who stood on them. By far the most common name was \"Spion Kop\", named after the Battle of Spion Kop in the Boer War in South Africa in 1902 between Britain and the Boers. Arsenal F.C. were the first to adopt such a name but by far the most famous was the Kop at Liverpool F.C.'s Anfield Road ground. The vast majority of clubs in England and farther afield would go on to regard their most popular end of their stadium as a Kop, even if, in most cases the end had another name, for example the Holte End at Aston Villa F.C.'s Villa Park. The most notable exception to this is Everton F.C., whose close rivalry with city neighbours Liverpool has meant that neither the club nor its fans would ever refer to the ground as having a Kop section.\n\nThe advantage of terracing over seating for clubs was obvious, as many more fans could be packed in tightly into very cramped areas, and it is no coincidence that many clubs' all-time attendance records were set in the 1930s and 40s.\n\nTerraces were generally a safe, cheap and enjoyable way to watch sport, but on occasion they could be dangerous too.\n\nIn the early days the wet railway sleepers would often lead to falls, which quickly led to their replacement but much worse was to follow when thirty-three people lost their lives in 1946 when an overcrowded terrace led to a crush at Bolton Wanderers F.C.'s Burnden Park ground. That such a disaster only occurred once during this era is amazing as it was common in those days to see a fainted fan being passed down the terraces over the heads of those packed in so they could be treated for their ill effects. But there were perhaps more advantages than disadvantages still. The ground fee was low and achievable for all, the singing and cheering was not rarely astonishing, especially where the huge covered \"Goal Stands\" existed. Like the Kop at Anfield Road, Holte End at Villa Park and North Bank Stand at Molineux Ground\n\nBy the 1970s the lower cost of travel meant it was easier for fans to have away days, or road trips and a common practice among young visiting fans was to try to \"take the terrace\". Large bodies of supporters of the visiting team would infiltrate the popular terracing of the home supporters with the result that violence often erupted. This led to crowd segregation at football grounds and also played a small part in the erection of high fencing and segregated pens within most terraces in England.\n\nThese pens became a contributing factor in the Hillsborough disaster, England's worst ever stadium disaster, when too many fans entered the central pens at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death against the perimeter fence in the resultant crush.\n\nAlthough claiming that terraces were not \"intrinsically unsafe\", the final Taylor Report into the disaster led to a recommendation that terraces be done away with at major British stadiums. Today every major British football ground is all-seater, though terracing is still found at grounds in the lower leagues. Britain's biggest remaining terraced ground is Brunton Park in Carlisle, which still has three sides of terracing.\n\nIt has been argued that terraces encourage crowd disorder. However, analysis of statistics on football related arrests and banning orders published by the UK Home Office show that in both the 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons the rate of arrest per 100,000 supporters was higher at Football League One and Football League Two clubs with all-seated grounds than at those with terraces. Overall arrest rates for football related offences have fallen steadily from 34 per 100,000 in 1988/89 to 9 per 100,000 in 2009/10, however the trend of reducing arrests started before stadia were required to become all-seated and has continued since.\n\nIn 2011 the Scottish Premier League announced that their clubs would be given permission to introduce safe standing areas at their grounds. In 2012, Aston Villa announced they would be looking to install safe standing areas in Villa Park in time for the 2013–14 season. In that same year, Derby County became the first club from the Championship to support the introduction of safe standing areas, although the only terraced standing areas in the Championship and/or Barclays Premiership at that time could be found at London Road, home to Peterborough United. Peterborough United became the second Championship club to back the safe standing campaign through their CEO Bob Symns. Symns also signed the safe standing petition. Indeed, the club's mascot – Peter Burrow – took part in a video campaign promoting safe standing, with the video being shot at the AWD-Arena, home to Hannover 96 in Germany\n\nTerracing was introduced to American football with the inclusion of party decks with the ability to hold 35,000 people at Cowboys Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Texas. Capacity for Dallas Cowboys games and other American football events is 80,000 seated, expandable to 111,000 with standing areas. However, it should be noted that these decks are flat, rather than steeply pitched, and are more analogous to standing-room only ticketing where obstruction is expected. The key difference is that unlike at European grounds, party decks are not considered or marketed as areas from which all spectators are afforded a view of the match at all times.\n\nMany seats in FedExField, home of the Washington Redskins, have been removed in favor of terraced party decks. These terraced, standing room only sections are similar to safe standing sections in European stadiums, though they are not marketed as such.\n\n"}
{"id": "5051251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5051251", "title": "Walkover", "text": "Walkover\n\nA walkover, also W.O. or w/o (originally two words: \"walk over\") is the awarding of a victory to a contestant because there are no other contestants or the other contestants have been disqualified or have forfeited. The term can apply in sport but also to elections, when it is also referred to as winning \"by default\". The word is used more generally by extension, particularly in politics, for a contest in which the winner is not the only participant but has little or no competition. The narrow and extended meanings of \"walkover\" as a single word are both found from 1829.\n\nThe word originates from horseracing in the United Kingdom, where an entrant in a one-horse race run under Jockey Club rules has at least to \"walk over\" the course before being awarded victory. This outcome was quite common at a time when there was no guaranteed prize money for horses finishing second or third, so there was no incentive to run a horse in a race it could not win. The eighteenth century champion racehorse Eclipse was so dominant over his contemporaries that he was allowed to walk over on nine occasions, and the 1828 Epsom Derby winner Cadland walked over on at least six occasions.\n\nThe term is also used in tennis, in reference to a player's unopposed victory as a result of the opponent's failing to start the match for any reason, such as injury.\n\nThe only Olympic Games walkover for a gold medal was at the 1908 Summer Olympics: Wyndham Halswelle won a rerun of the 400 m race as the two other athletes refused to take part in the rerun. The only time it has happened at the FIFA World Cup was in the 1938 edition, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany before the former was scheduled to play Sweden. After the England team declined to take Austria's entry, FIFA gave Sweden a walkover.\n\nA walkover is usually the sign of a very strong mandate or unanimous support. It can, however, be interpreted by critics of the faction the walkover is awarded to as a suspicious sign of electoral fraud or gerrymandering to prevent other candidates from participating. The circumstances of such an interpretation are usually controversial. Walkovers can thus often be a sign of an illiberal democracy.\n\nIn civic organisations and civic societies, where personal charisma and personal politics often dominate, while parties or factions are often interested in a seat, they may not contest a seat that is being held by a long-standing or very popular individual, for fear of being seen as \"rocking the boat\". In elections for these societies, there is often \"pre-election politics\" where candidates attempt to figure out who is running for which positions; in this cat and mouse game, elected positions are thus often effectively decided by internal politics before a single vote is cast.\n\nMany liberal democracies in history, including the United States, have had uncontested elections because support for one candidate was so strong. In the United States presidential elections of 1789 and 1792, George Washington ran uncontested for President, although in the latter election the ballot for the Vice President was contested by both Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. In the 1820 election, James Monroe also ran unopposed, though\nNew Hampshire elector William Plumer cast a vote for John Quincy Adams as a symbolic measure.\n\nElection walkovers are called acclamation in Canada.\n\nOther multi-party systems that have held uncontested presidential elections include Germany, Singapore, Ireland, Algeria, Iceland, and Zimbabwe.\n\nRunning without opponents is not always a guarantee of winning. Many elections require that the winner has not only the most votes of all candidates but a defined fraction of all votes cast, or of the electorate. In this case electors may be able to cast a blank vote or none of the above vote, spoil their papers, or abstain from voting, preventing the one candidate from winning and forcing a new election. In the Philippines, the sole candidate in an uncontested election must have at least one vote in order to win the seat; this is also true in general elections in the United States, and there are cases in local government races where the sole candidate on the ballot finished with zero votes (as almost all U.S. government seats require candidates to reside in the municipality they seek to represent, this means the candidate themselves must, usually out of forgetfulness or lack of time on election day, fail to vote for themselves) and thus lose an uncontested election. In such cases, the other members of the body usually appoint someone to the vacant seat. (This is not true in primary elections.) In theory, if a candidate is unopposed on the ballot but lacks support of their constituency, a draft campaign could outvote the unopposed candidate with any write-in candidate, regardless of whether that write-in name is actively seeking the seat.\n\n”Winning by default” can also happen when there are less candidates than what is required. For example, if a group requires 7 people, and only 4 people go for the role, the candidates may be elected by default.\n\nIn poker games that use blinds, a hand is considered a walkover (usually shortened to \"walk\") when no other players call or raise the big blind, resulting in the player who posted the big blind winning the hand by default. Walks are most often seen in tournament play. Cash games often allow the players to \"split the blinds\" (i.e. take back their blind bets in case there are no callers or raisers by the time the action gets to the small blind), but this is usually not permitted in tournaments.\n"}

His works include \"The Strategy of Social Protest\", \"WHAT'S NEWS\" (1984), and \"Talking Politics\" (2002), as well as numerous editions of \"SimSoc\".\n\nGamson, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1959, was the 85th president of the American Sociological Association in 1994. He is also a 1978 recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1962, he won the AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research.\n\nGamson was instrumental in the creation of fantasy baseball and fantasy sports. He created one of the first fantasy baseball leagues in Boston in 1960, the \"Baseball Seminar,\" where colleagues would form rosters that earned points on the players' final standings in batting average, RBI, ERA and wins. Gamson later brought the idea with him to the University of Michigan where some professors played the game. One professor playing the game was Bob Sklar, who taught an American Studies seminar which included Daniel Okrent, who learned of the game his professor played. Okrent would later write a book that was the key catalyst for the modern fantasy sports industry.\n\n\"Gamson's Law of Proportionality\" or simply \"Gamson's Law\" was suggested by Eric C. Browne and Mark N. Franklin in 1971. They stated that there is proportionality between the numerical representation of each political force in a government and their number of seats in the parliament. It was based on the idea that each actor in government expects a payoff proportional to the weight that it contributes to the coalition, that had been proposed in the paper \"A theory of coalition formation\", published in 1961 by William Gamson.\n\n\n"}

The ball was usually made of possum fur, and was played in a group of four to six players in circle. It was a co-operative kicking game to see for how long the ball can be kept in the air before it touches the ground.\n\n'Woggabaliri' was documented prior to 1904 as the Ngunnawal word for \"play\". Played by the Wiradjuri and surrounding peoples before European arrival, Woggabaliri is a non-competitive game played with a ball made of Bulrush roots wrapped in possum fur where the objective of it is to keep the ball in the air using association football type skills of teamwork and ball control. Author Ken Edwards notes that a similar game with a ball made of grass covered in beeswax was also played by the Jingili people of the Northern Territory. \n\nWoggabaliri is recognised by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) as one of the oldest Indigenous ball games and is the earliest depicted, believed by the ASC to be the subject of an engraving \"never let the ball hit the ground\" based on William Blandowski's observations in 1857 of camp life near Merbein, Victoria. The image is inscribed:A group of children is playing with a ball. The ball is made out of typha roots (roots of the bulrush). It is not thrown or hit with a bat, but is kicked up in the air with a foot. The aim of the game – never let the ball touch the ground.\n\nIn 2010, Football Federation Australia referenced Woggabaliri in its Australian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid citing its similarity to football (soccer) as part of Australia's national heritage.\n\nIn Australia the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation promotes Woggabaliri as one of several Indigenous games available as an addition to traditional school sports. The New South Wales Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation promotes Woggabaliri in New South Wales schools. Woggabaliri was also included as an activity in Teacherwebs 2010 summer camp schedule in the United States.\n\nThe game is played by groups of four to six players standing in a circle 2 metres apart and uses either an association football or a volleyball ball. Using feet and knees only, in no set order but without consecutive touches, the players attempt to keep the ball from touching the ground. The group that has the most touches in a set time wins. If the ball touches the ground the count is restarted. \n\nTwo teams of four play on a volleyball court sized pitch with football (soccer) goals at each end. A game consists of two halves lasting 10 minutes each. Players may use feet, knees, thighs, chest and head to keep the ball aloft with the team losing possession if the ball touches the ground, is intercepted or an infringement occurs. Tackling is not permitted, and goals can be scored from any part of the pitch.\n\n"}
