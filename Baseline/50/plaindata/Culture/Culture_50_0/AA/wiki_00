Advanced Skills Teachers are judged through external assessment against a range of criteria to demonstrate excellent classroom teaching practice. They are employed in Advanced Skills Teacher posts in roles which include an element of work dedicated to supporting teaching colleagues in their own schools, and other schools in the area, to improve their own practice. The role was introduced in 1998 to reward excellent teachers who chose to stay working in classrooms, rather than following other routes to promotion through leadership.\n\nThe Labour party manifesto for the general election of 1997 included a statement that they would \"create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best.\" The intention was to ensure that teachers who excelled in the classroom were given both financial incentive and career-path options to allow them to continue in that role, providing a role model of high quality teaching.\n\nFollowing its election in May of that year, the new government brought forward the white paper, \"Excellence in Schools\", which outlined proposals for the new grade of teacher. The then Secretary of State for Education and Employment, David Blunkett, released additional details about the nature and pay relating to the posts in March 2008. In July of that year, regulations were put in place to provide funding for the role, with the grade being formally introduced from September 1998.\n\nAdvanced Skills Teachers (ASTs) are given additional non-teaching time to allow them to share their teaching skills with colleagues both within their own school, and in other schools in the local area. This time normally amounts to a minimum 20% of the working week. In this time, ASTs are expected to undertake a range of tasks related to the raising of standards of teaching and learning in classrooms. These include, although are not limited to:\nIt is expected that a considerable amount of this work will be undertaken in schools other than the teacher's own school as part of outreach schemes. This may involve working in liaison with the Local Education Authority.\n\nTo become an Advanced Skills Teacher, a qualified teacher must first be assessed as meeting the professional standards of the role. In addition, they must be appointed to a specially-created Advanced Skills Teacher post.\n\nIn order to be assessed as an AST, a teacher must demonstrate that they are able to meet the professional standards for the role. There are three stated standards relating to the role of AST, but in addition, applicants must also meet the subsumed standards of an Excellent teacher - a separate role as defined by government policy. There are a total of 28 standards to be met, falling under three main categories:\n\nTeachers applying for AST posts must meet an external assessor who will judge the postholder against the criteria before being appointed to the post.\n\nWhen the role of AST was first introduced, it was accompanied by a 27-point pay scale separate from that of classroom teachers or school managers. In its review of school teachers' pay in 2004, the School Teachers' Review Body recommended a change to the scale with effect from September 2006. Since that time, Advanced Skills Teachers have been paid on a scale of 18 pay points, which is identical to the first 18 points range of the Leadership pay scale, which is used for Head teachers, and Deputy and Assistant Headteachers.\n\nUnlike teachers employed on the main pay scale, Advanced Skills Teachers are not subject to the limits on working time of 195 days per academic year, or 1265 directed hours per year. Head teachers are, however, required to ensure that Advanced Skills Teachers have a reasonable work/life balance.\n\n"}

{"id": "32235697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32235697", "title": "American fiddle", "text": "American fiddle\n\nAmerican fiddle-playing began with the early settlers who found that the small \"viol\" family instruments were portable and rugged. According to Ron Yule, \"John Utie, a 1620 immigrant, settled in the North and is credited as being the first known fiddler on American soil\". Early influences were Irish fiddle styles as well as Scottish and the more refined traditions of classical violin playing. Popular tunes included \"Soldier's Joy\", for which Robert Burns had written lyrics, and other such tunes as \"Flowers of Edinburgh\" and \"Tamlin,\" which were claimed by both Scottish and Irish lineages.\n\nSoon these tunes were Americanized; local variations developed in the Northern and Southern colonies. In contemporary American fiddle styles, the New England states are heavily influenced by all Celtic styles, including Cape Breton fiddle-playing; whereas Southern or \"Dixie\" fiddle styles have tended to develop their own traditions, which emphasize double stops and in some instances the incorporation of dance calls or simple lyrics.\n\nIn a radical departure from tradition, groups such as Trio Chipontepec are cropping up at American fiddle festivals. Rock is fusing with country, jazz with rock, and classical violinists are retooling in an era characterized by home recording studios and the easy availability of new media such as MP3 downloads.\n\nSome folk fiddlers distinguish \"fiddle\" from \"violin\", though this is far from universal - many classical violinists refer to their \"fiddle\". Nevertheless, a few common differences may be observed;\n\nGenerally, the setup of the instruments is different:\n\n\nFiddle playing generally avoids vibrato except for occasional slow tempo pieces and even then uses less vibrato. Shorter bow strokes are also consistent with the fiddle players' tendency to use less legato and more detache bow strokes. Some, but not all, styles use double stops and open tunings. Trick fiddling is employed, often built upon cross bowing technique such as used in Orange Blossom Special or Beaumont Rag.\nBowing by fiddle players is quite different in that they may intentionally grip the frog in a crude manner and typically choke up on the bow. See for instance Rhiannon Giddens of the Carolina Chocolate Drops Massachusetts performance of \"Genuine Negro Jig\" in May 2010.\n\nFiddle players tend to play fiddle \"tunes\" rather than sonatas and other classical types of compositions. There are exceptions. For instance, partitas have been popular with fiddle players, particularly since publication of the Open House CD by Kevin Burke, an Irish style player based in Portland, Oregon. Fiddles are typically associated with country and other genres of popular music while violins are usually associated with classical and other genres of art music.\n\n\nAlso known as \"OBS\", Orange Blossom Special exploits the capacity of fiddle or violin to imitate various mechanical tones. Authorship is controversial.\n\nThe canonical American fiddle tune, \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" was written by Charlie Daniels as an interpretation the \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" by Vassar Clements and has been covered innumerable times. Although classified as country rock, the tune uses licks based on old-time fiddle playing and rock guitar riffs. Unlike most old-time playing, the instrument ranges high up the neck, exploiting both the legendary association of the fiddle as \"the devil's instrument\" and the intensity of rapid sixteenth or thirty-second notes. These effects are achieved through rapid detache bowing bordering on outright tremolo. The motif of a deal with the Devil may have been influenced by Cross Road Blues, by Delta blues singer Robert Johnson.\n\nAccording to London-based music writer Chris Haigh, fiddle \" was among the primary instruments used by the rural blacks...\" He contends that by 1930 over 50 different black blues fiddle players had recordings. Many musicians who were guitar stars also played fiddle including:\n\n\nBlues fiddle uses the pentatonic blues scale to create riffs for breaks and over guitar chords typically in the standard blues progression. Vibrato is not often used, although may occasionally be used in an exaggerated manner for special effect.\n\nViolin, Sing The Blues For Me\n\nAfrican-American Fiddlers 1926-1949\nOld Hat CD-1002\n\nOld time fiddle uses a profusion of double stops and authentic players typically tune their instruments in \"open tunings\" or cross tunings. The set ups often include flattened bridges and in some cases no chin rest. The most popular tuning ia AEAE for the key of A, but the instrument can be down tuned to GDGD, which may put less tension on the neck when playing solo. ADAE is also popular for the key of D, and standard (GDAE) is often used for G. Some of the earliest popular repertoire includes \"Turkey in the Straw,\" \"Arkansas Traveler,\" \"Billy in the Lowground.\" Accompanying instruments include washboard, jug bass, banjo, dulcimer, guitar, and occasionally kazoo.\n\nAccording to some sources, old time music is actually the \"early recorded country music of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly of the southeastern states\" thus narrowing the definition considerably. Nevertheless, a broader definition usually prevails which incorporates unrecorded music with roots long before radio transmission and sound recording were invented. Within old time music there are regional subgenres, such as the Deep South and Appalachia, where fiddle music is often intertwined with cultural phenomena such as coal mining.\n\nA comprehensive review of old time fiddle styles was written by David Reiner and Peter Anick and published in 1989.\n\nBluegrass music originated in the person of Bill Monroe. According to Haigh, \"Monroe always considered the fiddle to be the key instrument of bluegrass\".\n\n\nAccording to Ron Yule, \"Louisiana fiddling had its birth roots in Europe, with fiddling being noted as early as the 15th century in Scotland.\" The most widely known Cajun fiddler is Doug Kershaw.\n\nZydeco music is closely related.\n\nRock fiddle, like rock music in general, owes much to American blues. Incorporation of fiddle or violin into rock, as with jazz, has been a slow process, resisted by some critics as an\"unlikeliest and perverse misuse of an instrument\". Rock has roots in folk music particularly the American folk revival of the 1960s, and thus as a matter of usage some writers refer to \"rock fiddle\" when discussing playing by classically trained musicians who join rock bands and thus import classical style rather than fiddle style into their playing.\n\n\nRock violinists often use solid body electric violins to reduce feedback. Rock is an international phenomenon and is consequently influenced by cross fertilizations from rock players such as Ashley MacIsaac Nevertheless, American rockers continue to experiment. For instance, eclectic rocker Natalie Stovall, a graduate of Berkelee Conservatory, covers Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Michael Jackson, Lenny Kravitz, The White Stripes, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jimi Hendrix, all the while alternating between standard rock vocals and fiddle/violin riffs.\n\nOther rock fiddle or violin players include\n\n\nJazz playing on the fiddle is often called jazz violin but there are some instances in which \"jazz fiddle\" is discussed. For instance Mel Bay contributor Martin Norgard presents jazz fiddle in numerous media (book, website). Nevertheless, instructional jazz playing was preceded by the highly influential 1992 Oak Publications volume Jazz Violin\" by Matt Glaser and Stephane Grapelli. The topic is indeed covered on the Wikipedia online encyclopedia at the article page entitled Jazz violin. Australian jazz player Ian Cooper is presented as a violinist. Dutch eclectic player Tim Kliphuis presents his jazz instructional material as \"Jazz Swing Violin Fiddle\" but his website quotes the Glasgow Herald review which denominates hims as a \"splendid young...violinist\".\n\nThis music, usually considered to be synonymous with Western swing, is \"bona fide\" fiddle music and is deeply intertwined with country and folk music as played by Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Vince Gill, Dale Watson, the Wheel's Jason Roberts, Jesse Dayton, and Garrison Keillor. A well-known example of this music is \"Faded Love\", which despite some controversy is generally attributed to Bob Wills.:*Mark O'Connor is a legendary performer who also plays bluegrass and jazz but got started as a youth contender in fiddle contests.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of the New England fiddle tradition was Maine's Mellie Dunham, who was a sensation in his day. Today New England fiddle playing is exemplified by Rounder Records artist Frank Ferrel. He refers to the style as \"Down East\" in his volume \"Boston Fiddle\". Unlike other fiddle traditions, piano accompaniment is common, and, he notes occasionally saxophone or clarinet would join in. Another feature is frequent use of minor keys particularly G minor and also the \"flat keys\" of F Major and B flat Major, which are not typically used in Old Time and other indigenous music traditions. Ferrell traces his roots into the 1800s Boston Scottish and Irish cultures as typified in musicians such as William Bradbury Ryan. Like all Celtic American fiddle traditions, his is influenced by the publication of Chief O'Neil's massive directory of fiddle tunes in 1903 Thus, Ferrel and others in the North East tradition use the full panoply of Irish fiddle ornamentation.\n\nOther influences include Scottish fiddling and Cape Breton style, which has its own blend of Celtic traditions which include also Normandy styles.\n\nAmerican fiddle traditions are deeply influenced by international influence from numerous immigrations and ordinary commerce particularly from Anglo-Celtic and Canadian sources. Québécois French, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. \nSome observers categorize Maritime influence as a cosmopolitan trend of its own blending otherwise distinct styles \nwhich outlines several influences on what they call Northeastern Fiddling Styles: Cape Breton, French-Canadian (Québécois) and Maritime.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film is a feature-length adaptation of his 2012 Oscar-winning short film, \"Curfew\". The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest Film on March 10, 2014. The film was acquired for distribution by IFC Films on August 5, 2014 and released on November 28, 2014.\n\nIn New York City, Richie (Shawn Christensen), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill (Ron Perlman), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.\n\nAt his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie (Emmy Rossum), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia (Fátima Ptacek). Richie goes to her school, where she recites \"Because I could not stop for Death\" by Emily Dickinson in both English and Mandarin Chinese. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.\n\nRichie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for menopause. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.\n\nRichie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon (Paul Wesley), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.\n\nAs a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham (Richard Schiff), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.\n\nRichie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called \"Sophia\". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.\n\nAfter Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren (Fran Kranz), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.\n\nHaving reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.\n\nMaggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a \"false idol\". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.\n\n\n\"Before I Disappear\" had its worldwide premiere at South by Southwest (SXSW) on March 11, 2014, where it won the Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Award.

Séverine Merle is the Chief Executive Officer since April 2017.\n\nOn January 21, 2018, LVMH announced that Hedi Slimane will take over at Celine as its artistic, creative and image director.\n\nIn 1945, Céline Vipiana (1915–1997) and her husband, Richard, created one of the first luxury brands in the industry, Céline, a made-to-measure children's shoe business, and opened a first boutique at 52 rue Malte in Paris. The brand was recognised by its logo, the red elephant created by Raymont Peynet.\n\nIn 1960, the brand decided to change its positioning by focusing its business on a ready-to-wear fashion brand for women with a sportswear approach. Henceforth, the brand offered a range of leather goods such as bags, loafers, gloves and clothes. Céline Vipiana remained the designer from 1945-1997.\n\nIn 1964, the launch of the new fragrance \"Vent fou\" and the new ‘American Sulky’ collection of accessories gained success. The trench became the chief product of the house. Prompted by the popularity of leather, Céline opened a leather goods factory in Florence.\n\nIn 1973, Céline redesigned its logo with the intertwined \"C\" Sulky canvas, linked to the Arc-de-Triomphe, which appeared as a symbol for Parisians. At that time, Céline began its expansion in the world with the opening of various boutiques in Monte Carlo, Geneva, Hong Kong, Lausanne, Toronto and Beverly Hills.\n\nThe brand’s founders wished to be part of a charitable association, so Richard Vipiana established the Céline-Pasteur Prize, a sponsor for the American Hospital of Paris in 1973.\n\nIn 1987, Bernard Arnault decided to buy into Céline’s capital. However, it was only in 1996 that the brand was integrated into the LVMH group for 2.7 billion French francs ($540 million). LVMH propelled the brand to fame with the opening of a boutique at 36 avenue Montaigne in Paris.\n\nAmerican fashion designer Michael Kors was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for Céline in 1997. During his tenure at Céline, Kors brought modern femininity with a luxurious spirit.

{"id": "39547763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39547763", "title": "Charlie Brandt", "text": "Charlie Brandt\n\nCarl \"Charlie\" Brandt (February 23, 1957 – September 13, 2004) was an American serial killer. A former resident of Fort Wayne, Indiana and longtime resident of the Florida Keys, Brandt committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife, Teresa \"Teri\" Brandt, and decapitated and severely mutilated his niece, Michelle Jones, by removing her heart. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt hanged himself in Jones' garage after committing the murders.\n\nIt later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents – his pregnant mother fatally – in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident, and because of Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with human anatomy, investigators looked into the prospect that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.\n\nBrandt was the second child and only son of Herbert and Ilse Brandt, two German immigrants who originally lived in Connecticut. His father worked as a laborer for a division of International Harvester, eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. However, the family frequently moved, and as a result, Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools. He was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Every summer and Christmas, the family would vacation in Florida, where Brandt went on hunting trips with his father.\n\nOn the night of January 3, 1971, Brandt, then 13, walked into his parents' bathroom while Herbert was shaving and Ilse, who was eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Brandt shot both parents at point blank range; his father survived, but his mother died at the scene. Brandt then confronted his sister Angela, but his gun wouldn't fire. After a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down before she fled the house and sought help from neighbors. Brandt also left the house and knocked on the door of a girl next door named Sandi Radcliffe, telling her, \"Sandi, I just shot my mom and dad.\" Herbert Brandt later identified his son as his attacker.\n\nBecause he was too young to be charged with murder under Indiana law, Brandt appeared before a grand jury and was ordered to undergo three separate psychiatric evaluations, all of which couldn't determine what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, \"Basically, I was looking for mental illness. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, which I thought was what the court wanted to know.\" Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family. They never spoke of the incident again, and Brandt's younger sisters were never told about the shooting.\n\nShortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Florida. One year later, Brandt's father and sisters moved away after he remarried, while Brandt himself remained in Florida under the care of his grandparents. In 1984, Brandt got a degree on electronics and became a radar specialist. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Teri. No relatives were invited to their wedding. The couple settled in a beach house of Big Pine Key, the southernmost portion of the Florida Keys, in 1989. \n\nOn September 2, 2004, Brandt and Teri evacuated from their home ahead of Hurricane Ivan. Their niece, Michelle Lynn Jones, invited them to stay at her residence in near Orlando. Throughout the visit, Jones kept in regular contact with her mother, Mary Lou, as well as several friends. On the evening of September 13, one of Jones' friends, Lisa Emmons, was scheduled to visit her house. However, Jones discouraged her from coming after reporting that the Brandts had an argument after drinking. After that night, Jones stopped answering telephone calls, which alarmed her acquaintances.\n\nOn September 15, another one of Jones' friends, Debbie Knight, came to her house to check on her while on the phone with Jones' mother. After finding the front door locked, Knight tried to enter the house through the garage, where she found Brandt's decomposing body hanging from the rafters. Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Jones had been decapitated and disemboweled, with her heart and organs removed. Jones' head was also placed next to her own body. The weapons used in the crimes had been knives from Jones' kitchen.\n\nA search of Brandt's residence on Big Pine Key revealed that he was a monthly subscriber to Victoria's Secret catalogs; had an extensive collection of surgery-themed books, posters, and clippings; and regularly searched online for autopsy photos and snuff film websites depicting violence against women. Because Brandt's murder of Jones indicated methodology and past experience, and because he traveled often due to his job, police checked cold cases in Florida that matched his apparent \"modus operandi\", and launched requests for similar inquiries in the United States and abroad.

Combs have been used since prehistoric times, having been discovered in very refined forms from settlements dating back to 5,000 years ago in Persia.\n\nCombs consist of a shaft and teeth that are placed at a perpendicular angle to the shaft. Combs can be made out of a number of materials, most commonly plastic, metal or wood. Combs made from ivory and tortoiseshell were once common but concerns for the animals that produce them have reduced their usage. When made from wood, combs are largely made of boxwood, cherry wood or other fine-grained wood. Good quality wooden combs are usually handmade and polished.\n\nCombs come in various shapes and sizes depending on what they are used for. A hairdressing comb may have a thin, tapered handle for parting hair and close teeth. Common hair combs usually have wider teeth halfway and finer teeth for the rest of the comb. Hot combs were used solely for straightening hair during the colonial era in North America.\n\nA hairbrush comes in both manual and electric models. It is larger than a comb, and is also commonly used for shaping, styling and cleaning hair. A combination comb and hairbrush was patented in the 19th century.\n\nCombs can be used for many purposes. Historically, their main purpose was securing long hair in place, decorating the hair, matting sections of hair for dreadlocks, or keeping a kippah or skullcap in place. In Spain, a \"peineta\" is a large decorative comb used to keep a mantilla in place.\n\nIn industry and craft, combs are used in separating cotton fibres from seeds and other debris (the cotton gin, a mechanized version of the comb, is one of the machines that ushered in the Industrial Revolution). A comb is used to distribute colors in paper marbling to make the swirling colour patterns in comb-marbled paper.\n\nCombs are also a favorite tool for police investigators to collect hair and dandruff samples that can be used in ascertaining dead or living persons' identities, as well as their state of health, toxicological profiles, and so forth.\n\nStringing a plant's leaf or a piece of paper over one side of the comb and humming with cropped lips on the opposite side dramatically increases the high-frequency harmonic content of the hum produced by the human voice box, and the resulting spread sound spectrum can be modulated by changing the resonating frequency of the oral cavity.\n\nThis was the inspiration for the kazoo, a membranophone. Moreover, the comb is also a lamellophone. Comb teeth have harmonic qualities of their own, determined by their shape, length, and material. A comb with teeth of unequal length, capable of producing different notes when picked, eventually evolved into the thumb piano and musical box.\n\nThis type of comb has loose, thick teeth and is usually used on kinky or Afro-textured hair. It is longer and thinner than the typical comb, and it is sometimes worn in the hair. Afro picks were common in many melanesian and polynesian societies but were usually an adornment and worn on ceremonial occasions.\n\nSpecialized combs such as \"flea combs\" or \"nit combs\" can be used to remove macroscopic parasites and cause them damage by combing. A comb with teeth fine enough to remove nits is sometimes called a \"fine-toothed comb\", as in the metaphoric usage \"go over [something] with a fine-toothed comb\", meaning to search closely and in detail. Sometimes in this meaning, \"fine-toothed comb\" has been reanalysed as \"fine toothcomb\" and then shortened to \"toothcomb\", or changed into forms such as \"the finest of toothcombs\".\n\nSharing combs is a common cause of parasitic infections much like sharing a hat, as one user can leave a comb with eggs or live parasites, facilitating the transmission of lice, fleas, mites, fungi, and other undesirables. Siblings are also more likely to pass on nits to each other if they share a comb, so it is advisable to buy each child their own comb.\n\nAn unbreakable plastic comb is a comb that, despite being made of plastic rather than (more expensive) metal, does not shatter into multiple pieces if dropped on a hard surface such as bathroom tiles, a hardwood floor, or pavement. Such combs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century. Today most plastic combs are unbreakable as technology has reached a point of understanding the causation of brittleness in these products.\n\nModern artisan combs crafted from a wide variety of new and recycled materials have become popular over recent years. Used skateboard decks, vinyl records, brass, titanium alloy, acrylic and exotic wood are a few of the materials being used.\n\n\n"}

A subjective process are in many places the exclusive means of getting on a bidders list for public contract work.\n\nThese ratings and processes now make the whole issue of bonding and surety, (that has been around since the late 19th century to guarantee of performance and paying large premiums), obsolete and redundant since the public officials have already reduced risks and are paying premiums associated with reducing competition by using the prequalification process and rating systems.\n"}
{"id": "1276969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1276969", "title": "Dick Barton", "text": "Dick Barton\n\nDick Barton – Special Agent was a popular radio thriller serial broadcast in the BBC Light Programme between 7 October 1946 and 30 March 1951. Produced and directed by Raymond Raikes, Neil Tuson, and Charles Lefaux, it was aired in 15-minute episodes at 6.45 (later 6.15) each weekday evening. From 11 January 1947 an additional \"omnibus\" edition repeated all of the week's programmes each Saturday morning between 11.00 and 12.00. In all, 711 episodes were produced and the serial achieved a peak audience of 15 million. Its end was marked by a leading article in \"The Times\".\n\nThe serial followed the adventures of ex-Commando Captain Richard Barton MC (Noel Johnson, later Duncan Carse and Gordon Davies) who, with his mates Jock Anderson (Alex McCrindle) and Snowy White (John Mann), solved all sorts of crimes, escaped from dangerous situations, and saved the nation from disaster time and again.\n\nThe series was replaced from time to time by one about the adventures of an explorer. One episode was titled \"Plague on the Plateau\".\n\nBeginning in 1948, the Hammer film company made three \"Dick Barton\" films and, long after the radio series had been replaced by \"The Archers\", Southern Television made a television version in 1979. \"Dick Barton\" has also been adapted into a tongue-in-cheek stage play and a spoof radio comedy. Each version has featured the original's memorable signature tune, \"Devil's Galop\" by Charles Williams.\n\nThe series was devised by producer Norman Collins. The scripts were written by Edward J. Mason and Geoffrey Webb. The programme gave rise to a popular catchphrase of the late 1940s \"With one bound Dick was free!\" which made light of the fact that no matter how dangerous the cliffhanging situation Dick found himself in every evening, he would always escape easily.\n\nEarly ideas for the character's name included \"Bill Barton\" and \"Rex Drake\". However, the production team finally settled on the more dynamic Dick Barton. After the series had been on the air for some time, the BBC (conscious that the biggest audience for the programme was schoolboys) wrote a strict code of what Dick and his chums could and couldn't do, one clause famously stating \"Sex plays no part in his adventures.\"\n\n\nIn 1951 \"The Archers\" was first broadcast at 11.45 am on the Light Programme. BBC management, led by drama head Val Gielgud, had never felt comfortable with the sensationalism of \"Dick Barton\". \"The Archers\", which they considered more 'suitable', took \"Dick Barton\"'s place in the schedules from Easter 1951. \n\nIn 1972 as part of the BBC's Golden Jubilee, the BBC broadcast a new, abridged, 10 episode version of the first Barton serial - \"The Secret Weapon\". The cast included many members of the original cast, including Noel Johnson, John Mann, William Fox, Alex McCrindle, and Margaret Robertson.\n\nFrom October 1997 to May 1998, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-part sequel/pastiche called \"Richard Barton: General Practitioner!\", in which Dick Barton's son Richard is a country doctor caring for his apparently senile father, who retreats into fantasies based on his past adventures, believing that there are devilish enemies lurking around him. The series was written by Edward Mason's son Lol Mason, and featured Moray Watson as old Dick Barton, Robert Bathurst as his son Richard, Matilda Ziegler as Richard's wife Sally, Julian Dutton as young Dick Barton and Iain Cuthbertson as Jock Anderson. The series was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2015.\n\nIn 2009, BBC Audiobooks released \"Dick Barton and the Mystery of the Missing Formula\" (), a reading of a novel based on the radio serials written by Mike Dorrell and read by Toby Stephens.\n\nThe BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy. \nhttp://www.bbcshop.com/dick-barton-live/invt/9781910281253\n\nBeginning in 1948, the Hammer film company made three Dick Barton films, which were intended to be the beginning of a long-running series. Don Stannard, the star, was killed in a car crash in 1949, and Hammer decided to discontinue the series after the production of only three films. Hammer shelved plans to film the next Dick Barton film, \"Dick Barton in Africa\" written by John Gilling.\n\n\nIn 1979, Southern Television, one of the smaller ITV Network Companies, made a series of \"Dick Barton - Special Agent\" which ran in an early evening slot on the ITV Network.\n\nLike the original, it ran in 15 minute segments and was again accompanied by the iconic theme tune, the titles playing against an animated dagger and target motif. The production was blighted by financial troubles, though, and some critics said it was a mistake to try to resurrect the character.\n\nThe cast of the show were Tony Vogel as Dick Barton, Anthony Heaton as Snowey White, James Cosmo as Jock Anderson and John Gatrell as Sir Richard Marley. The 32x15 minutes episodes were transmitted by most of the ITV network on Saturdays and Sundays between January and April 1979. Southern, however, screened the show across consecutive nights from Mondays through to Thursday in the radio series' original timeslot of 6.45 to 7.00pm.\n\n\nThe complete series was released on DVD in March 2009, and in 2010 reruns of \"Dick Barton\" were shown on the British satellite television channel Film 24. By 2016 it had reappeared on another satellite channel, Talking Pictures TV. Rumours have suggested that a revival starring actor Nigel Havers was being planned, but to date this has come to nothing.\n\nA stage musical, \"Dick Barton Episode I, Special Agent\", written by Phil Willmott, directed by Ted Craig. Musical direction was by Stefan Bednarczyk. It premièred at the Warehouse Theatre in December 1998 to great acclaim. It was revived in 1999 and productions then toured Britain between 1998 and 2001. Following its success, further \"episodes\" were written and performed at the Warehouse Theatre:\n\nDecember 1999 was \"Dick Barton Episode II, The Curse Of The Pharaoh's Tomb\" by Phil Willmott.

This was commissioned by and premièred at the Warehouse Theatre.\n\nThe BBC's 1972 remake of the very first Dick Barton serial has been available to buy on BBC CD and tape for many years. For some time, this was the only Dick Barton radio material that was commercially available, having been recovered from a recording made by a member of the public. However, this has now changed.\n\nIn February 2011, BBC Radio 4 and a number of national newspapers reported that 338 episodes of Dick Barton recorded in the late 1940s had been recovered from the NFSA [National Film and Sound Archive] in Australia; these re-recordings, using the original BBC scripts and music cues, starred Douglas Kelly as Barton with Moira Carleton, Clifford Cowley, Richard Davies, William Lloyd and Patricia Kennedy. BBC Worldwide's audio arm have released a number of these on CD.\n\nThe Dick Barton radio series was later relaunched in the UK on BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7) and further Dick Barton CDs have been announced by AudioGO (using the NFSA recordings).\n\nThe BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy. \nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22689138\n\nThis new live production of the 1951 Barton story 'Dick Barton and the Trail of the Rocket' was recorded at the Y Theatre in Leicester using original scripts from 1951. It was released on CD by BBC Audio in July 2014, along with a number of bonus features. It is the only recording of this final Dick Barton serial to be made available by the BBC on CD. The original 1951 recording was never archived. It was billed as 'Dick Barton - Special Agent: LIVE' and starred Tim Bentinck in the lead.\n\nThe following Dick Barton dramas are now available to buy on CD (or as downloads) via BBC Audio:\n\n1 \"STORY 1\": 'Dick Barton and the Secret Weapon' (AKA 'Dick Barton: Special Agent) written by Edward J.Mason and originally broadcast 1946.

{"id": "6315775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6315775", "title": "Die Nibelungen", "text": "Die Nibelungen\n\nDie Nibelungen (\"The Nibelungs\") is a series of two silent fantasy films created by Austrian director Fritz Lang in 1924: Die Nibelungen: Siegfried and Die Nibelungen: Kriemhild's Revenge.\n\nThe screenplays for both films were co-written by Lang's then-wife Thea von Harbou, based upon the epic poem \"Nibelungenlied\" written around AD 1200. \"Die Nibelungen\" received its UK Premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where it played for forty performances between 29 April-20 June 1924. \"Siegfried\" was released in the U.S. on 23 August 1925, premiering at the Century Theatre in New York City in the short-lived Phonofilm sound-on-film process. \"Kriemhild's Revenge\" was released in the U.S. in 1928.\n\nThe title character Siegfried, son of King Siegmund of Xanten, masters the art of forging a sword at the shop of Mime. Siegfried hears the tales of the kingdom of Burgundy, the kings who rule there, as well as of Kriemhild, the princess of Burgundy. Siegfried announces he wants to win her hand in marriage, much to the amusement of the smiths. Siegfried demands to be told the way. Mime, who is envious of Siegfried's skill as a swordsmith, claims there is a shortcut to Burgundy through the Wood of Woden, wherein dwell all kinds of dangerous creatures. Siegfried encounters a dragon, and deviates from his path to slay it. He touches its hot, yellow blood and suddenly understands the language of the birds, who instruct him to bathe in the dragon's blood in order to become invincible — except for one spot on his shoulder blade, covered by a falling lime (linden) leaf.\n\nSoon after, the powerful Siegfried trespasses on the land of the Nibelungs and is attacked by Alberich, King of the Dwarves, who has turned himself invisible. Siegfried defeats Alberich, who offers Siegfried a net of invisibility and transformation if he spares his life, whereupon Alberich offers to make Siegfried \"the richest king on earth!\" [intertitle 1.14]. While Siegfried is mesmerized by the treasure and the sword Balmung, Alberich tries to defeat him, but dies in the attempt. Dying, Alberich curses all inheritors of the treasure and he and his dwarves turn to stone.\n\nSiegfried finally arrives in Burgundy in his new guise as King of twelve kingdoms. A fight breaks out between Siegfried and King Gunther and his adviser Hagen of Tronje, which is interrupted by the appearance of beautiful princess Kriemhild. Hagen asks Siegfried to aid Kriemhild's brother, King Gunther, to win the hand of Brunhild, the Queen of Iceland. The men travel to Brunhild's kingdom, where Siegfried feigns vassalage to Gunther so that he can avoid Brunhild's challenge and instead use the net's power of invisibility to help Gunther beat the powerful Queen in a threefold battle of strength. The men return to Burgundy where Gunther marries Brunhild and Siegfried weds Kriemhild.\n\nBrunhild is not, however, completely defeated. She suspects deceit and refuses to consummate the marriage. Hagen again convinces Siegfried to help. Siegfried transforms himself into Gunther and battles Brunhild and removes her arm-ring during battle, after which she submits to his will. Siegfried leaves the real Gunther to consummate the marriage.\n\nKriemhild discovers Brunhild's armlet and asks Siegfried about it. Siegfried discloses the truth to Kriemhild about his role in Brunhild's defeat. When the Nibelungen treasure that Siegfried acquired from Alberich arrives at the court of Burgundy as Kriemhild's wedding gift, Brunhild becomes more suspicious about Siegfried's feigned vassalage to Gunther. Brunhild dons the Queen Mother's jewellery and proceeds to the cathedral to enter as the first person, as is her right as Queen of Burgundy. Kriemhild tries to take Brunhild's right of way and an argument erupts between the two Queens. Kriemhild betrays her husband's and brother's secret to Brunhild, who then confronts Gunther.\n\nBrunhild demands that Siegfried must be killed, which she justifies by claiming that Siegfried stole her maidenhood [intertitle 1.94] when he struggled with her on her wedding night. Hagen von Tronje and King Gunther conspire to murder Siegfried during a hunt in the Odenwald. Hagen deceives Kriemhild into divulging Siegfried's weak spot by sewing a cross on the spot in Siegfried's tunic.\n\nAfter the hunt, Hagen challenges Siegfried to a race to a nearby spring. When Siegfried is on his knees drinking, Hagen pierces him from behind with a spear.\n\nIn an evil twist of bitter revenge, Brunhild confesses that she lied about Siegfried stealing her maidenhood in order to avenge Gunther's deceit of her.\n\nKriemhild demands her family avenge her husband's death at the hands of Hagen, but her family is complicit in the murder, and so they protect Hagen. Kriemhild swears revenge against Hagen while Brunhild commits suicide at the foot of Siegfried's corpse, which has been laid in state in the cathedral.\n\nKriemhild tries to win over the people of Burgundy to help her exact revenge against Hagen, to whom her brothers have sworn allegiance. Kriemhild bribes the people with money and treasure from the Nibelungen hoard. Margrave Rüdiger of Bechlarn arrives unannounced to woo Kriemhild on behalf of his King, King Etzel, who resides in the land of the Huns. Kriemhild initially declines, but ultimately she recognises the opportunity for revenge in her marriage with Etzel and in Rüdiger's allegiance to her. She forces Rüdiger to swear allegiance to her on his sword. At that very moment, news arrives that Hagen has stolen her wedding gift, the Nibelungen hoard, which Hagen has, unbeknownst to all, sunk into the Rhine river.\n\nKriemhild travels to Etzel's lands and accepts his hand. As a gift to Kriemhild for bearing him a son, Ortlieb, Etzel grants her a wish. Kriemhild requests Etzel to invite her family to celebrate the Midsummer Solstice with them in the Hun kingdom. In the meantime, Kriemhild bribes Etzel's Hun warriors with money and treasure to avenge her and attack Hagen.\n\nWhen the Burgundians arrive, the Huns launch several unsuccessful attempts. Instead, the Huns launch an attack on the Burgundian soldiers during their feast in the subterranean caves where the Huns reside. The Burgundian Knight Dankwart manages to escape the melee and warns the Burgundian kings who are feasting with Etzel and Kriemhild in Etzel's palace. Upon hearing of the treacherous attack, Hagen of Tronje murders Etzel's son, and battle breaks out. Dietrich of Bern manages to negotiate an exit from the hall for Etzel's royal entourage, which leaves the Burgundian guests imprisoned in Etzel's palace.\n\nThe remaining 45 minutes of the film consists of multiple battles in which the Huns launch multiple attacks on the Burgundians. Kriemhild offers her family freedom if they surrender Hagen to her. They decline. Ultimately Kriemhild calls upon Rüdiger to fulfill his oath of allegiance by attacking Hagen. Rüdiger refuses, but is forced to by Etzel. At the beginning of the battle, Rüdiger is killed by Volker of Alzey after Rüdiger of Bechlarn himself smote his nearly son-in-law Giselher of Burgundy with his sword. Gerenot carries his dead brother outside the hall to show his sister what she has done with her vindictiveness. Kriemhild grieves for Giselher and begs Gerenot for a last time to surrender Hagen of Tronje to her, but he refuses again and so is killed by the Huns. In a final act of desperation, Kriemhild commands the palace be set alight.\n\nAs the flames smoulder, only Gunther and Hagen survive. Dietrich of Bern fetches the two remaining men from the palace and delivers them to Kriemhild, who demands Hagen to reveal the hiding place of the Nibelungen hoard. When Hagen states that he has sworn not to reveal the hiding place as long as one of his kings is still alive, Kriemhild commands Gunther's beheading. When Hagen reveals that no one now knows the location of the treasure apart from him and God, and that God will never tell more than he does, Kriemhild grabs Siegfried's sword from Hagen and cuts him down. Infuriated by Kriemhild's act of murder, Sword Master Hildebrandt stabs Kriemhild from behind.\n\nEtzel's final words are that Kriemhild should be taken back home to her dead husband, Siegfried, because she never belonged to any other man [intertitle 2.159].\n\nIn 2010, film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film four out of a possible four stars, calling it \"a[n] epic masterpiece\". In his review he wrote, \"A rich treasure trove of folklore and magic, in which Lang creates a mystical geometric universe where the characters play against vast architectural landscapes.\"\n\n"}

They belong to the group of electroactive polymers (EAP). DE actuators (DEA) transform electric energy into mechanical work. They are lightweight and have a high elastic energy density. They have been investigated since the late 1990s. Many prototype applications exist. Every year, conferences are held in the US and Europe.\n\nA DEA is a compliant capacitor (see image), where a passive elastomer film is sandwiched between two compliant electrodes. When a voltage formula_1 is applied, the electrostatic pressure formula_2 arising from the Coulomb forces acts between the electrodes. The electrodes squeeze the elastomer film. The equivalent electromechanical pressure formula_3 is twice the electrostatic pressure formula_2 and is given by:\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere formula_6 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_7 is the dielectric constant of the polymer and formula_8 is the thickness of the elastomer film. Usually, strains of DEA are in the order of 10–35%, maximum values reach 300% (the acrylic elastomer VHB 4910, commercially available from 3M, which also sports a high elastic energy density and a high electrical breakdown strength.)\n\nReplacing the electrodes with soft hydrogels allows ionic transport to replace electron transport. Aqueous ionic hydrogels can deliver potentials of multiple kilovolts, despite the onset of electrolysis at below 1.5 V.\n\nThe difference between the capacitance of the double layer and the dielectric leads to a potential across the dielectric that can be millions of times greater than that across the double layer. Potentials in the kilovolt range can be realized without electrochemically degrading the hydrogel.\n\nDeformations are well controlled, reversible, and capable of high-frequency operation. The resulting devices can be perfectly transparent. High-frequency actuation is possible. Switching speeds are limited only by mechanical inertia. The hydrogel's stiffness can be thousands of times smaller than the dielectric's, allowing actuation without mechanical constraint across a range of nearly 100% at millisecond speeds. They can be biocompatible.\n\nRemaining issues include drying of the hydrogels, ionic build-up, hysteresis, and electrical shorting.\n\nEarly experiments in semiconductor device research relied on ionic conductors to investigate field modulation of contact potentials in silicon and to enable the first solid-state amplifiers. Work since 2000 has established the utility of electrolyte gate electrodes. Ionic gels can also serve as elements of high-performance, stretchable graphene transistors.\n\nFilms of carbon powder or grease loaded with carbon black were early choices as electrodes for the DEAs. Such materials have poor reliability and are not available with established manufacturing techniques. Improved characteristics can be achieved with liquid metal, sheets of graphene, coatings of carbon nanotubes, surface-implanted layers of metallic nanoclusters and corrugated or patterned metal films.\n\nThese options offer limited mechanical properties, sheet resistances, switching times and easy integration. Silicones and acrylic elastomers are other alternatives.\n\nThe requirements for an elastomer material are:\n\n\nMechanically prestretching the elastomer film offers the possibility of enhancing the electrical breakdown strength. Further reasons for prestretching include:\n\n\nThe elastomers show a visco-hyperelastic behavior. Models that describe large strains and viscoelasticity are required for the calculation of such actuators.\n\nMaterials used in research include graphite powder, silicone oil / graphite mixtures, gold electrodes. The electrode should be conductive and compliant. Compliance is important so that the elastomer is not constrained mechanically when elongated.\n\nFilms of polyacrylamide hydrogels formed with salt water can be laminated onto the dielectric surfaces, replacing electrodes.\n\nDEs based on silicone (PDMS) and natural rubber are promising research fields. Properties such as fast response times and efficiency are superior using natural rubber based DEs compared to VHB (acrylic elastomer) based DEs for strains under 15%.\n\nConfigurations include:\n\n\nDielectric elastomers offer multiple potential applications with the potential to replace many electromagnetic actuators, pneumatics and piezo actuators. A list of potential applications include:\n\n\n"}

In Exodus 8:16–20 it is used during the plagues of Egypt by the Egyptian priests. In Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 9:10 it refers to the method by which the Ten Commandments were written on tablets of stone that were brought down from biblical Mount Sinai by Moses. It was used once by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke to describe how he had cast out demons.\n\nThe first time the phrase \"finger of God\" appears is in the Hebrew Bible, in the eighth chapter, in the paragraph of verses sixteen through twenty of the Book of Exodus, which reads\nThe second time the phrase \"finger of God\" appears is at the last verse, verse eighteen of the thirty-first chapter of the same book, which reads \"And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.\"\n\nThe third time the phrase appears, and the last time in the Hebrew Bible, is a second reference to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, and is found in Deuteronomy 9:10, which says \"And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.\"\n\nThe phrase is also used by Jesus in the Christian New Testament during his proof that he did not cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub. He said, \"But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.\"\n\nIn the New Testament story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery, Jesus writes in the dust of the earth with his finger. Pope Benedict XVI notes from St Augustine that this gesture can be seen as portraying Christ as the divine legislator; Jesus' actions in writing in the dust are redolent of the Finger of God writing the Law on tablets of stone.\n\n\n"}

She founded a number of animal advocacy groups, including the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) in 1875, and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in 1898, and was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage.\n\nShe was the author of a number of books and essays, including \"The Intuitive Theory of Morals\" (1855), \"On the Pursuits of Women\" (1863), \"Cities of the Past\" (1864), \"Criminals, Idiots, Women and Minors\" (1869), \"Darwinism in Morals\" (1871), and \"Scientific Spirit of the Age\" (1888).\n\nFrances was a member of the prominent Cobbe family, descended from Archbishop Charles Cobbe, Primate of Ireland. She was born in Newbridge House in the family estate in what is now Donabate, Co. Dublin.\n\nCobbe worked at the Red Lodge Reformatory and lived with the owner, Mary Carpenter, from 1858 to 1859, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school and moved out.\n\nCobbe formed a relationship with the Welsh sculptor Mary Lloyd (1819-1896), whom she met in Rome in 1861 and lived with from 1864 until Lloyd's death. That death, in 1896, affected Cobbe badly. Her friend, the writer Blanche Atkinson, writing, “The sorrow of Miss Lloyd’s death changed the whole aspect of existence for Miss Cobbe. The joy of life had gone. It had been such a friendship as is rarely seen – perfect in love, sympathy, and mutual understand.” Around 1891 and in danger of losing their home at Hengwrt, in which Lloyd had inherited a share on the death of her parents, the couple were relieved by a legacy of over £25,000 from the widow of Richard Vaughan Yates. They are buried together at Saint Illtud Church Cemetery, Llanelltyd, Gwynedd, Wales. In letters and published writing, Cobbe referred to Lloyd alternately as \"husband,\" wife,\" and \"dear friend.\"\n\nCobbe founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection (SPALV) in 1875, the world's first organisation campaigning against animal experiments, and in 1898 the BUAV, two groups that remain active. She was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and writer of editorial columns for London newspapers on suffrage, property rights for women, and opposition to vivisection. Around 1880, with Louise Twining, she founded Homes for Workhouse Girls.\nCobbe met the Darwin family during 1868. Emma Darwin liked her, \"Miss Cobbe was very agreeable.\" Frances persuaded Charles Darwin to read Immanuel Kant's \"Metaphysics of Ethics\". She met him again during 1869 in Wales, and apparently interrupted him when he was quite ill, and tried to persuade him to read John Stuart Mill—and indeed Darwin had read Frances's review of Mill's book, \"The Subjection of Women\". She then lost his trust when without permission she edited and published a letter he'd written to her. Her critique of Darwin's \"Descent of Man\", \"Darwinism in Morals\" was published in \"The Theological Review\" in April 1871.\n\nCobbe's activism for women's rights included advocating for women to be allowed to take university examinations and therefore earn a degree at Oxford and Cambridge. She presented a paper at the Social Science Congress in 1862 to argue the issue \n\nA portrait of her is included in the mural of heroic women by Walter P. Starmer unveiled in 1921 in the church of St Jude-on-the-Hill in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London.\n\nHer name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.\n\nHer name is listed on the south face of the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4408111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4408111", "title": "Francophile", "text": "Francophile\n\nA Francophile (Gallophile) is a person who has a strong affinity towards any or all of the French language, French history, French culture or French people. That affinity may include France itself or its history, language, cuisine, literature, etc. The term \"Francophile\" can be contrasted with Francophobe (or Gallophobe), someone who dislikes all that is French.\nFrancophilia often arises in former French colonies, where the elite spoke French and adopted many French habits. In other European countries such as Romania and Russia, French culture has also long been popular among the upper class.\n\nHistorically, Francophilia has been associated with supporters of the philosophy of Enlightenment during and after the French Revolution, where democratic uprisings challenged the autocratic regimes of Europe.\n\nRomania has a long and deeply entrenched tradition of Francophilia beginning after the Enlightenment and Revolutionary periods. No doubt the most famous contemporary Romanian Francophile is Eugen Weber (1925–2007), a prodigious author and lecturer in both English and French on French history. In his book \"My France: politics, culture, myth\", he writes: \"Social relations, manners, attitudes that others had to learn from books, I lived in my early years. Romanian francophilia, Romanian francophony... Many Romanians, in my day, dreamed of France; not many got there\".\n\nWith the efforts to build Romania into a modern nation-state, with a national language and common national heritage, in the 19th century, the Romanian language was deliberately reoriented to its Latin heritage by a steady import of French neologisms suited to contemporary civilization and culture. \"For ordinary Romanians, keen on the idea of the Latin roots of their language, 'Romance' meant 'French.'\" An estimated 39% of Romanian vocabulary consists of borrowings from French, with an estimated 20% of \"everyday\" Romanian vocabulary.\n\nBoia writes: \"Once launched on the road of Westernization, the Romanian elite threw itself into the arms of France, the great Latin sister in the West. When we speak of the Western model, what is to be understood is first and foremost the French model, which comes far ahead of the other Western reference points.\" He quotes no less than the leading Romanian politician Dimitrie Drăghicescu, writing in 1907: \"As the nations of Europe acquire their definitive borders and their social life becomes elaborated and crystallized within the precise limits of these borders, so their spiritual accomplishments will approach those of the French, and the immaterial substance of their souls will take on the luminous clarity, the smoothness and brilliance of the French mentality.\" Bucharest was rebuilt in the style of Paris in the 19th century, giving the city the nickname the \"Paris of the East\".\n\nOther notable Romanian Francophiles include Georges Enesco, Constantin Brâncuși, Emil Cioran, Mircea Eliade, Eugène Ionesco and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel.\n\n18th and 19th century Russian Francophilia is familiar to many from Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina\", and his characters from the Russian aristocracy converse in French and give themselves French names. At the time, the language of diplomacy and higher education across much of Europe was French. Russia, recently \"modernized\", or \"Westernized\", by the rule of sovereigns from Peter the Great to Catherine the Great was no exception. The Russian elite, in the early 18th century, were educated in the French tradition and made a conscious effort to imitate the manners of France. Their descendants, a generation or two later, were no longer \"imitating\" French customs but grew up with them, and the strong impact of the French culture on Russian upper and even middle classes was evident, on a smaller scale than in the 18th century, until the Revolution of 1917.\n\n\"Afrancesado\" (lit. \"turned-French\") was the term used for Spanish and Portuguese partisans of Enlightenment ideas, liberalism or the French Revolution. It also denoted supporters of the French occupation of Iberia and of the First French Empire.\n\nIn the 18th century, French was the language of German elites. A notable Francophile was King Frederick the Great of Prussia or Frédéric as he preferred to call himself. Frederick spoke and wrote notably better French than he did German, and all of his books were written in French, a choice of language that was of considerable embarrassment to German nationalists in the 19th and 20th centuries when Frederick became the preeminent German national hero. One source noted: \"Nor did Frederick have any time for German cultural chauvinism. As an ardent Francophile in matters literary and artistic, he took a low view of the German language, spoke it imperfectly himself, and once boasted that he had not read a book in German since his early youth. His preferences in music, art and architecture were overwhelmingly Italian and French\". The French \"philosophe\" Voltaire when he visited Berlin to meet his admirer Frederick noted that everyone at the Prussian Court spoke the most exquisite French and German was only used when addressing servants and soldiers. Another German Francophile was King Ludwig II of Bavaria, a.k.a. \"Mad King Ludwig\". Ludwig felt a great deal of affinity for King Louis XIV of France, the \"Sun King\" and liked to call himself the \"Moon King\" to suggest a parallel between himself and his hero. Ludwig loved to collect memorabilia relating to Louis and his Linderhof Palace was modeled after the Palace of Trianon. An even more strikingly example of Ludwig's architectural Francophila was the Palace of Herrenchiemsee, which was a copy of the Palace of Versailles.\n\nFrancophilia or \"Rattachism\" is a marginal political ideology in some parts of Belgium. Rattachism would mean the incorporation of French speaking Belgium, Wallonia (and sometimes Brussels; more rarely of the entire Belgium) into France. This movement has existed since the Belgian state came into existence in 1830.\n\nThe Manifesto for Walloon culture of 1983 relaunched in 2003, and a series of discussions witnessed a will of emancipation.\n\nThe establishment of the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, in 1192, was the beginning of intense French influence on the island for the next three centuries. That influence, which touched almost every aspect of life on the island, would endure even after the end of Lusignan domination. It survives as part of Cypriot culture. The Republic of Cyprus became an associate member of the Francophonie in 2006.\n\nThe Armenians of Cilicia welcomed the Frankish, or French, Crusaders of the Middle Ages as fellow Christians. There was much exchange, and the last dynasty to rule Armenian Cilicia, the Lusignans (who ruled Cyprus), was of French origin.\n\nDuring the reign of Louis XIV, many Armenian manuscripts were taken into the National Library of France. Armenia and Armenian characters are featured in the works of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau. The first instance of Armenian studies began with the creation of an Armenian department in the School of Oriental languages, at the initiative of Napoleon.\n\nAn important figure of Armenian Francophilia was that of Stepan Vosganian (1825–1901). Arguably the first Armenian \"intellectual\" and literary critic, Vosganian \"represents the prototype of a long line of Armenian intellectuals nurtured in and identified with European, and particularly French, culture\". Educated in Paris, he was a champion of liberalism and the positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte, and he took part in the French Revolution of 1848.\n\nThe French political classes were on the whole supportive of the Armenian national movement. The French–Armenian Agreement (1916) was a political and military accord to create the Armenian Legion in the French Army to fight on the Allied side of World War I, in return for promises of recognition of Armenian independence. The Armenian Legion engaged successfully in Anatolia and Palestine during World War I, particularly at the Battle of Arara and during the Franco-Turkish War.\n\nThe oldest documented possible contact between the two sides was the marriage of Stephen Uroš I of Serbia and Helen of Anjou in the 13th century.\n\nThe first important contacts of French and Serbs came only in the 19th century, when the first French travel writers wrote about their travels to Serbia. At that time Karađorđe Petrović, the leader of the Serbian Revolution, sent a letter to Napoleon expressing his admiration. On the other hand, in the French parliament, Victor Hugo asked France to assist in protecting Serbia and the Serbian population from Ottoman crimes. Diplomatic relations with France were established on 18 January 1879. Rapid development of bilateral relations done that people in Serbia in \"mighty France\" seen great new friend that will protect them from the Ottomans and Habsburgs. Relations between Serbia and France would go upwards until the First World War, when the \"common struggle\" against a common enemy would reach its peak. Before the war, France would win sympathy of local population by building railways by opening of French schools and a consulate and a Bank. Several Serbian kings were at universities in Paris as well as a large part of the future diplomats. Serbs have built a sense of Francophilia because the activities moved them away from the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires. For Serbs until 1914, French have become major allies what were even a threat for traditional inclination towards Russia. The great humanitarian and military assistance that France sent to Serbia during First World War, assistance in the evacuation of children, civilians and military at the end, and the support of French newspaper headlines even today are deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of large number of Serbs.\n\nNotable Serbian Francophiles include Ilija Garašanin and Sava Šumanović.\n\nThe traditional Anglo-French antagonism has made Francophilia something of a rarity within the United Kingdom, but there have been exceptions.\n\n\n\n\nAs with much of the Western world and the Middle East at the time, Francophilia was quite common in Iran in the 19th century, and even so more in the 20th century. In Iran, many key politicians and diplomats of the 20th century were French-educated or avid Francophiles. Among them Teymur Bakhtiar, the founder of the Iranian intelligence agency, SAVAK; Amir-Abbas Hoveida, Prime Minister of Iran from 1965 to 1977; Hassan Pakravan, a diplomat and intelligence figure; Nader Jahanbani, General under the last Shah; and Abdullah Entezam-Saltaneh, another famous diplomat to the West.\n\nOrientalism first arose in Early Modern France with Guillaume Postel and the French Embassy to the court of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Later, when Mehmed IV sent the ambassador Müteferrika Süleyman Ağa to the court of Louis XIV in 1669, it caused a sensation that triggered the Turquerie fashion craze in France and then the rest of Western Europe, which lasted until well into the 19th century.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire granted France special privileges on account of the Franco-Ottoman alliance. French mercantilism was protected, French subjects were exempt from the taxes and tributes normally required of Christian residents of the Empire, no French subjects could be taken into Ottoman slavery and French subjects were granted full freedom of worship. Thus, France became the unofficial protector of all Catholics in the East.\n\nIn the late 18th and 19th centuries, French and British colonial influence increased in Anatolia and the Middle East, and the French language and customs penetrated deep into the Ottoman learned classes and aristocracy; French was the preferred second language, rich Ottomans sent their children to school and Universities in France and the Western \"Enlightenment\" was associated with French culture Modern Turkish continues to have many French loanwords that were adopted in this period, and 5,350 Turkish words are of French origin, according to the Turkish Language Society, one eighth of a standard dictionary. List of replaced loanwords in Turkish#Loanwords of French origin Francophilia still exists to a rather limited extent in modern Turkey. Vestiges of the 19th and early 20th century Francophilia include the famous Pera Palace hotel in Istanbul.\n\nThe French Revolution and its ideals of \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" inspired many secular and progressive movements in Ottoman Turkey, including the Young Turk movement that would go on to create the Republic of Turkey. Napoleon's breaking of the age-old Franco-Ottoman alliance by conquering Ottoman-controlled Egypt also had an effect. Muhammad Ali the Great, who became the Ottoman \"vali\" (governor) of Egypt in 1805 and ruled as a \"de facto\" independent ruler until his death in 1848 had been strongly impressed with the Napoleon's \"Armée d'Orient\", and imported French veterans of the Napoleonic wars to train his army. Egypt was very much in the French sphere of influence politically, economically and culturally in the 19th century, and French was the preferred language of Egypt's elites right up to the 1952 revolution. At the court of the Khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt, better known as Isma'il the Magnificent the languages used were French and Turkish. Reflecting his Francophilia, the French-educated Isma'il emulated Baron Haussmann by tearing down much of Cairo to rebuild it in the style of Paris. Even today, the architecture of Downtown Cairo closely resembles that of downtown Paris.\n\nIn Lebanon, Franophilia is very common among the Christian Maronites who have seen the 19th century viewed the French as their \"guardian angels\", their special protectors and friends in their struggles against the Muslims. In 1860, the French intervened to put a stop to the massacres of the Maronites by the Muslims and the Druze which were being permitted by the Ottoman authorities, earning them the lasting thanks of the Maronites. Starting in the 19th century, much of the Maronite elite was educated at Jesuit schools in France, making the Maronites one of the most ardently Francophile groups in the Ottoman Empire. The Lebanese writer Charles Corm in a series of poems in French published after World War I portrayed the Lebanese as a \"Phoenician\" people whose Christianity and Francophilia made them part of the West and who had nothing to do either with the Arabs or Islam.\n\nPrince Saionji Kinmochi, a \"genro\" (elder statesmen) was educated in France, where he received a law degree at the Sorbonne. In words of the Canadian historian Margaret Macmillan, Saionji \"...loved the French, their culture and their liberal traditions. He even spoke French in his sleep. To the end of his life, he drank Vichy water and wore Houbigant cologne, which had to be imported specially for him\". Prince Saionji was merely an extreme case of the Francophilia that characterized Meiji Japan. The Justice Minister, Etō Shimpei was an admirer of the French who modeled the legal and administrative systems together with the police force after that of France. A French lawyer Gustave Boissonade was recruited to draft the Japanese legal code, which is why the Japanese legal code today very closely resembles the Code Napoleon. Another French lawyer, Prosper Gambet-Gross served as the special advisor to Kawaji Toshiyoshi who created a French-style police force for Japan. The Japanese educational system from 1872 onward was modeled after the French educational system and in the same year Japan was divided into prefectures as the French administrative system was considered by the Japanese to be the best in Europe. The Japanese received a French military mission in 1870 to train their army as the French Army was considered the best in the world. After France's defeat in the war of 1870-71, the Japanese sent the French military mission home, to be replaced by a German military mission as the German victory led the Japanese to the conclusion that the Germans were better soldiers.\n\nThe Japanese writer Kafū Nagai wrote after visiting France: \"No matter how much I wanted to sing Western songs, they were all very difficult. Had I, born in Japan, no choice but to sing Japanese songs? Was there a Japanese song that expressed my present sentiment -- a traveler who had immersed himself in love and the arts in France but was now going back to the extreme end of the Orient where only death would follow monotonous life? . . . I felt totally forsaken. I belonged to a nation that had no music to express swelling emotions and agonized feelings.\"\n\nColonel Jean-Bédel Bokassa of the Army of the Central African Republic seized power in 1965 and ruled until he was deposed by French troops in 1979. Bokassa was a great Francophile who maintained extremely close relations with France, often going elephant hunting with the French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. In 1977, Bokassa in imitation of his hero Napoleon crowned himself Emperor and renamed his nation the Central African Empire. Bokassa was also notorious as one of Africa's most brutal dictators, engaging in cannibalism, becoming so vicious that even the French could not stand supporting his regime anymore and thus the French Foreign Legion deposed the Emperor in 1979. Bokassa once nonchalantly told a French diplomat after his overthrow about the banquets he used to organize with the French style cooking that: \"You never noticed it, but you ate human flesh.\"\n\nOmar Bongo, the long time dictator of Gabon from 1967 until his death in 2009 was described by \"The Economist\" in 2016 as \"every inch the Francophile\" who was very close to successive governments in Paris from the time he came to power until his death. In 2012, the country declared an intention to add English as a second official language, as Ali Bongo who succeeded his father as president does not share his father's Francophilia. However, it was later clarified that the country intended to introduce English as a first foreign language in schools, while keeping French as the general medium of instruction and the sole official language.\n\nPresident Félix Houphouët-Boigny of the Côte d'Ivoire was described as a \"staunch Francophile\" who maintained very close links with France, and successfully insisted that the French name for his country be used instead of the Ivory Coast. It was Houphouet-Boigny who coined the term \"Françafrique\" to describe the \"special relationship\" between France and its former African colonies, in which Francophone African nations were in the French political, cultural, military and economic sphere of influence, something which Houphouet-Boigny welcomed, though France's influence in Africa has been highly controversial given that most of the African regimes the French supported have been dictatorships.\n\nWith the inception of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the institution of French immersion in many schools following the Official Languages Act of 1969, many Canadians of English heritage have developed a greater appreciation for the French culture that is a part of the Canadian identity. English and French are the two official languages of Canada and two of its founding languages.\n\nIn America, there is great interest in French culture, including French food, art, philosophy, politics, as well as the French lifestyle in general. Historically, French style, particularly that of Paris, has long been considered the height of sophistication by Americans of all social classes.\n\nFrench support of the American Revolution was probably a significant factor in shaping American's feelings towards France. Prior to that, the French had been seen as rivals for control of North America until their decisive defeat in the French and Indian War. With the elimination of France as a major colonial power in North America, the rivalry between American colonists and British interests became primary, and France's role switched to that of a counter to British power.\n\nPro-French sentiment was probably strengthened by the overthrow of the French monarchy and the creation of a \"brother-republic\" in France. Notwithstanding the turmoil of the French Revolution, certain disputes between the two countries, and the renewal of British-American ties, generally good relations continued. During the Napoleonic era, the Louisiana Purchase, and the entry of the United States into another war against Britain, concurrent with Franco-British hostilities, gave a certain sense of common cause.\n\nAmong the most famous early American Francophiles was Thomas Jefferson. Even during the excesses of the Reign of Terror, Jefferson refused to disavow the revolution because he was, as Jean Yarbrough wrote, \"convinced that the fates of the two republics were indissolubly linked. To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America.\" Commenting on the continuing revolutions in the Netherlands and France, Jefferson predicted that \"this ball of liberty, I believe most piously, is now so well in motion that it will roll round the globe, at least the enlightened part of it, for light & liberty go together. it is our glory that we first put it into motion.\" Jefferson would often sign his letters \"Affectionately adieu\" and commented late in life \"France, freed from that monster, Bonaparte, must again become the most agreeable country on earth.\" The 1995 film \"Jefferson in Paris\" by James Ivory, recalls the connection. The \"staunchly Francophile\" Jefferson and, by extension, his adherents or \"Jeffersonians\", were characterized by his political enemies, the Federalists, as \"decadent, ungodly and immoral Francophiles\".\n\nBenjamin Franklin, who spent seven years as the popular United States Ambassador to France was also a Francophile. Massachusetts Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. spent his first three grades in a Parisian school and majored in Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard. Henry Cabot Lodge Sr., his grandfather, was also a Francophile and befriended Jean Jules Jusserand, the French Ambassador to the US.\n\nMany Americans have studied at art schools in France, including the Beaux Arts academy in Paris, the premier institution of its kind in the country. The students and graduated alumni have been deeply influential on American style, particularly during the 19th and the early 20th centuries.\n\nFrancophile sentiment in America was deeply influential on American public opinion and involvement in both World Wars. The Francophile filmmaker Preston Sturges always considered France his \"second home\" where he spent much of his childhood, was fluent in French and was greatly influenced by the films of his close friend René Clair. On the subject of cuisine, Julia Child is probably the most famous of many Francophile-American chefs and of many American graduates of French cooking-schools.\n\nOther notable francophiles include actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bill Maher, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, Molly Ringwald, Steven Gabrielle and Robert Crawford. The director and actor Woody Allen is a Francophile whose films often made references to French cinema, philosophy and novels. A recurring theme in Allen's films is the celebration of Paris as the ideal place for romantic love. Allen's 1982 film \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" frequently pays homage to the work of Jean Renoir while Allen has described François Truffaut as his favorite director. The Francophile hero of Allen's 2011 film \"Midnight in Paris\" Gil Pender bears striking similarities with Allen, leading to reviewers to suggest that the character of Pender is a stand-in for the director-writer.\n\nThe French-American Chamber of Commerce organization has worked to promote business ties between the two countries.

Despite this history, the Haitian elite was traditionally very Francophile to the point that the Haitian writer Jean Price-Mars published a book in 1928 \"Ainsi Parla l'Oncle\" (So Spoke the Uncle) accusing the elite of \"bovarysme\", of intentionally neglecting and ignoring traditional Haitian folk culture as it had too many West African elements and was not French enough for the elite. About 10% of Haiti's population speak French as their first language while the other 90% speak \"Kréyol\" (a mixture of French and various West African languages) that has often been mocked by the Francophile Haitian elite as a bastardized French. In Haiti, the question of whatever one speaks French or \"Kréyol\" is racially charged as the elite tended to be mulattos while the masses are black.\n\nAustralian people are mostly leaning toward francophilia. Australia is tied to France through history: visit from Lapérouse and assistance during World War I. Australian also appreciate and look up to French culture and cuisine.

{"id": "37986566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37986566", "title": "Gone Girl (novel)", "text": "Gone Girl (novel)\n\nGone Girl is a thriller novel by the writer Gillian Flynn. It was published by Crown Publishing Group in June 2012. The novel soon made the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. The novel's suspense comes from Nick Dunne, and whether he is involved in the disappearance of his wife.\n\nIn several interviews, Flynn has said that she was inspired to write the novel by the disappearance of Laci Peterson. In portraying her principal characters who are out-of-work writers, she made use of her own experience being laid off from her job as a writer for \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\nCritics in the United States positively received and reviewed the novel. Reviewers praised the novel's use of unreliable narration, plot twists, and suspense.\n\nA film adaptation, directed by David Fincher and written by Flynn, with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike starring, was released on October 3, 2014. The film was met with both commercial success and widespread critical acclaim.\n\nThe first part of the novel centres on Nick Dunne and his wife Amy's marriage. Its point of view alternates between that of Nick and Amy, whose perspectives on their marriage are very different. For example, Nick describes the couple's relationship in the present day, while Amy's diary entries depict their relationship in the past. Amy's diary portrays Nick as an aggressive, moody, idle, and threatening husband, while Nick describes Amy as someone who is needlessly difficult, anti-social, stubborn, and an irrational perfectionist.\n\nWhen Nick and Amy both lose their jobs in New York City, they relocate to Nick's hometown in North Carthage, Missouri to help take care of Nick's sick mother. This causes their marriage to take a turn: Amy loved their life in New York, hates living in the Midwest, and soon begins to resent Nick for making her move to his hometown.\n\nOn their wedding anniversary, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick eventually becomes a suspect in her disappearance. Among other reasons, his lack of emotion about Amy's disappearance and the discovery that Amy was pregnant when she went missing lead both the police and the public to believe that Nick may have murdered his wife.\n\nIn the second half of the book, the reader learns that the main characters are unreliable narrators, and that the reader is not being given all of the information. Nick is revealed to have been cheating on his wife, and Amy is revealed to be alive and in hiding, and trying to frame Nick for her \"death\" as revenge for his perceived wrongs against her. Her pregnancy and her diary entries are revealed to be fake; Amy fabricated them in order to further incriminate Nick. Her plan is foiled, however, when she is robbed at the motel she is hiding in. Desperate, she seeks help from her ex-boyfriend Desi Collings, who agrees to hide her in his lake house but soon becomes possessive, causing Amy to feel trapped.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick has discovered that Amy is framing him for her murder based on the items she bought using credit cards in his name and hid in his sister Margo's woodshed, along with her anniversary gift of Punch and Judy puppets, one of which is missing a handle. However, since the clues she left for him on their annual anniversary treasure hunt are so ambiguous and based on their inside jokes that no one else would get them, he has no way of proving it.\n\nTogether, he and his lawyer work to change the public's perception of Nick. He is granted an interview with a popular talk show host, during which Nick pretends to be apologetic for his infidelity and appeals to Amy to come back. It goes well with the public, but unfortunately the police have discovered the items in the woodshed that Nick swore he didn't buy: boxes of demeaning and violent porn videos, and Amy's diary. A few weeks later, they bring out the missing handle from the Punch and Judy puppets that had been soaked in Amy's blood and discovered in the fireplace, and arrest Nick.\n\nAt Desi's lake house, Amy sees the TV interview and is convinced that Nick really does want her back. She murders Desi after seducing him and returns to her husband, who is out on bond. Upon her return, she fabricates a story that she had been kidnapped and imprisoned by Desi. Although Nick knows she's lying, he has no proof and is forced to return to married life with Amy as the media storm dies down.\n\nThough forced to remain with his wife, Nick soon begins writing a memoir detailing Amy's crimes and deceptions. Aware of Nick's intentions to expose her lies, Amy uses Nick's semen they had saved at a fertility clinic to make herself pregnant. She then forces him to delete his book by threatening to keep him from their unborn child. In the end, Nick deletes his memoir and chooses to stay with Amy for his child's sake.\n\n\nGillian Flynn is a former writer for \"Entertainment Weekly\" who wrote two popular novels prior to \"Gone Girl\" — \"Sharp Objects\" and \"Dark Places\". \"Gone Girl\" is her best selling book to date. Her other two books were about people incapable of making commitments, but in this novel, she tried to depict the ultimate commitment, marriage: \"I liked the idea of marriage told as a he-said, she-said story, and told by two narrators who were perhaps not to be trusted.\" Flynn has also described marriage as \"the ultimate mystery.\"\n\nFlynn admits to putting some of herself in the character of Nick Dunne. Like Dunne, she was a popular culture writer. Also, like Dunne, she was laid off after many years at the same job. Flynn said, \"I certainly wove that experience, that sense of having something that you were going to do for the rest of your life and seeing that possibility taken away... I definitely wove that sense of unrest and nervousness into Nick's character.\"\n\nAsked how she can write so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, \"I'm kind of part guy myself.\" When she needs to understand something about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend. Flynn's autobiographical essay \"I Was Not a Nice Little Girl...\" invites readers to believe she took inspiration for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like \"stunning ants and feeding them to spiders.\" A favourite indoor game called \"Mean Aunt Rosie\" allowed Flynn to cast herself as a \"witchy caregiver\" who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.\n\nFlynn identified Zoë Heller's \"Notes on a Scandal\" and Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" as influences on her writing and, in particular, on the plot and themes of \"Gone Girl\". Flynn said she admired the \"ominous\" ending of \"Notes on a Scandal\" and the pathology of a bad marriage from \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\". For the conclusion of \"Gone Girl\", Flynn drew from \"Rosemary's Baby\": \"I love that it just ends with, you know, 'Hey, the devil's in the world, and guess what? Mom kind of likes him!'\" she said.\n\nFlynn also says she is influenced by the mystery writers Laura Lippman, Karin Slaughter, George Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane, and Harlan Coben. However, she tries not to read any one genre exclusively, and she also admires Joyce Carol Oates, Margaret Atwood, T.C. Boyle, and Arthur Phillips, who are better known as realistic contemporary writers.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" is also the title of a Lew Archer story, in the 1955 collection \"The Name is Archer\", by Ross Macdonald, who Flynn has also cited as a favorite author.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" is an example of mystery, suspense, and crime genres. A \"Reader's Digest\" review, for instance, notes that the book is \"more than just a crime novel\". The review goes on to describe \"Gone Girl\" as a \"masterful psychological thriller\" which offers \"an astute and thought-provoking look into two complex personalities\". A \"Chicago Tribune\" review notes that \"Gone Girl\" uses many of the devices common to thrillers—a cast of viable suspects, unfolding secrets, and red herrings. However, the novel does more with these devices than the thriller genre requires: \"While serving their usual functions, they also do much more, launching us into an unnerving dissection of the fallout of failed dreams.\"\n\nIn her \"New York Times\" review, Janet Maslin also writes that the elements of \"Gone Girl\" that \"sound like standard-issue crime story machinations\" are not, because both narrators are also consummate liars and cannot be trusted to convey the truth about their own stories. Salon.com writes that \"Gone Girl\" has literary features that enhance the crime genre features, adding that Flynn is \"kicking the genre into high gear.\" Flynn herself says that, in writing \"Gone Girl\", she employed the mystery genre as a \"thru-lane\" to explore what she was really interested in: relationships.\n\n\"Gone Girl's\" themes include dishonesty, the devious media, the unhappiness that comes with a troubled economy, and the superficial nature of appearance. The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: \"marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, yet at the same time the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But your spouse never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and let yourself unwind a bit.\"\n\nAn underlying theme is the brief undertone of feminism, most notably represented in Amy's 'Cool Girl' speech. For some, it is in this monologue that the otherwise despised Amazing Amy emerges as an unlikely heroine of sorts; flying the flag for women who refuse to succumb to the pressure to morph into the male's ideal. Flynn is a self-identified feminist and has stated that Amy's \"just pragmatically evil\" character and non-conformity to the traditional perception of women as innately good characters are the embodiment of feminism, which she defined as \"the ability to have women who are bad characters.\"\n\nSeveral reviews have also noted how well \"Gone Girl\" shows the tricky nature of media representation. Nick seems guilty due to media coverage before a trial occurs. Salon.com notes that \"Flynn, a former staff writer for \"Entertainment Weekly\", is especially good on the infiltration of the media into every aspect of the missing-person investigation, from Nick's cop-show-based awareness that the husband is always the primary suspect to a raving tabloid-TV Fury, who is out to avenge all wronged women and obviously patterned on Nancy Grace.\" Entertainment writer Jeff Giles notes that the novel also plays on reader expectations that the husband will be the murderer, expectations that have also been shaped by the media, writing, \"The first half of \"Gone Girl\" is a nimble, caustic riff on our Nancy Grace culture and the way in which 'The butler did it' has morphed into 'The husband did it.'\" A \"New York Daily News\" review also notes the novel's interest in how quickly a husband can be convicted in the media: \"In a media society informed by Nancy Grace, when a wife goes missing, the husband murdered her. There’s no need for a body to arrive at a verdict.\" A \"San Francisco Chronicle\" review also notes the book's recurring commentary on media influence: \"Flynn pokes smart fun at cable news, our collective obsession with social media and reality TV.\"\n\nFlynn has also said that she wanted this novel to capture the sense of bankruptcy that both individuals and communities feel when the economy spirals. Not only have both her main characters lost their jobs, they have also moved to a town that is blighted by unsold houses and failed businesses. \"I wanted the whole thing to feel bankrupt ... I wanted it to really feel like a marriage that had been hollowed out in a city that had been hollowed out and a country that was increasingly hollowed out,\" said Flynn.\n\nAmy's \"Cool Girl\" speech and the vital task of Nick's performing for his media spectators, highlight the importance of establishing and maintaining appearances, however false. Flynn said this: \"The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn’t keep it up, so they destroy each other\". Amy creates her plan to frame her husband when Nick fails to maintain the false image Amy married, which she feels she is owed for keeping her side of the bargain by pretending to be his \"cool girl\" fantasy. She only returns to him after he gives a convincing public performance in the role of perfect husband. However, it is not his sincerity she is attracted to, she knows he is putting on an act, but the appearance of it. Amy views Nick as her ideal husband in the end because she knows he must appear to be her ideal husband, permanently, due to her blackmail and the risk of public condemnation. In exchange, she will appear as an ideal wife and mother, a trade Nick accepts. Both prefer the appearance the other projects over the reality of the person they married.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" was #1 on the \"New York Times\" Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list for eight weeks. It was also twenty-six weeks on National Public Radio's hardcover fiction bestseller list. Culture writer Dave Itzkoff wrote that the novel was, excepting books in the \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy, the biggest literary phenomenon of 2012. By the end of its first year in publication, \"Gone Girl\" had sold over two million copies in print and digital editions, according to the book's publisher.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" has been widely praised in numerous publications including the \"New Yorker, The New York Times, Time, Publishers Weekly, Entertainment Weekly, Chatelaine, People,\" and \"USA Today\". Reviewers express admiration for the novel's suspense, a plot twist involving an unreliable narrator, its psychological dimension, and its examination of a marriage that has become corrosive. \"Entertainment Weekly\" describes it as \"an ingenious and viperish thriller.\" \"The New Yorker\" describes it as a \"mostly well-crafted novel,\" praising its depiction of an \"unraveling\" marriage and a \"recession-hit Midwest,\" while finding its conclusion somewhat \"outlandish.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" likens Gillian Flynn to acclaimed suspense novelist Patricia Highsmith. \"Gone Girl\", the \"Times\" goes on to say, is Flynn's \"dazzling breakthrough,\" adding that the novel is \"wily, mercurial, subtly layered and populated by characters so well imagined that they’re hard to part with.\" A \"USA Today\" review focuses on bookseller enthusiasm for the book, quoting a Jackson, Mississippi store manager saying, \"It will make your head spin off.\" \"People Magazine\"'s review found the novel \"a delectable summer read\" that burrows \"deep into the murkiest corners of the human psyche.\" A \"Chatelaine\" review commends the novel's suspense, its intricately detailed plot and the way it keeps the reader \"unnervingly off balance.\"\n\nMany reviewers have noted the difficulty of writing about \"Gone Girl\", because so little in the first half of the novel is what it seems to be. In his \"Time\" review, Lev Grossman describes the novel as a \"house of mirrors.\" He also writes \"Its content may be postmodern, but it takes the form of a thoroughbred thriller about the nature of identity and the terrible secrets that can survive and thrive in even the most intimate relationships.\"\n\nIn an article in Salon.com, Laura Miller laments that \"Gone Girl\" was conspicuously absent from the winning ranks of prestigious literary awards, like the National Book Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize. The same article argues that \"Gone Girl\" was snubbed because it belongs to the mystery genre. Judges awarding top literary prizes \"have all refrained from honoring any title published within the major genres.\" \"Gone Girl\" was chosen for the inaugural Salon What To Read Awards (2012). The novel has also been short-listed for the Women's Prize for Fiction. Natasha Walter, one of the Women's Prize judges in 2013, told the \"Independent\" that there was considerable debate amongst the judges about the inclusion of \"Gone Girl\" in the finalists' circle. Walter indicated that crime fiction is often \"overlooked\" by those in a position to make literary commendations.\n\n\"Gone Girl\" was recorded as a Random House audiobook, featuring the voices of Julia Whelan as Amy Dunne and Kirby Heyborne as Nick Dunne. It is an unabridged edition on fifteen compact discs and takes 19.25 hours to hear in its entirety.\n\nAmerican actress Reese Witherspoon's film production company and 20th Century Fox bought the screen rights to \"Gone Girl\", for which they paid US$1.5 million. The novel's author Gillian Flynn was engaged to write the screenplay. Witherspoon produced the film version along with Leslie Dixon, Bruna Papandrea, and Ceán Chaffin. Witherspoon was drawn to the script because of its strong female character and its use of multiple perspectives and non-linear structure. In May 2013, it was announced that David Fincher was brought on as director, with Ben Affleck cast as Nick and Rosamund Pike in the role of Amy. New Regency and Fox agreed to co-finance the film. The film was released October 3, 2014.\n"}
{"id": "839209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839209", "title": "Gorani language", "text": "Gorani language\n\nGorani (also Gurani) is an Indo-Iranian language of the Zaza-Gorani subroup of the Northwestern Iranian languages.\nHawrami (or Hewrami) is an alternate name of Gorani. It has similarities with other languages of the Zaza-Gorani subgroup of the Northwestern Iranian languages. Gorani is most similar to languages like Zazaki, Shabaki, Bajelani and Sarli.\n\nGorani or Hawrami is spoken in the southwestern corner of province of Kurdistan and northwestern corner of province of Kermanshah in Iran, and in parts of the Halabja region in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Hawraman mountains between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe oldest literary documents in these related languages, or dialects, are written in Gorani.\n\nMany Gorani speakers belong to the religious grouping Yarsanism, with a large number of religious documents written in Gorani.\n\nGorani was once an important literary language in the parts of Western Iran but has since been replaced by Sorani. In the 19th century, Gorani as a language was slowly replaced by Sorani in several cities, both in Iran and Iraq. Today, Sorani is the primary language spoken in cities including Kirkuk, Meriwan, and Halabja, which are still considered part of the greater Goran region.\n\nKurds and Gorani speakers themselves tend to consider Gorani as a dialect of Kurdish group of languages, which diverged off from Kurmanji speakers, Badhini and Sorani alike, at around 100 BCE. The differences between the Zaza–Gorani languages and the Kurdish languages are too many, and are therefore far too great by any standard linguistic criteria to warrant classification as dialects of the same languages.\n\nThe name Goran appears to be of Indo-Iranian origin. The name may be derived from the old Avestan word, \"gairi\", which means mountain. The word Gorani refers to inhabitants of the mountains or highlanders as the suffix \"-i\" means \"from\". The word has been used to describe mountainous regions and the regions' communities in modern Kurdish literary texts. In this sense Gorani has the same etymological background as the Gorani language spoken in the Balkans, which derives from a Slavic word 'gora' also meaning mountainous region. \n\nThe name Horami is believed by some scholars to be derived from God's name in Avestan, Ahura Mazda.\n\nUnder the independent rulers of Ardalan (9th–14th / 14th–19th century), with their capital latterly at Sanandaj, Gorani became the vehicle of a considerable corpus of poetry. Gorani was and remains the first language of the scriptures of the Ahl-e Haqq sect, or Yarsanism, centered on Gahvara. Prose works, in contrast, are hardly known. The structure of Gorani verse is very simple and monotonous. It consists almost entirely of stanzas of two rhyming half-verses of ten syllables each, with no regard to the quantity of syllables.\n\nAn example:\nدیمای حمد ذات جهان آفرین\n\n\"After praise of the Being who created the world\n\nیا وام پی تعریف شای خاور زمین\n\nI have reached a description of the King of the Land of the East.\n\nNames of forty classical poets writing in Gurani are known, but the details of the lives and dates are unknown for the most part. Perhaps the earliest writer is Mala Parisha, author of a masnavi of 500 lines on the Shi'ite faith who is reported to have lived around 1398–99. Other poets are known from the 17th–19th centuries and include Mahzuni, Shaikh Mostafa Takhti, Khana Qubadi, Yusuf Zaka, and Ahmab Beg Komashi. One of the last great poets to complete a book of poems (divan) in Gurani is Mala Abd-al Rahm of Tawa-Goz south of Halabja.\n\nThere exist also a dozen or more long epic or romantic masnavis, mostly translated by anonymous writers from Persian literature including: Bijan and Manijeh, Khurshid-i Khawar, Khosrow and Shirin, Layla and Majnun, Shirin and Farhad, Haft Khwan-i Rostam and Sultan Jumjuma. Manuscripts of these works are currently preserved in the national libraries of Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nSome Gorani literary works:\n\nHawrami (هەورامی; \"Hewramî\") also known as Avromani, Awromani or Owrami, is one of the main groups of dialects of the Gorani language, and is regarded as the most archaic of the Gorani group. It is mostly spoken in the Hawraman region, a mountainous region located in western Iran (Iranian Kurdistan) and northeastern Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan). The key cities of this region are Pawe in Iran and Halabja in Iraq. Hawrami is sometimes called Auramani or Horami by people foreign to the region.\n\nThere are also large communities of people of Ahl-e Haqq in some regions of Iranian Azerbaijan. The town of Ilkhichi (İlxıçı), which is located 87 km south west of Tabriz is almost entirely populated by Yâresânis. But they are ethnically Turks. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in Iranian Kurdistan. Both the Dersim \"(Zazaki)\" people and the Gorani people, adhere to a form of \"Yazdanism. \"These people are called under the various names, such as Ali-Ilahis and Ahl-e Haqq. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in all parts of Kurdistan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13972", "title": "Hungarian language", "text": "Hungarian language\n\nHungarian () is a Finno-Ugric language spoken in Hungary and several neighbouring countries. It is the official language of Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of Hungarians in the countries that today make up Slovakia, western Ukraine (Subcarpathia), central and western Romania (Transylvania), northern Serbia (Vojvodina), northern Croatia, and northern Slovenia (Mur region). It is also spoken by Hungarian diaspora communities worldwide, especially in North America (particularly the United States and Canada) and in Israel. Like Finnish and Estonian, Hungarian belongs to the Uralic language family.\n\nHungarian is a member of the Uralic language family. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717, but the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to an Ugric branch within Uralic/Finno-Ugric, along with the Mansi and Khanty languages of western Siberia (Khanty–Mansia region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group. When the Samoyed languages were determined to be part of the family, it was thought at first that Finnic and Ugric (Finno-Ugric) were closer to each other than to the Samoyed branch of the family, but that now is frequently questioned.\n\nThe name of Hungary could be a result of regular sound changes of \"Ungrian/Ugrian\", and the fact that the Eastern Slavs referred to Hungarians as \"Ǫgry/Ǫgrove\" (sg. \"Ǫgrinŭ\") seemed to confirm that. Current literature favors the hypothesis that it comes from the name of the Turkic tribe Onogur (which means \"ten arrows\" or \"ten tribes\").\n\nThere are numerous regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and the other Ugric languages. For example, Hungarian corresponds to Khanty in certain positions, and Hungarian corresponds to Khanty , while Hungarian final corresponds to Khanty final . For example, Hungarian \"ház\" \"house\" vs. Khanty \"xot\" \"house\", and Hungarian \"száz\" \"hundred\" vs. Khanty \"sot\" \"hundred\". The distance between the Ugric and Finnic languages is greater, but the correspondences are also regular.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian. Following an academic debate known as \"Az ugor-török háború\" (\"the Ugric-Turkic battle\"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, foremost based on work by the German linguist .\n\nThe traditional view holds that the Hungarian language diverged from its Ugric relatives in the first half of the 1st millennium, in western Siberia east of the southern Urals. The Hungarians gradually changed their lifestyle from being settled hunters to being nomadic pastoralists, probably as a result of early contacts with Iranian nomads (Scythians and Sarmatians). In Hungarian, Iranian loanwords date back to the time immediately following the breakup of Ugric and probably span well over a millennium. Among these include \"tehén\" ‘cow’ (cf. Avestan \"dhaénu\"); \"tíz\" ‘ten’ (cf. Avestan \"dasa\"); \"tej\" ‘milk’ (cf. Persian \"dáje\" ‘wet nurse’); and \"nád\" ‘reed’ (from late Middle Iranian; cf. Middle Persian \"nāy\").\n\nArchaeological evidence from present day southern Bashkortostan confirms the existence of Hungarian settlements between the Volga River and Ural Mountains. \nThe Onogurs (and Bulgars) later had a great influence on the language, especially between the 5th and 9th centuries. This layer of Turkic loans is large and varied (\"e.g.\", \"szó\" ‘word’, from Turkic; \"daru\" ‘crane’, from the related Permic languages), and includes words borrowed from Oghur Turkic; \"e.g.\", \"borjú\" ‘calf’ (cf. Chuvash \"păru\", \"părăv\" vs. Turkish \"buzağı\"); \"dél\" ‘noon; south’ (cf. Chuvash \"tĕl\" vs. Turkish dial. \"düš\"). Many words related to agriculture, state administration and even family relationships show evidence of such backgrounds. Hungarian syntax and grammar were not influenced in a similarly dramatic way over these three centuries.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin, the language came into contact with a variety of speech communities, among them Slavic, Turkic, and German. Turkic loans from this period come mainly from the Pechenegs and Cumanians, who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th centuries; \"e.g.\", \"koboz\" ‘cobza’ (cf. Turkish \"kopuz\" ‘lute’); \"komondor\" ‘mop dog’ (< *\"kumandur\" < \"Cuman\"). Hungarian borrowed many words from neighbouring Slavic languages; \"e.g.\", \"tégla\" ‘brick’; \"mák\" ‘poppy’; \"karácsony\" ‘Christmas’). These languages in turn borrowed words from Hungarian; \"e.g.\", Serbo-Croatian \"ašov\" from Hung \"ásó\" ‘spade’. Approximately 1.6 percent of the Romanian lexicon is of Hungarian origin.\n\nHungarian historian and archaeologist Gyula László claims that geological data from pollen analysis seems to contradict the placing of the ancient Hungarian homeland near the Urals.\n\nThere have been attempts, dismissed by mainstream linguists as pseudoscientific comparisons, to show that Hungarian is related to other languages, such as Hebrew, Hunnic, Sumerian, Egyptian, Etruscan, Basque, Persian, Pelasgian, Greek, Chinese, Sanskrit, English, Tibetan, Magar, Quechua, Armenian, Japanese, and at least 40 other languages.\n\nToday the consensus among linguists is that Hungarian is a member of the Uralic family of languages.\n\nFor many years, however, it was a matter of dispute whether Hungarian was a Finno-Ugric/Uralic language or more closely related to the Turkic languages (a controversy known as the \"Ugric–Turkish war\")—or whether indeed both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a superfamily of Ural–Altaic languages. Hungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned animal husbandry techniques from the Turkic Chuvash people, as a high proportion of words specific to agriculture and livestock are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian burial customs. Furthermore, all Ugric languages, not only Hungarian, feature Turkic loanwords related to horse riding.\n\nThe first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly personal name and place names, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in Old Hungarian script have survived, as wood, the medium of writing in use at the time, was perishable.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary was founded in 1000 by Stephen I. The country became a Western-styled Christian (Roman Catholic) state, with Latin script replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany from 1055, intermingled with Latin text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer, which dates to the 1190s. Although the orthography of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.\n\nA more extensive body of Hungarian literature arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian religious poetry is the 14th-century \"Lamentations of Mary\". The first Bible translation was the Hussite Bible in the 1430s.\n\nThe standard language lost its diphthongs, and several postpositions transformed into suffixes, including \"reá\" \"onto\" (the phrase \"utu rea \"onto the way\" found in the 1055 text would later become \"útra). There were also changes in the system of vowel harmony. At one time, Hungarian used six verb tenses. Today, only two are commonly used (present and past); the future is formed with an auxiliary verb and is usually not counted as a separate tense.\n\nIn 1533, Kraków printer Benedek Komjáti published the first Hungarian-language book set in movable type, a translation of the letters of Saint Paul entitled \"Az zenth Paal leueley magyar nyeluen\" (modern orthography: \"Az Szent Pál levelei magyar nyelven\").\n\nBy the 17th century, the language already closely resembled its present-day form, although two of the past tenses remained in use. German, Italian and French loans also began to appear. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the period of Ottoman rule (1541 to 1699).\n\nIn the 18th century a group of writers, most notably Ferenc Kazinczy, spearheaded a process of \"nyelvújítás\" (language revitalization). Some words were shortened (\"győzedelem\" > \"győzelem\", 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of dialectal words spread nationally (\"e.g.\", \"cselleng\" 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (\"dísz\", 'décor'); a wide range of expressions were coined using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw further standardization of the language, and differences between mutually comprehensible dialects gradually diminished.\n\nIn 1920, Hungary signed the Treaty of Trianon, losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.\n\nToday the language holds official status nationally in Hungary and regionally in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Austria and Slovenia.\n\nHungarian has about 13 million native speakers, of whom more than 9.8 million live in Hungary. According to the 2011 Hungarian census 9,896,333 people (99.6% of the total population) speak Hungarian, of whom 9,827,875 people (98.9%) speak it as a first language, while 68,458 people (0.7%) speak it as a second language. About 2.2 million speakers live in areas that were part of the Kingdom of Hungary before the Treaty of Trianon (1920). Of these, the largest group lives in Transylvania, the western half of present-day Romania, where there are approximately 1.25 million Hungarians. There are large Hungarian communities also in Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine, and Hungarians can also be found in Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia, as well as about a million additional people scattered in other parts of the world. For example, there are more than one hundred thousand Hungarian speakers in the Hungarian American community and 1.5 million with Hungarian ancestry in the United States.\n\nHungarian is the official language of Hungary, and thus an official language of the European Union. Hungarian is also one of the official languages of Vojvodina and an official language of three municipalities in Slovenia: Hodoš, Dobrovnik and Lendava, along with Slovene. Hungarian is officially recognized as a minority or regional language in Austria, Croatia, Romania, Zakarpattia in Ukraine, and Slovakia. In Romania it is a recognized minority language used at local level in communes, towns and municipalities with an ethnic Hungarian population of over 20%.\n\nThe dialects of Hungarian identified by Ethnologue are: Alföld, West Danube, Danube-Tisza, King's Pass Hungarian, Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Székely and West Hungarian. These dialects are, for the most part, mutually intelligible. The Hungarian Csángó dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in Bacău County in eastern Romania. The Csángó Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other Hungarian people, and they therefore preserved features that closely resemble earlier forms of Hungarian.\n\nHungarian has 14 vowel phonemes and 25 consonant phonemes. The vowel phonemes can be grouped as pairs of short and long vowels such as \"o\" and \"ó\". Most of the pairs have a similar pronunciation and vary significantly only in their duration. However, pairs \"a\"/\"á\" and \"e\"/\"é\" differ both in closedness and length.\n\nConsonant length is also distinctive in Hungarian. Most consonant phonemes can occur as geminates.\n\nThe sound voiced palatal plosive , written , sounds similar to 'd' in British English 'duty' (in fact, it is more similar to the Macedonian phoneme 'ѓ' as in 'ѓакон', \"deacon\", from \"diakon\"). It occurs in the name of the country, \"Magyarország\" (Hungary), pronounced .\n\nA single 'r' is pronounced as an alveolar tap (\"akkora\" 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an alveolar trill (\"akkorra\" 'by that time'), like in Spanish.\n\nPrimary stress is always on the first syllable of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring Slovak and Czech. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: \"viszontlátásra\" (\"goodbye\") is pronounced . Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.\n\nHungarian, an agglutinative language, uses various affixes, mainly suffixes but also some prefixes and a circumfix, to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.\n\nHungarian uses vowel harmony to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.\n\nNouns have a large number of cases (between 18 and 35, depending on the definition), but they are generally formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (\"az alma\" 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix \"–t\" (\"az almát\" '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the 18 cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending –\"ból\"/\"–ből\" meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.\n\nPossession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as in English (Peter's apple becomes \"Péter almája\", literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with\"–k\" (\"az almák\" ‘the apples’), but after a numeral, the singular is used (\"két alma\" ‘two apples’, literally ‘two apple’; not \"*két almák\").\n\nUnlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and mostly postpositions, instead of prepositions.\n\nThere are two types of articles in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.\n\nAdjectives precede nouns (\"a piros alma\" 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (\"piros\" 'red'), comparative (\"pirosabb\" 'redder') and superlative (\"a legpirosabb\" 'the reddest').\n\nIf the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: \"a piros almák\" 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun: \"az almák pirosak\" 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): \"Melyik almát kéred? – A pirosat.\" 'Which apple would you like? – The red one'.\n\nVerbs are conjugated according to two tenses (past and present), three moods (indicative, conditional and imperative-subjunctive), two numbers (singular or plural), three persons (first, second and third) and definiteness.\n\nThe last feature is most characteristic: the definite conjugation is used with a transitive verb whose (direct) object is definite (\"Péter eszi az almát\". \"Peter eats the apple\".), but the indefinite conjugation either for a verb with an indefinite direct object (\"Péter eszik egy almát\". \"Peter eats an apple\".) or for a verb without an object. (\"Péter eszik\". \"Peter eats\".)\nSince conjugation expresses the person and number, personal pronouns are usually omitted except for emphasis.\n\nThe present tense is unmarked, and the past is formed by using the suffix –t or –tt: \"hall\" 'hears'; \"hallott\" 'heard', past. Future may be expressed with the present tense (usually with a word defining the time of the event: \"holnap\" 'tomorrow') or by using the auxiliary verb \"fog\" (similar to the English 'will'), followed by the infinitive.\n\nThe indicative mood and the conditional mood are used both in the present and the past tenses. The conditional past is expressed by using the conjugated past form and the auxiliary word \"volna \"(\"hallott volna\" 'would have heard')\".\" The imperative mood is used only in the present tense.\n\nVerbs have verbal prefixes, which are also known as coverbs. Most of them define direction of movement: \"lemegy\" \"goes down\", \"felmegy\" \"goes up\". Some verbal prefixes give an aspect to the verb, such as the prefix \"meg-\", which generally marks telicity.\n\nVowel harmony also plays a major role in verb conjugations. All Hungarian verb conjugations (as well as postpositions and possessive suffixes, for that matter) can be thought of as 'templates' into which vowels are inserted. Based on the nature of a verb's infinitive, which always ends in '-ni', one can create a generic 'template', which has mostly consonants. The vowels are then inserted into the 'template' according to the rules of vowel harmony, based on the categorization of the vowel in the verb root (front, back, rounded, unrounded).\n\nThe neutral word order is subject–verb–object (SVO). However, Hungarian, a topic-prominent language, has a word order that depends not only on syntax but also on the topic-comment structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).\n\nA Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.\n\nThe topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in \"\"Az almát János látja\".\" ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.\n\nThe focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, \"Én vagyok az apád\". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie \"The Empire Strikes Back\", the pronoun I (\"én\") is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.\n\nAlthough Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.\n\nHungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:\n\n\nThe four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of \"tegeződés\"\".\n\nSome anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the \"te\" (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop IKEA, whose web site and other publications address the customers in \"te\" form. When a news site asked IKEA—using the \"te\" form—why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer—using the \"ön\" form—that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France use the most polite (\"vous\") form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers. Telenor chose to communicate towards business customers in the polite \"ön\" form while all other customers are addressed in the less polite \"te\" form.\n\nGiving an accurate estimate for the total word count is difficult, since it is hard to define what to call \"a word\" in agglutinating languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To have a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements. The largest dictionaries from Hungarian to another language contain 120,000 words and phrases (but this may include redundant phrases as well, because of translation issues). The new desk lexicon of the Hungarian language contains 75,000 words and the Comprehensive Dictionary of Hungarian Language (to be published in 18 volumes in the next twenty years) will contain 110,000 words. The default Hungarian lexicon is usually estimated to comprise 60,000 to 100,000 words. (Independently of specific languages, speakers actively use at most 10,000 to 20,000 words, with an average intellectual using 25–30 thousand words.) However, all the Hungarian lexemes collected from technical texts, dialects etc. would all together add up to 1,000,000 words.\n\nParts of the Lexicon can be organized using word-bushes. (See an example on the right.) The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.\n\nThe basic vocabulary shares some hundreds word roots with other Uralic languages like Finnish, Estonian, Mansi and Khanty. Examples of such include the verb \"él\" 'live' (Finnish \"elää\"), the numbers \"kettő\" 'two', \"három\" 'three', \"négy\" 'four' (cf. Mansi китыг \"kitig\", хурум \"khurum\", нила \"nila\",\nFinnish \"kaksi, kolme, neljä\", Estonian \"kaks, kolm, neli\", ), as well as \"víz\" 'water', \"kéz\" 'hand', \"vér\" 'blood', \"fej\" 'head' (cf. Finnish and Estonian \"vesi, käsi, veri\", Finnish \"pää\", Estonian \"pea\" or \"pää\").\n\nWords for elementary kinship and nature are more Ugric, less r-Turkic and less Slavic. Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers & gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship & religion were, too.\n\nExcept for a few Latin and Greek loan-words, these differences are unnoticed even by native speakers; the words have been entirely adopted into the Hungarian lexicon. There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.\n\nAnother source differs in that loanwords in Hungarian are held to constitute about 45% of bases in the language. Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.\n\nWords can be compounds or derived. Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.\n\nCompounds have been present in the language since the Proto-Uralic era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.\n\nA good example is the word \"arc\":\n\nCompounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be \"subordinative\": the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a subjective one. There are objective, determinative, and adjunctive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:\n\nAccording to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more syllables long (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.\n\nOther compound words are \"coordinatives\": there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include word duplications (to emphasise the meaning; \"olykor-olykor\"\n'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: \"gizgaz\", where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix \"giz\" is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, \"hercehurca\" 'complex, obsolete procedures').\n\nA compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:\n\nHungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the Sun during the day in the Northern hemisphere.\n\n\nThere are two basic words for \"red\" in Hungarian: \"piros\" and \"vörös\" (variant: \"veres\"; compare with Estonian \"verev\" or Finnish \"punainen\"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English \"scarlet\" is of \"red\".) The word \"vörös\" is related to \"vér\", meaning \"blood\" (Finnish and Estonian \"veri\"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), \"vörös\" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between \"scarlet\" and \"red\". While many languages have multiple names for this colour, often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct \"folk colours\".\n\nHowever, the two words are also used independently of the above in collocations. \"Piros\" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while \"vörös\" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.\n\nWhen the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age. There is also a general word for \"sibling\": \"testvér\", from \"test\" \"body\" and \"vér\" \"blood\"; \"i.e.\", originating from the same body and blood.\n\nIn addition, there are separate prefixes for several ancestors and descendants:\n\nThe words for \"boy\" and \"girl\" are applied with possessive suffixes. Nevertheless, the terms are differentiated with different declension or lexemes:\n\n\"Fia\" is only used in this, irregular possessive form; it has no nominative on its own (see inalienable possession). However, the word \"fiú\" can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word \"(fiúja)\" will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.\n\nThe word \"fiú\" (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming \"fiaiéi\", adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:\n\n\nThe above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:\n\n\nWords of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see agglutinative language). They are not compound words—they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root (\"szent\", saint or holy).\nThere is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.\n\nThe English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably \"paprika\", from Serbo-Croatian \"papar\" \"pepper\" and the Hungarian diminutive \"-ka\". The most common however is \"coach\", from \"kocsi\", originally \"kocsi szekér\" \"car from/in the style of Kocs\". Others are:\n\n\nThe Hungarian language was originally written in right-to-left Old Hungarian runes, superficially similar in appearance to the better-known futhark runes but unrelated. When Stephen I of Hungary established the Kingdom of Hungary in the year 1000, the old system was gradually discarded in favour of the Latin alphabet and left-to-right order. Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practiced by some enthusiasts.\n\nModern Hungarian is written using an expanded Latin alphabet, and has a phonemic orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents \"(á, é, í, ó, ú)\" to represent long vowels, and umlauts (\"ö\" and \"ü\") and their long counterparts \"ő\" and \"ű\" to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) or is used for , and for . This is often due to the limitations of the Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page, but this code page is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both and .) Unicode includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the letter pairs , , and represent the palatal consonants , , and (a little like the \"d+y\" sounds in British \"\"du\"ke\" or American \"woul\"d y\"ou\") – a bit like saying \"d\" with the tongue pointing to the palate.\n\nHungarian uses for and for , which is the reverse of Polish usage. The letter is and is . These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter is also a \"single letter digraph\", but is pronounced like (English ), and appears mostly in old words. The letters and are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are \"madzag\" (\"string\"), \"edzeni\" (\"to train (athletically)\") and \"dzsungel\" (\"jungle\").\n\nSometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: házszám (\"street number\") = \"ház\" (\"house\") + \"szám\" (\"number\"), not an unintelligible \"házs\" + \"zám\".\n\nHungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, \"lenni\" (\"to be\"), \"hozzászólás\" (\"comment\"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: + = , e.g. \"művésszel\" (\"with an artist\"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, (\"with a bus\"):\n\nWhen the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: \"jegy\" + \"gyűrű\" = \"jegygyűrű\" (\"engagement/wedding ring\", \"jegy\" means \"sign\", \"mark\". The term \"jegyben lenni/járni\" means \"to be engaged\"; \"gyűrű\" means \"ring\").\n\nUsually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: \"tizennyolc\" (\"eighteen\") is a concatenation of \"tizen\" + \"nyolc\". There are doubling minimal pairs: \"tol\" (\"push\") vs. \"toll\" (\"feather\" or \"pen\").\n\nWhile to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and \"ly, j\" representing ).\n\nThe word order is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.\n\nThe Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern name order, in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the given name comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.\n\nFor clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary – where there is a significant Hungarian population – the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.\n\nFor an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist, the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\" was Teller Ede, but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as Edward Teller. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses \"András Schiff\" when abroad, not \"Andrew Schiff\" (in Hungarian \"Schiff András\"). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.\n\nIn modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:\n\n\nBefore the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also \"Hungarianised\": \"Goethe János Farkas\" (originally Johann Wolfgang Goethe). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including \"Verne Gyula\" (Jules Verne), \"Marx Károly\" (Karl Marx), \"Kolumbusz Kristóf\" (Christopher Columbus, note that it is also translated in English).\n\nSome native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as \"Luther Márton\" (Martin Luther), \"Husz János\" (Jan Hus), \"Kálvin János\" (John Calvin); just like the names of monarchs, for example the king of Spain, Juan Carlos I is referred to as \"I. János Károly\" or the queen of the UK, Elizabeth II is referred to as \"II. Erzsébet\".\n\nJapanese names, which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. \"Kuroszava Akira\" instead of Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThe Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)\n\nThe year and day are always written in Arabic numerals, followed by a full stop. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by Roman or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.\n\nHours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the 24-hour clock format, but in verbal (and written) communication 12-hour clock format can also be used. See below for usage examples.\n\nDate and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.\n\n\nDate separated by hyphen is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here – just like the version separated by full stops – leading zeros are in use.\n\n\nWhen only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only \"displaying\" time), these parts can be separated by a full stop (e.g. \"Találkozzunk 10.35-kor.\" – \"Let's meet at 10.35.\"), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in superscript (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. \"A találkozó 10-kor kezdődik.\" \"or\" \"A találkozó 10-kor kezdődik.\" – \"The meeting begins at 10.35.\").\n\nAlso, in verbal and written communication it is common to use \"délelőtt\" (literally \"before noon\") and \"délután\" (lit. \"after noon\") abbreviated as \"de.\" and \"du.\" respectively. Délelőtt and délután is said or written before the time, e.g. \"Délután 4 óra van.\" – \"It's 4 p.m.\". However e.g. \"délelőtt 5 óra\" (should mean \"5 a.m.\") or \"délután 10 óra\" (should mean \"10 p.m.\") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead \"hajnal\" (\"dawn\"), \"reggel\" (\"morning\"), \"este\" (\"evening\") and \"éjjel\" (\"night\") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says \"Reggel 6-kor ettem.\" – \"I had food at \"*morning\" 6.\", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says \"Hajnali 6-kor még aludtam.\" – \"I was still sleeping at \"*dawn\" 6.\"). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:\n\n\nAlthough address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:\n\nBudapest, Deák Ferenc tér 1. 1052\n\nSo the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:\n\nName of the recipient\nSettlement\nStreet address (up to door number if necessary)\n(HU-)postcode\n\n\"Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word. The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress. All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There have been numerous proposals to rationalize written English, notably by \n\nInventive spelling for children may be encouraged or discouraged by teachers and parents who may believe that expression is more important than accurate orthography or conversely that a failure to correct may lead to difficulty in communicating more complex ideas in later life.\n\nInventive spelling programs may also be known as \"words their way\" in some schools' curricula.\nCritics of inventive spelling have argued that inventive spelling does not produce superior writing skills.\n\nSamuel Orton pioneered the study of learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. where the subject is apt to confound the letter-order of words. He and his assistant Anna Gillingham, an educator and psychologist, evolved the Orton-Gillingham Approach to reading instruction which is language-based, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, cognitive, and flexible. The Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOEPE) lists about a dozen schools currently committed to this controversial method, which has evolved since about 1935.\n\nMore recently, Uta Frith, a developmental psychologist at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College, London, has published work concerning spelling difficulties and dyslexia.\n\nDyslexia, whether linked to complex spelling or not, may offer considerable potential for human development.\n\nWhether an individual accepts or rejects inventive spelling is a feature of that individual's theory of learning. The debate is closely linked with the debate over whole language literacy instruction and phonics instruction.\n\nThose who favor inventive spelling tend to believe in constructivism, a theoretical perspective on learning (an epistemology) grounded in postmodernism and holism. Constructivists believe that knowledge is created by individuals in a social context. Because knowledge is cultural, there are no right answers. In terms of inventive spelling, constructivists are likely to believe that the child is inventing spellings in accord with his or her understanding of language and print. These spellings are neither right nor wrong; they reflect the child's development as a speller.\n\nThose who oppose inventive spelling tend to be positivists or post-positivists. Positivists believe that there are correct answers that we can discover based upon empirical observation. They would argue that encouraging inventive spelling is not helpful because there are correct ways to spell that children should learn.\n\nPost-positivists believe that while we cannot know truth completely – our own biases and perspectives prevent that – we can \"approximate\" truth. Post-positivists might agree with constructivists that an inventive spelling does reflect a child's development but might also argue that there are socially accepted spellings and that children should know these well. This side of the debate was explored further in the book and short film \"The deliberate dumbing down of America\".\nAdvocates of inventive spelling focus on creativity when children are first learning to spell and write, feel this preserves self-esteem, and thus, feel creativity in spelling is most important. Opponents counter that creativity is a distraction when learning spelling for the first time, and that children ought to be taught accurate spelling as soon as possible so as not to have incorrect spellings become a habit and delay the learning of accurate spelling. The overwhelming view from parents is that children learn to spell more quickly and accurately if accurate spelling is the focus instead of creativity when learning words. Accuracy as the focus in spelling is the manner used in conventional teaching methods and was effectively universal prior to the implementation of 1970s school reform involving whole word literacy and \"new math\". \n\nPedagogical concepts are based on research studies of early literacy, e.g. by Emilia Ferreiro & Ana Teberosky, Maryann Manning and others. Children are encouraged to learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g. by writing letters to others. To write a word they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then to translate them into letters, e.g. \"k\", \"a\", \"t\" for the phonemes /k/, /æ/, and /t/. Empirical studies show that later orthographic development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings - as long as children from the beginning are confronted with \"book spellings\", too.\n\nTo use SIL International's inventive spelling program, there are several instructional principles, as follows: \n\nOne aspect of inventive spelling rarely discussed by its advocates is the toll it takes on teachers' time. Recent studies suggest that to be effective a spelling teacher also must correctly guess what words children meant to use when they invent spellings. The possible deductions are numerous and potentially complicated.\n\nWriting and reading are complex cognitive processes of encoding and decoding symbols, of which spelling forms only part. \"Look and say\" form an image of a word without spelling. Spelling training may require children to write out lists of words repeatedly, or engage in competitive spelling bee tests. Such methods of instruction do not tend to improve students' understanding of the relationship between spelling and pronunciation on any words except those prescribed.\n\nInstruction that emphasizes conventional spelling focuses on the phonics patterns and rules in English which are anyway intrinsically weak because of the complexity of the history of the English language. For example, children can be taught that when they hear the sound at the end of a one-syllable word where a short vowel precedes the sound, the sound will be spelled \"ck\" (as in \"stack\", \"wreck\", \"stick\", \"rock\", and \"stuck\"). A similar pattern holds for the sound spelled \"dge\" (as in \"badge\", \"wedge\", \"bridge\", \"lodge\", and \"budge\") and the sound spelling \"tch\".\n\nThe same is also applicable for the process of learning acronyms. It is acceptable to use the inventive spelling of GBOL or \"Jeebol\" which can in turn be written as \"Jeeball\".\n\nOnce children learn these phonics patterns, they can apply them to words. When children make errors, the teacher does not merely tell them they are wrong; the teacher, to the extent possible, returns the child's attention to the relevant rule or pattern.\n\nThere are also sight words that do not follow patterns; children need to memorize conventional spellings for these words, such as \"who\".\n\nWhether teachers encourage children to use inventive spellings or not, analyzing them has several key advantages:\n\nFor those teachers who emphasize constructivist, inventive spellings, there are further advantages:\n\nThe above two suppositions on the benefits of inventive spelling have not been empirically verified and are not generally accepted by neurolinguists, who study the natural learning process of spoken language and have recently determined that reading and spelling are not \"hard-wired\", natural processes.\n\nPermitting or encouraging children to spell inventively has some costs.\n\n"}

They took it with them to a number of other countries. In Scotland and the Isle of Man it gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx. It was later carried abroad to other more distant lands in both hemispheres.\n\nIn the course of the 19th century English became the dominant vernacular of Ireland, and Irish has since been spoken only by a small minority of the population. Irish remains the vehicle of a separate cultural, literary and historical experience, emphasised by purely linguistic differences, since (like other Celtic languages) it is distinctive in structure and vocabulary. Irish was the language that a large number of emigrants took with them from the 17th century (when large-scale emigration, forced or otherwise, became noticeable) to the 19th century.\n\nThe Irish diaspora mainly settled in English-speaking countries, chiefly Britain and North America. In some instances the Irish language was retained for several generations. Argentina was the only non-English-speaking country to which the Irish went in large numbers, and those emigrants came in the 19th century from areas where Irish was already in retreat.\n\nAn interest in the language has persisted among a minority in the diaspora countries, and even in countries where there was never a significant Irish presence. This has been shown in the founding of language classes (including some at tertiary level), in the use of the Internet, and in contributions to journalism and literature.\n\nIrish speakers of all social classes were to be found in early modern Britain. Irish beggars were common in 16th century England, and from the late 16th century many unskilled Irish labourers settled in Liverpool, Bristol and London. Aristocratic Irish speakers included the Nugent brothers, members of Ireland's \"Old English\" community: Christopher, 9th Baron Delvin, who wrote an Irish-language primer for Elizabeth I, and William, an Irish language poet who is known to have been at Oxford in 1571.\nIrish speakers were among the Royalist contingents brought over from Ireland during the English Civil War. Language and cultural differences were partly responsible for the great hostility they encountered in England. Among them were troops commanded by Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, who took them with him when he later sided with Parliament.\n\nLarge-scale Irish immigration, including many Irish speakers, began with the building of canals from the 1780s and of railways in the nineteenth century. More Irish settled in industrial towns in Lancashire in the late eighteenth century than in any other county. Many Irish were attracted to Birmingham in the mid-1820s by rapid industrial expansion. The city had large households of Irish speakers, often from the same parts of Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Sligo. In Manchester a sixth of the family heads were Irish by 1835. By the 1830s Irish speakers were to be found in Manchester, Glasgow and the larger towns of South Wales. Irish speakers from Roscommon, Galway and Mayo were also to be found in Stafford from the 1830s.\n\nThe Great Famine of the 1840s brought an influx of Irish speakers to England, Wales and Scotland. Many arrived from such counties as Mayo, Cork, Waterford and Limerick to Liverpool, Bristol, and the towns of South Wales and Lancashire, and often moved on to London. Navvies found work on the South Wales Railway. There are reports of Irish-speaking communities in some quarters of Liverpool in the Famine years (1845–52). Irish speakers from Munster were common among London immigrants, with many women speaking little or no English. Around 100,000 Irish had arrived in London by 1851.\n\nThe Gaelic Revival in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century led to formation of branches of the Gaelic League abroad, including British cities. There were three branches of the Gaelic League in Glasgow by 1902 and a branch was also founded in Manchester.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War there were a large number of Irish working in Britain in the construction industry and as nurses. Many of them, both in provincial towns and in London, were Irish speakers from Conamara and other Gaeltacht areas, and Irish was commonly heard on building sites and in dance halls.\n\nIrish immigrants were a notable element of London life from the early seventeenth century. They engaged in seasonal labour and street selling, and became common around St Giles in the Fields during the eighteenth century, being prominent among the London poor. Many of them were discharged soldiers. The Old Bailey trial records give a glimpse of the use of Irish in London backstreets, including an instance where a court interpreter was required (1768).\n\nThe first Irish colony was in St Giles in the Fields and Seven Dials. By the early nineteenth century Irish communities existed in Whitechapel, Saffron Hill, Poplar and Southwark, and especially in Marylebone. Typical occupations were hawking and costermongering. Henry Mayhew estimated in the 1850s that around 10,000 Irish men and women were so employed. The writer and linguist George Borrow gives an account (1851) of his father venturing into the Irish-speaking slums of London in the early years of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe use of the language was affected by a decline in the number of immigrants. By the middle of the nineteenth century the Irish-born numbered around 109,000 individuals (4.5% of Londoners). By 1861 their number had fallen to 107,000, in 1871 to 91,000, and in 1901 to 60,000.\n\nThe Gaelic League was active in London as elsewhere. The London branch had a number of notable London Irish figures as members, and it was a pioneer in the publication of Irish-language material.\n\nThe current estimate of fluent Irish speakers permanently resident in Britain is 9,000.\n\nThe Gaelic League retains a presence in Britain (the current Glasgow branch was founded in 1895), and the Irish-language organization Coláiste na nGael and its allies run language classes and other events all over Britain. The areas concerned include London, Essex, Leicestershire and Somerset. There is an active Irish language scene in Manchester with two groups, Conradh na Gaeilge (Manchester branch) and the Manchester Irish Language Group, who have organised an annual arts festival since 2007. The British Association for Irish Studies (established 1985) aims to support Irish cultural activities and the study of Ireland in Britain. This includes promotion of the Irish language.\n\nIrish people brought the language with them to North America as early as the 17th century (when it is first mentioned). In the 18th century it had many speakers in Pennsylvania. Immigration from Irish-speaking counties to America was strong throughout the 19th century, particularly after the Famine, and many manuscripts in Irish came with the immigrants.\n\n1881 saw the founding of “ ”, the first newspaper anywhere which was largely in Irish. It continued to be published into the 20th century, and now has an on-line successor in \"An Gael\". In addition to \"An Gaodhal\", many Irish immigrant newspapers in the English language in the 19th and 20th century added Irish language columns. This could most recently be seen with the weekly articles of Barra Ó Donnabháin in New York's Irish Echo.\n\nIrish has retained some cultural importance in the northeast United States. According to the 2000 Census, 25,661 people in the U.S. spoke Irish at home. The 2005 Census reports 18,815.\n\nThe Irish language was introduced into Newfoundland in the late 17th century and was widely spoken there up until the early 20th century. It remains the only place outside Europe that can claim a unique Irish name (\"Talamh an Éisc\", meaning \"Land of the Fish\").\n\nIn 2007 a number of Canadian speakers founded the first officially designated \"Gaeltacht\" outside Ireland in an area near Kingston, Ontario (see main article Permanent North American Gaeltacht). Despite its designation, the area has no permanent Irish-speaking inhabitants. The site (named \"Gaeltacht Bhaile na hÉireann\") is located in Tamworth, Ontario, and is to be a retreat centre for Irish-speaking Canadians and Americans.\n\nThe Irish Government provides funding for suitably qualified Irish speakers to travel to Canada and the United States to teach the language at universities. This program has been coordinated by the Fulbright Commission in the United States and the Ireland Canada University Foundation in Canada.\n\nA number of North American universities have full-time lecturers in Modern Irish. These include Boston College, Harvard University, Lehman College-CUNY, New York University, Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Concordia University in Montreal, Elms College, and most notably the University of Notre Dame. Two of these institutions offer undergraduate degrees with advanced Irish language coursework, the University of Notre Dame with a BA in Irish Language and Literature and Lehman College-CUNY with a BA in Comparative Literature. Irish language courses are also offered at St Michael's College in the University of Toronto and at Memorial University in Newfoundland.\n\nThe Irish language reached Australia in 1788, along with English. Irish, when used by convicts in the early colonial period, was seen as a language of covert opposition, and was therefore viewed with suspicion by colonial authorities.\n\nThe Irish constituted a larger proportion of the European population than in any other British colony, and there has been debate about the extent to which Irish was used in Australia. The historian Patrick O’Farrell argued that the language was soon discarded; other historians, including Dymphna Lonergan and Val Noone, have argued that its use was widespread among the first generation, with some transmission to the second and occasional evidence of literacy. Most Irish immigrants came from counties in the west and south-west where Irish was strong (e.g. County Clare and County Galway). It has been argued that at least half the approximately 150,000 Irish emigrants to Victoria in the 19th century spoke Irish, helping to make Irish the most widely used European language in Australia after English.\n\nEnglish was essential to the Irish for their integration into public life. Irish, however, retained some cultural and symbolic importance, and the Gaelic revival was reflected in Australia in the work of local students and scholars. The language was taught in several Catholic schools in Melbourne in the 1920s, and a bilingual magazine called \"An Gael\" was published. In the following years a small group of enthusiasts in the major cities continued to cultivate the language.\n\nIn the 1970s there was a more general renewal of interest, supported by both local and immigrant activists. The Irish National Association, with support from the Sydney branch of the Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaeilge), ran free classes in Sydney from the 1960s through to 2007, when the language group became independent. In 1993 Máirtín Ó Dubhlaigh, a Sydney-based Irish speaker, founded the first Irish language summer school, Scoil Samhraidh na hAstráile. This brought together for the first time Irish speakers and teachers from all over the country. The language also attracted some wider public attention.\n\nThere is presently a network of Irish learners and users spread out across the country. The primary organised groups are the Irish Language Association of Australia (Cumann Gaeilge na hAstráile), Sydney Irish School and the Canberra Irish Language Association (Cumann Gaeilge Canberra). Multiple day courses are available twice a year in the states of Victoria and New South Wales. The association has won several prestigious prizes (the last in 2009 in a global competition run by Glór na nGael and sponsored by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs).\n\nThe 2011 census indicated that 1,895 people used Irish as a household language in Australia. This marks an increase from the 2001 census, which gave a figure of 828. The census does not count those who use Irish or other languages outside the household context.\n\nThe Department of Celtic Studies at the University of Sydney offers courses in Modern Irish linguistics, Old Irish and Modern Irish language. The University of Melbourne houses a valuable collection of nineteenth and early twentieth century books and manuscripts in Irish, \n\nAustralians contribute fiction and journalism to Irish-language magazines, both in print and on-line. There is also a widely distributed electronic newsletter in Irish called \"An Lúibín\".\n\nIrish migration to New Zealand was strongest in the 1840s, the 1860s (at the time of the gold rush) and the 1870s. These immigrants arrived at a time when the language was still widely spoken in Ireland, particularly in the south-west and west. In the 1840s the New Zealand Irish included many discharged soldiers: over half those released in Auckland (the capital) in the period 1845-1846 were Irish, as were 56.8% of those released in the 1860s. There was, however, a fall in Irish immigration from the 1880s. At first the Irish clustered in certain occupations, with single women in domestic service and men working as navvies or miners. By the 1930s Irish Catholics were to be found in government service, in transport and in the liquor industry, and assimilation was well advanced.\n\nThe use of Irish was influenced by immigrants' local origins, the time of their arrival and the degree to which a sense of Irishness survived. In 1894 the \"New Zealand Tablet\", a Catholic newspaper, published articles on the study of Irish. In 1895 it was resolved at a meeting in the city of Dunedin that an Irish-language society on the lines of the Philo-Celtic Society of New York should be established in New Zealand. Gaelic League branches were formed in two New Zealand localities (Milton and Balclutha) and items in Irish were published by the Southern Cross of Invercargill. In 1903 Fr William Ganly, a native speaker from the Aran Islands prominent in Gaelic Revival circles in Melbourne, visited Milton, where he met a large number of Irish speakers.\n\nThe dwindling of Irish immigration, the decay of the Gaeltacht in Ireland and the passing of earlier generations were accompanied by a loss of the language. Interest is maintained among an activist minority.\n\nBetween 40,000 and 45,000 Irish emigrants went to Argentina in the 19th century. Of these, only about 20,000 settled in the country, the remainder returning to Ireland or re-emigrating to North America, Australia and other destinations. Of the 20,000 that remained, between 10,000 and 15,000 left no descendants or lost any link they had to the local Irish community. The nucleus of the Irish-Argentine community therefore consisted of only four to five thousand settlers.\n\nMany came from a quadrangle on the Longford/Westmeath border, its perimeter marked by Athlone, Edgeworthstown, Mullingar and Kilbeggan. It has been estimated that 43.35% of emigrants were from Westmeath, 14.57% from Longford and 15.51% from Wexford. Such migrants tended to be younger sons and daughters of the larger tenant farmers and leaseholders, but labourers also came, their fares paid by sheep-farmers seeking skilled shepherds.\n\nIrish census figures for the 19th century give an indication of the percentage of Irish speakers in the areas in question. Allowing for underestimation, it is clear that most immigrants would have been English speakers. Census figures for Westmeath, a major source of Argentinian immigrants, show the following percentages of Irish speakers: 17% in the period 1831-41, 12% in 1841-51, and 8% in 1851-61.\n\nIn the 1920s, there came a new wave of immigrants from Ireland, most being educated urban professionals who included a high proportion of Protestants. It is unlikely that there were many Irish speakers among them.\n\nThe persistence of an interest in Irish is indicated by the fact that the Buenos Aires branch of the Gaelic League was founded as early as 1899. It continued to be active for several decades thereafter, but evidence is lacking for organised attempts at language maintenance into the present day, though the Fahy Club in Buenos Aires continues to host Irish classes.\n\n"}

Though webcomics require a larger online community to gain widespread popularity through word-of-mouth, various webcomics pioneered the style of self-publishing in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In \"A History of Webcomics\", cartoonist T. Campbell stated that \"few strips from this period are remembered. But a few are notable early explorers of the art form.\"\n\nThe earliest known online comic was Eric Millikin's \"Witches and Stitches\", which he started uploading on CompuServe in 1985. By self-publishing on the internet, Millikin was able to share his work without having to worry over censorship and demographics. \"Witches and Stitches\" quickly rose to popularity, inspiring other artists to upload their works as well.\n\nJoe Ekaitis' \"T.H.E. Fox\" was a furry webcomic that started in 1986. Initially published on CompuServe, Ekaitis moved on to Q-Link and GEnie as the internet grew. Early strips consisted of one panel each and were drawn as pixel art on a Commodore 64 KoalaPad, first using KoalaPainter, then Advanced OCP Art Studio. \"T.H.E. Fox\" was eventually renamed \"Thadeus\" and started featuring regularly drawn strips, before Ekaitis stopped updating the comic in 1998.\n\nIn the early 1990s, cartoonists at various United States universities produced comics through various Internet protocols. During this period, it was unclear which systems would turn out to be the most successful. Hans Bjordahl, student at the University of Colorado at the time, started posting \"Where the Buffalo Roam\" on April 15, 1992 on Usenet, in GIF and PostScript format. Sharing the comic through the Internet, its readership extended through a few states. Even in 1995, cartoonist Dominic White published his comics \"The Internet Explorer Kit for the Macintosh\" and \"Slugs\" through Gopher rather than the World Wide Web, despite the latter rapidly gaining popularity.\n\nThe first strip of Stafford Huyler's \"NetBoy\" was uploaded on the World Wide Web in July 1993. Being described as an early example of nerd humor, the stick figure comic made frequent references to technical topics most people with an Internet connection at the time would have knowledge of. Huyler later started the spin-off comic \"U.Nox\", about system administrator Uri Noxen. Despite the small size of Huyler's early \"NetBoy\" comics (10 kilobytes), the server it was hosted on would crash when the strip got over six visits per second. In response to the webcomic's increasing popularity, Huyler built a stronger server himself. Despite these limitations, Huyler pioneered the concept of infinite canvas, uploading strips in shapes and sizes impossible in print.\n\nThe first strip of David Farley's \"Doctor Fun\" was uploaded on September 23, 1993. Campbell described \"Doctor Fun\" as the \"first regular web comic\", as \"NetBoy\" did not have a regular schedule during its first year. Mike Wean's \"Jax & Co.\" was first uploaded in 1994. Using Javascript, it was the first webcomic to implement a \"page turning\" interface that encourages readers to read the comic in order. Soon, this effect was recreated by simple HTML, such as with \"Argon Zark!\", which launched in June 1995 and is occasionally listed among the earliest comics to be published on the World Wide Web.\n\nMid-1994, the Finnish Comics Society launched a collection of webcomics by various authors, initially under the label \"NetComics\". In November 1994, Reinder Dijkhuis started publishing \"Rogues of Clwyd-Rhan\" on the World Wide Web. The two of these were the first known webcomic created outside of the United States. The same year, an artist going by the name Eerie created a webcomic on bulletin board systems using ANSI art, titled \"Inspector Dangerfuck\".\n\nWebcomics popular on the internet in January 1995 included \"NetBoy\", \"Aaron A. Aardvark\", and \"The Afterlife of Bob\". At this point, fans of traditional comics such as \"Calvin and Hobbes\" started sharing such copyrighted comic strips on the internet. By the end of 1995, there existed hundreds of webcomics, most of which were derived from college newspaper comics, and most were short-lived.\n\nThe first major webcomic portal, Big Panda, started in the second half of the 1990s. Big Panda hosted over 770 webcomics, including \"Sluggy Freelance\" and \"User Friendly\", which started in 1997. Big Panda's discontinuation resulted in the formation of Keenspot in 2000. In 1995, \"Dilbert\" became the first syndicated comic strip to be officially published through the Internet.\n\nThough the genre was popularized by \"PvP\", the first video game webcomic was Chris Morisson's \"Polymer City Chronicles\", which started being published on the World Wide Web in 1995. Three years later, in 1998, Jay Resop started the first sprite comic, \"Neglected Mario Characters\". In August 2000, Sean McGuinness started \"Twisted Kaiju Theater\", which is frequently cited to be the first photographic webcomic.\n\nExcluding traditional comic strips such as \"Calvin and Hobbes\" that were uploaded illegally, this is a timeline of cartoons that are known to have been posted on the Internet before 1995:\n"}

A number of fossils of the earliest hominins, particularly of the \"Australopithecines\", as well as some of the oldest known Olduwan stone artifacts, have been found at the site—all of late Miocene, the Pliocene, and the very early Pleistocene times, that is, about 5.6 million years ago (mya) to 2.5 mya. It is broadly thought that the divergence of the lines of the earliest humans (hominins) and of chimpanzees (hominids) was completed near the beginning of that time range, or sometime between seven and five mya. However, the larger community of scientists provide several estimates for periods of divergence that imply a greater range for this event, \"see\" CHLCA: human-chimpanzee split.\n\nA recent find of \"Australopithecus anamensis\" is dated to about 4.2 million years ago, which separates it only 200 thousand years from an earlier fossil of the more primitive \"Ardipithecus ramidus\" (at 4.4 million years ago). \"Australopithecus garhi\" fossils are dated as recent as the very early Pleistocene, or 2.5 mya; fossils of \"Homo erectus\" in the Daka member at the site (at 1 mya) and \"Homo sapiens idaltu\" (at 160 ka ago) are found in the middle and late Pleistocene. And patches of fire-baked clay, disputed as evidences of the controlled use of fire, are also found in that later period.\n\nSediments at the site were originally deposited in lakes or rivers, and carbonates found there contain low carbon isotope ratios. This information suggests that the environment of the Middle Awash was wet during the late Miocene, and that this currently arid region was occupied then by woodland or grassy woodland habitats. Fossil remains of other vertebrates found with the hominins, including the cane rat, further suggest such an environment. The region was the site of periodic volcanism, which probably created distinct ecological regions inhabited by different species of vertebrate animals.\n\nImportant hominin fossils found in the Middle Awash include:\n\n</div>\n\n"}

{"id": "6435170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6435170", "title": "Origin of Rashtrakuta Dynasty", "text": "Origin of Rashtrakuta Dynasty\n\nThe origin of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty has been a controversial topic and has been debated over the past decades by historians. The differing opinions mostly revolve around issues such as the home of the earliest ancestors of the medieval Rashtrakutas, a possible southern migration during the early part of the first millennium and the relationship between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan in the 6th century - 7th century. Further, the relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most important and famous dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta of the 8th century - 10th century time period has also been debated. Also contested is whether the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta were related by ancestry to the early Kannada, Maratha, Rajput, Reddi or Punjabi communities of the Deccan and northern India.\n\nWhile the history of the early Rashtrakutas has caused much debate, the history of the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (in present-day Gulbarga) of the 8th–10th centuries can be accurately constructed because numerous contemporaneous inscriptions and texts refer to them. The crux of the Manyakheta empire extended from the Kaveri river in the south to the Narmada in the north. At their peak they were the only south Indian empire that conquered regions in far northern India (Kannauj) as well as the extreme south (Tamilakam). The Lata branch of the empire (in present-day Gujarat) was an important dynasty belonging to the Manyakheta family line which later merged with the Manyakheta kingdom during the 9th century.\n\nThe study of the history of the early Rashtrakutas and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been made possible by the availability of numerous inscriptions spread all over the Deccan, ancient literature in Pali, contemporaneous Kannada literature such as \"Kavirajamarga\" (850) and \"Vikramarjuna Vijaya\" (941), Sanskrit writings by Somadeva, Rajashekara, Gunabhadra, Jinasena and others and the notes of Arab travellers of those times such as Suleiman, Ibn Haukal, Al Masudi, Al Istakhri and others. Scholars have left no topic unstudied in an effort to accurately propose the history of the Rashtrakutas. Theories about their lineage (\"Surya Vamsa\" or \"Chandra Vamsa\"), native region and ancestral home have been proposed using clues from inscriptions, royal emblems, ancient clan names such as \"Rashtrika\", epithets such as \"Ratta\", \"Rashtrakuta\", \"Lattalura Puravaradhiswara\", names of royalty, coins and contemporaneous literature. These theories from noted scholars have resulted in claims that the Rashtrakutas were from either Rajput, Kannadiga,Reddi, Maratha, or Punjabi origin.\n\nThe appearance of the terms \"Rathika\", \"Ristika\" (\"Rashtrika\") or \"Lathika\" in conjunction with the terms \"Kambhoja\" and \"Gandhara\" in some Ashokan inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE from Mansera and Shahbazgarhi in North Western Frontier Province (present day Pakistan), Girnar (Saurashtra) and Dhavali (Kalinga) and the use of the epithet \"Ratta\" in many later inscriptions has prompted a claim that the earliest Rashtrakutas were descendants of the \"Arattas\", natives of the Punjab region from the time of Mahabharata who later migrated south and set up kingdoms there, while another theory points more generally to north western regions of India. Based on this theory, the Arattas may have become natives of the Deccan having arrived there during the early centuries of the first millennium.\n\nThis is counter to the argument by other scholars that the term \"Rishtika\" used together with \"Petenika\" in the Ashokan inscriptions implied they were hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the term \"Ratta\" implied \"Maharatta\" ruling families from modern Maharashtra region. But this has been rejected on the basis that from ancient books such as \"Dipavamsha\" and \"Mahavamsha\" in Pali language it is known the term \"Maharatta\" and not \"Rashtrika\" has been used to signify hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the terms \"Rashtrika\" and \"Petenika\" appear to be two different displaced ruling tribes.\n\nIt is noted by another scholar that ruling clans called \"Rathis\" and \"Maharathis\" were in power in parts of present-day Karnataka as well in the early centuries of the Christian era, which is known inscriptions from the region and further proven by the discovery of lead coins from the middle of 3rd century bearing \"Sadakana Kalalaya Maharathi\" in the heart of modern Karnataka region near Chitradurga. In the face of these facts it is claimed it can no longer be maintained that the \"Rathi\" and \"Maharathi\" families were confined only to present day Maharashtra. It is claimed there is sufficient inscriptional evidence that several \"Maharathi\" families were related to Kannadiga families by marriage and they were naga worshippers, a form of worship very popular in the Mysore region (modern Karnataka). Also, no evidence to confirm that these families were either Aryan or non-Aryan is available.\n\nThe epithet \"Ratta\", it is also claimed is a Kannada word from which the word \"Rashtrakuta\" has been derived. The use of the word \"Rattagudlu\" (meaning an office) has been found in inscriptions from present day Andhra Pradesh dated prior to the 8th century indicating it was a South Indian word. From the Deoli plates and Karhad records it is argued there was a prince called Ratta and his son was called Rashtrakuta. Hence it has been argued the Rashtrakutas were of Kannada origin. It is also said the term \"Rashtra\" means \"kingdom\" and \"Kuta\" means \"lofty\" or \"Rashtra\" means province and \"Kuta\" means chieftain.\n\nAnother epithet used in inscriptions of Amoghavarsha I was \"Lattalura Puravaradhiswara\". It is proposed that it refers to their original home \"Lattalur\", modern day Latur in Maharashtra state, bordering Karnataka. This area it is claimed was predominantly Kannada speaking based on surviving vestiges of place names, inscriptions and cultural relics. It is explained that \"Latta\" is a Prakrit variation of \"Ratta\" and hence Rattana-ur became Lattana-ur and finally Lattalur. Another theory is that Latalurapura is modern day Ratnapur in Bilaspur district of central India.\n\nIn linking possible connections between the medieval Rashtrakuta families to the imperial family of Manyakheta it has been pointed out that only the family members ruling from Elichpur (Berar or modern Amravati district, modern Maharashtra) had names that were very similar to the names of Kings of the Manyakheta dynasty. From the Tivarkhed and Multhai inscriptions it is clear that the kings of this family were Durgaraja, Govindaraja, Svamikaraja and Nannaraja. These names closely resemble the names of Manyakheta kings or their extended family, the name Govindaraja appearing multiple times among the Manyakheta line. These names also appear in the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas whose family ties with the Manyakheta family is well known.\n\nIt has been noted that princes and princesses of the Rashtrakuta family used pure Kannada names such as Kambarasa, Asagavve, Revakka and Abbalabbe as their personal names indicating that they were native Kannadigas. It has been pointed out that princesses of family lineage belonging to Gujarat signed their royal edicts in Kannada even in their Sanskrit inscriptions. Some examples of this are the Navsari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda plates of his son Dhruva II. It has been attested by a scholar that the Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes signed their inscriptions in the language of their native home and the race they belonged to. It is well known that the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas were from the same family as the Manyakheta line. It is argued that if the Rashtrakutas were originally a Marathi speaking family, then the Gujarat Rashtrakutas would not have signed their inscriptions in Kannada language and that too in far away Gujarat. The theory that under the rule of the Badami Chalukyas of Kannada country, Kannada speaking dynasties were established in the far corners of the Chalukyan empire in Gujarat, Andhra and Berar (present day Vidharba region in modern Maharashtra) and hence the ancestors of King Dantidurga, the founder of the Manyakheta empire were Kannadigas. It is further claimed there is proof that in the locality where Dantidurga lived Kannada was the spoken language.\n\nSeveral Rashtrakuta families ruled India during the 6th century - 7th century period. Scholars have tried to understand their relationship with the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta by a comparative study of the emblems.\n\nThe only Rashtrakuta family whose royal emblem is similar to that of the rulers of Manyakheta, the golden eagle or Garuda \"lanchhana\" (emblem) is that of the family that ruled from Amravathi district of modern Maharashtra. It has been theorised that this line may possibly have been ancestors of the Manyakheta kings. Their inscriptions (Tivarkhed and Multhai) were issued from Achalapura (modern Elichpur) which may have been their capital. Another Rashtrakuta family ruling from Manapura with its founder King Abhimanyu had the emblem of a lion. This makes it improbable that they were the ancestors of the Manyakheta family. The location of Manapura is uncertain. John Faithfull Fleet proposed its identification with Manpur in Malwa, and then with Manpur near Bandhavgarh, but later rejected both these theories himself. Bhagawanlal Indraji identified it with Manyakheta (Malkhed) itself. Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi identified it with Man, Satara.\n\nWhile the Garuda is normally indicative Vaishnavite leanings, it has to be observed here that earlier coins belonging to King Krishna I's period use the legend \"Parama Maheshwara\", which in turn indicate staunch Shaivite leanings. This change in symbology has been used to theorise that the Rashtrakutas may have originally been Shaivites and embraced Vaishnavism later.\n\nWith regards to their \"vamsha\" (whether they belonged to \"Surya Vamsha\" (solar lineage) or \"Chandra Vamsha\" (lunar lineage), Rashtrakuta inscriptions remained silent on the issue, until about 860. Some 75 inscriptions have been found thereafter in the Deccan and Gujarat which speak about their \"vamsha\". Of these, only 8 lay claim that they belonged to the Yadava line. While one inscription of 860 claims that King Dantidurga was born to the \"Yadava Satyaki\", 1800 coins of King Krishna I (772), his successor calls him \"Parama Mahesvara\" indicating his solar lineage origin and Shaiva faith. An inscription of King Govinda III (808) mentions \"by the birth of this virtuous king, the Rashtrakuta dynasty became invincible just as the Yadava dynasty by the birth of Lord Krishna\". This is considered only a comparative statement. Only a few records attest to a possible Yadava connection and even the descendants of the Rashtrakutas such as the Gahadavalas of Kanauj, Rathors of Rajasthan claim to be from \"Surya Vamsha\" (solar lineage), a sure sign the Rashtrakutas belonged to the \"Surya Vamsha\". The opinion that the Rashtrakutas did not belong to the Yadava line is supported by another scholar as well.\n\nWhile the linguistic leanings of the early Rashtrakutas (pre-8th century) has caused considerable debate, the history and language of the imperial Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been free of such confusion. It is clear from inscriptions, coinage and prolific contemporaneous literature that the court of these Rashtrakutas was multi-lingual, and used Sanskrit and Kannada as their administrative languages and encouraged literature in Sanskrit and Kannada. Rashtrakuta inscriptions outside Karnataka are mostly in Sanskrit However this period was the very end of the classical era of literary Sanskrit and Prakrit. As such, from the Kavirajamarga of the 9th century, it is known that Kannada was popular from Kaveri river up to the Godavari river, an area covering large territory in modern Maharashtra.\n\nThe Rashtrakuta inscriptions call them the vanquishers of the \"Karnatabala\", a sobriquet used to refer to the near invincibility of the Chalukyas of Badami. This however it is claimed should not be construed to mean that the Rashtrakutas themselves were not Kannadigas. Their patronage and love of the Kannada language is apparent in that most of their inscriptions within modern Karnataka are in Kannada, while their inscriptions outside of modern Karnataka tended to be in Sanskrit. An inscription in classical Kannada of King Krishna III has also been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh which further supports the view of their affinity to the language.\n\nAdikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna, Shivakotiacharya and King Amoghavarsha I were among the noteworthy scholars in Kannada, the Apabhramsha poet Pushpadanta wrote several works and famous Sanskrit scholars such as Jinasena and Virasena (both of whom were theologians), mathematician Mahaviracharya and poets such as Trivikrama and Gunabhadra adorned their courts. The earliest extant Kannada literature belongs to this time. These Rashtrakuta kings married princess from Northern and Southern India and several Rashtrakuta branches emerged in Northern India during their imperialistic expansion in the 9th century.\n\nThe argument that the Rashtrakutas were either Marathi speaking Marathas or Telugu speaking Reddies in origin has been rejected. Reddy's in that time period had not come into martial prominence even in the Telugu speaking regions of Andhra, being largely an agrarian society of cultivators who only much later (in the 14th century - 15th century) came to control regions in the Krishna - Rajamundry districts. The Rashtrakuta period did not produce any Marathi inscriptions or literature (with the exception of a 981 CE Shravanabelagola inscription which some historians argue was inscribed later). In addition very few literary works in Prakrit language are available from this period. Jainism which played such an important role in giving patronage to early Kannada literature did not flourish as much in the present day Maharashtra region which is why no Marathi literature emerged during this period. Hence Marathi as the language of the Rashtrakutas, it is claimed, is not an acceptable argument.\n\n\n"}

The group claims independent Waldorf schools and public Waldorf methods charter schools teach anthroposophical content, that this content is religious in nature, and that the schools disguise the anthroposophical content from the public. PLANS filed federal suit in 1998 against two California public school districts, Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, to halt the Waldorf methods educational programs implemented in two of their schools. The case was ultimately dismissed on its merits in 2012.\n\nThe group was founded in 1995 and became a California non-profit corporation in 1997. Its founding officers, president Debra Snell and secretary Dan Dugan are former Waldorf school parents. The organization numbered less than 50 members when the lawsuit was brought.\n\nThe group describes its mission as to\n\n\nIn February 1998, PLANS filed suit against two California public school districts, Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, operating Waldorf-methods schools; one operating a Waldorf-based charter school and the other operating a Waldorf-based magnet school. In the complaint, PLANS argued that it was \"informed and believes that a primary purpose and primary effect of said operation of Waldorf schools is to advance religion, including the religious doctrines of Anthroposophy\", and as such were acting in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article IX of the California Constitution.\n\nIn response to PLANS' 1999 Motion for Summary Judgement, the Court ruled against their contention that the primary purpose of the program in those schools was to advance religion, finding that the two school districts targeted have a secular, non-religious purpose for implementing Waldorf teaching methods in their schools, but allowed the case to proceed on the second question, whether a primary effect of the programs may be the unintended consequence of endorsing any religion to an extent that violates the Constitution.\n\nThe trial was scheduled on September 12, 2005, and was expected to run for 16 days. The presiding judge determined two issues to be decided in the trial. The first issue was to determine if anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes - the defendants contended it was not. The second issue, which required first an affirmative ruling that anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes, would decide whether the public schools in those two districts were promoting anthroposophy to an extent that violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe trial convened as scheduled, but ended in 30 minutes after PLANS failed in their legal burden to present an offer of proof (proffer) of evidence sufficient to prove anthroposophy was a religion. PLANS' attorney told the court PLANS could not meet its burden, and that as a result of earlier evidentiary rulings before the court, it could furnish no witnesses at trial to testify anthroposophy was a religion. PLANS did attempt to introduce one piece of documentary evidence on the religion issue. Arguments were heard, but no evidence was presented during the trial. The court ruled that PLANS failed its evidentiary burden of proof, and ordered the case be dismissed on the merits.\n\nPLANS filed a notice of appeal of the decision in November, 2005. The appeal claims that the earlier rulings preventing PLANS from calling two defense expert witnesses for their own case-in-chief left them no witnesses able to give evidence that anthroposophy was a religion. The earlier rulings resulted from pretrial motions submitted six months prior to trial. The two witnesses PLANS wished to call were first disclosed by the defendants as witnesses against PLANS in the case. PLANS argues in the appeal that an automatic disclosure rule cited by the judge, though in effect at the time of trial in 2005, was not in effect in 1998 when the case was filed, and claims the witnesses were fully disclosed under the applicable rules.\n\nIn November 2010, the judge in the case dismissed it on its merits a second time. With the exception of one item, the Bylaws of the Anthroposophical Society, all of the plaintiff's evidence was either withdrawn before trial or excluded at trial as inadmissible hearsay. The plaintiff called one percipient witness, not friendly to their cause, and no expert witnesses. In his ruling, the judge cited the plaintiff's attempts to elicit from a percipient witness testimony only allowable from an expert witness, and their \"complete failure to present percipient testimony relevant to the essential issues in the case\" as already sufficient basis for an adverse judgment. He added, however, that aside from the plaintiff's effective failure to present a viable case, \"the evidence suggests that anthroposophy is a method of learning which is available to anyone regardless of their religious or philosophical persuasion. Stated another way, anthroposophy is more akin to a methodology or approach to learning as opposed to a religious doctrine or organized set of beliefs.\" The judge concluded by giving a detailed analysis on the basis of a number of determining factors why anthroposophy should not be judged a religion for Establishment Clause purposes.\n\nAfter its first ruling in 1999, the U.S. District Court—Eastern District of California has issued key rulings on the case in 2001, 2004 and 2005:\n\n\nPLANS secretary Dan Dugan delivered prepared presentations to various organizations and PLANS distributed packets of prepared print materials to school boards which were at the time considering adopting Waldorf methods in their districts. Dugan also established a webpage for the organization and moderated a public email discussion list, devoted to topics on the Waldorf curriculum, anthroposophy, and to discussion related to the Waldorf schools.\n\nIn February 1996, Dugan delivered a slide presentation to the school board in Twin Ridges Elementary School District. The district had been operating a Waldorf-methods charter school for two years. In response to Dugan's presentations, a local committee formed, headed by Baptist pastor, James Morton, and members of the committee argued both in public meetings and through the local media outlets that the school's teachings were in conflict with the US constitution's provision regarding the separation of church and state. Morton soon joined PLANS and took a place on its governing board.\n\nPLANS contacted the California Attorney General in March 1997, arguing for an investigation into Waldorf Methods public schools statewide, urging the officer to act immediately to end the funding of all such schools.\n\nIn April 1997, Dugan delivered arguments against the public funding of Waldorf methods education to a board meeting of the Yuba County Office of Education in Marysville, California. The county operated two schools for juvenile offenders which were both engaged in an experimental project to develop a nationally-replicable Waldorf-based educational model. Shortly after this meeting, PLANS set up a picket line at one of the Yuba County Waldorf-based schools. One of the school's teachers joined the PLANS campaign and became Vice-President of their governing board.\n\nIn spring 1996, PLANS made its first contact with the Sacramento Unified School District to urge district officials there to discontinue their planned Waldorf methods magnet school program. Conversion to the new program was funded in its first two years by a $491,000 federal grant, much of it used to begin training the school's faculty in the Waldorf approach. The magnet program proceeded as planned, and Waldorf methods were adopted at the beginning of the 1996/97 school year at Oak Ridge Elementary School. A parent survey conducted in the following spring indicated parents were mostly satisfied with this new teaching program. Attendance improved and none of the enrolled students applied for transfer during the district's \"open enrollment\" period. But 11 of the 26 teachers requested transfers from Oak Ridge School - half for personal reasons, and the rest objecting to the Waldorf teacher training or to its educational philosophy.\n\nOn April 30, 1997, PLANS officials distributed leaflets entitled, \"Save Oak Ridge School From the Steiner Cult\".\n\nParents formed a local committee called \"Concerned Citizens for Oak Ridge School\". In May, news media reported that controversial statements had been made by parents during an Oak Ridge meeting, accusing the school of teaching the students about witchcraft, human sacrifices, and religious altars, and charging that the children were being initiated into a cult.\n\nSoon after, PLANS held protests in front of the school, and picketers waved flags and anti-Waldorf signs, some demanding the termination of two staff members in the school.\n\nIn a newspaper interview in May, Dugan commented on the independent Waldorf school in Davis: \"They believe that there are spirits behind everything. I know there are people who would call that evil. (They) would consider anthroposophy a satanic religion.\" Dugan, described the educators as \"misguided\", not \"evil\".\n\nIn the summer of 1997, district officials voted unanimously to continue the Waldorf-methods magnet program, but to relocate it to another campus, John Morse Elementary. PLANS sought legal assistance and found lawyer Scott Kendall, an attorney affiliated with the Christian evangelical legal organization, the Pacific Justice Institute (PJI). The PJI applied for a grant on behalf of PLANS, seeking to raise funds from the evangelical Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) to initiate PLANS' legal suit against public school districts operating Waldorf methods schools. The PJI application alleged the Sacramento school engaged in \"Wicca\"-based practices, religious proselytizing and coercion, and that a third of the parents had kept their children home from school in protest. A video copy of a local televised news report about the controversy accompanied the application.\n\nADF awarded a $15,000 grant in February 1998, and immediately after, PLANS filed suit against Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, demanding a permanent injunction against the implementation of the Waldorf-methods curriculum in the schools, as well as full reimbursement for all legal costs. PLANS entered into a signed agreement with the Concerned Citizens for Oak Ridge School, promising the organization that in exchange for their efforts assisting PLANS in the lawsuit, PLANS would share one-fifth of any proceeds awarded in the event of a favorable judgement and \"cost multiplier\" fines imposed.\n\nIn December 2000 PLANS hired a private detective to attend a voluntary Winter's Solstice celebration for kindergarten through third-graders that took place in the evening in a privately rented meeting hall. The detective videotaped the ceremony. PLANS played the tape in a presentation to a school board in Chico, California, as evidence that Waldorf teaching methods are religious.\n\nIn ongoing challenges against the Waldorf methods public schools in other districts, PLANS pointedly referenced their pending lawsuit, warning that other districts too would face expensive legal challenges if they allowed Waldorf based methods in any of their schools. PLANS' challenges against Waldorf methods charter schools in the Chico Unified and Ross Valley school districts resulted in the denial of pending charter school proposals there. However, the proponents of those charters soon reapplied in alternative districts nearby and both charters were accepted: the Blue Oaks Charter School, opened September 2001 under Chico's Butte County Office of Education, and the Waldorf-Inspired School of Lagunitas, opened September 2004 in the Lagunitas School District. Sacramento Unified, Twin Ridges Elementary, and Yuba County districts also continue to operate their Waldorf methods programs. Today, there are 19 public schools in California that have adopted the Waldorf methods.\n\nThe Oak Ridge School in Sacramento became the target of threats and accusations that its teachers led children through witchcraft and sorcery practices in the classroom. While neither of these accusations could be attributed to PLANS, school officials accused PLANS of playing to public prejudices and paranoia, and arousing anxieties in the community by presenting a distorted view of their teachings to the parents of the school, most of whom weren't English proficient. Local picketers who joined the PLANS protest against Oak Ridge credited the PLANS leaflets as the initial source of their concerns, and the town's newspaper concurred, pointing to data from the school which indicated that since introducing Waldorf methods there had been positive impacts on absenteeism, voluntary re-enrollment, as well as overall parent satisfaction as measured shortly before PLANS' appearance at the school. The paper's editor accused PLANS of alarming parents with claims for which there was no evidence, including the suggestion that Waldorf methods were disguised witchcraft teachings.\n\nPublic school officials in California's Marysville, Twin Ridges, Novato and Butte schools criticized PLANS as well; a principal in the Yuba County District, which was the target of PLANS' protests over their two Waldorf methods schools, expressed outrage over \"the lies, the distortion of facts\" when questioned by a reporter. In reference to the PLANS lawsuit, the Nevada County superintendent of schools characterized it as \"despicable\" to have to redirect moneys from teachers and curriculum to pay legal costs, and insisted there was no merit to PLANS' accusations. The accuracy and expertise of PLANS officials also came under attack during lawsuit witness hearings. Six of the PLANS board directors and advisors sought to testify as expert witnesses in the case, but each was eliminated due to their lack of expertise on the subjects of anthroposophy and Waldorf education: three were eliminated by the court judge, and the other three subsequently withdrawn voluntarily by PLANS' attorney, Kendall. After reviewing key sections of the deposition testimony taken of PLANS' most vocal spokesperson, Dugan, the judge expressed \"grave doubts about any reliance upon his opinions about anything that has to do with any intellectual endeavor, including anthroposophy\" before ruling that Dugan would not be allowed to give testimony in the trial.\n\nWhen PLANS succeeded in convincing board members in Ross Valley and Chico school districts to vote against proposed Waldorf methods charters there, both proposals were welcomed by other school districts nearby, allowing the new schools to go forward., Local news commentators in one of the targeted communities castigated their local school district for caving to PLANS' threat of a lawsuit, and showcased the episode as one of the most notably \"boneheaded or downright wrong things\" of the past year.\n\nThe Anthroposophical Society in America (ASA), which is the legal representative of anthroposophy in the United States, has challenged PLANS over PLANS' characterizations of anthroposophy, as well as PLANS' suggestion that the anthroposophical movement has a direct interest or involvement in the growth of Waldorf teaching methods in the public schools. These were two claims PLANS made in its May 28, 2004, \"Motion for Summary Judgement\". Though not a direct party to the case, the ASA petitioned the court's permission to respond to this trial motion as a \"friend of the court\". The court granted ASA's petition and, in July 2004, the organization submitted an 18-page legal brief to the court challenging PLANS' assertions.\n\nAdvocates of public Waldorf education claim that Waldorf methods (charter) schools should be able to receive public funding. PLANS claims that although Waldorf representatives often state that a public \"Waldorf methods\" program has been structured so as not to violate the U.S. Constitution, these schools nevertheless have religious underpinnings. Private Waldorf schools celebrate religious festivals and observe religious holidays, for instance. PLANS asserts that in public Waldorf methods schools these activities are not always avoided and are sometimes simply renamed. PLANS alleges that morning verses recited in the public school in which children thank the sun for its warmth are actually prayers, and claim that the sun is a metaphor Steiner used to refer to Christ. In public Waldorf methods schools in the U.S., \"God\" has been removed from the verse and replaced with \"the Sun\" to avoid violation of the U.S. Constitution. PLANS claims this is a cosmetic and not a substantive change.\n\nPLANS also claims that not only private, but also public, Waldorf methods schools are anthroposophical institutions. According to PLANS, public Waldorf teachers are required in most cases to take Waldorf teacher training in which they are asked to read works almost exclusively by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, the focus of which are Steiner's tenets of anthroposophy.\n\nThe two Waldorf methods public schools PLANS brought to court presented numerous witnesses and introduced documents which contradicted this claim. The judge ruled that PLANS could not introduce evidence taken in the context of the private and independent Waldorf schools to argue their case against the public Waldorf-methods schools. The court ruled that private schools are separate entities, and insisted evidence be limited to policies and practices in effect within the litigated public school districts. The two schools furnished statements and documents in this case showing that the teachers in their Waldorf methods schools were held to the same state mandated training and credential requirements as the teachers in other public schools in those districts. In response to a demand to prepare a complete list of all Waldorf-related documents and reading materials related to training or instruction in Waldorf teaching methods, neither school district identified a single text written by Rudolf Steiner. Betty Staley, the Rudolf Steiner College staff member who developed the public teacher training program, testified the college's \"1993-1994 Teacher Training Booklists\" did not apply to the public teacher training program, and that only one of the texts from the lists, Steiner's \"Philosophy of Freedom\", was used by the program.\n\nIn their trial case, PLANS did not repeat their claim that these or other texts by Steiner were required in the public Waldorf-methods teacher training. However, they did claim that the schools \"provide[d] books for its teachers that are filled with Anthroposophical doctrine\", and that teachers were \"hire[d] because of their Anthroposophical training.\" According to Staley's testimony, references to spirituality were eliminated from the public Waldorf teachers’ training materials to meet state standards. One teacher who had participated in this program before adopting Waldorf methods in her teaching in the Oak Ridge, and later John Morse schools, reported that Steiner’s philosophy was alluded to in her training and that teachers who wanted to learn more could pay for their own classes, but that most of her colleagues from Morse did not pursue any anthroposophical training in the course of becoming public Waldorf methods teachers.\n\nPLANS claims the basis of anthroposophy is esoteric Christianity. In court documents, PLANS argued that Rudolf Steiner considered himself a Christian and that he considered anthroposophy to be a Christian form of theosophy and Rosicrucianism. PLANS argued that Steiner himself described anthroposophy as a training to access skills of psychic awareness latent in each human being, and argued that the discipline \"spiritual science\" is not a true science nor philosophy, but a theology. PLANS acknowledged that Steiner's supporters frequently concede the spiritual foundations of anthroposophy and Waldorf education, but claimed they make a false distinction between \"spiritual\" and \"religious\". PLANS considered anthroposophy to be part of a New Age religious movement, characterized by its seekers' rejection of orthodoxy and creedal forms of religious expression in favor of a more eclectic and individualized path of spiritual-psychological transformation, a process which PLANS claimed to be generally acknowledged as \"religious experience\".\n\nPLANS wanted the court to agree that Waldorf methods schools lead students through New Age rituals and interpret them as religious practices. It also wanted the court to agree that in the schools, anthroposophy permeates every subject, and that the underlying theory of the education is based on theology, not philosophy. In order to do this, PLANS first needed to convince the court that anthroposophy was a religion. This attempt was unsuccessful, and PLANS seeks to reverse the decision in appeals court.\n\nSome supporters of Waldorf education have suggested that Waldorf education does not belong in government schools. Eugene Schwartz is a prominent teacher and author who has stated that he agreed with Dugan that Waldorf education could not properly be separated from anthroposophy. In Schwartz's view, although Waldorf education is not sectarian, the children are intended to have inwardly religious experiences. In his speech he exemplified this with the way the origin and history of the Jews is taught in grade three in independent Waldorf schools. Schwartz was fired from his position at a teaching college shortly after the speech, and in a later interview, claimed there were many other Waldorf teachers who agreed with him but were afraid to speak out. In Schwartz's opinion, Waldorf education has the goal of making \"everything sacramental\", and that \"willing, feeling, and thinking\" are \"soul forces\" which are intentionally brought to every aspect of the education. Schwartz objected to educators who would reject the movement's religious aspect to suit the requirements of public education. In the interview, Schwartz lamented the fact that, in his view, public Waldorf methods schools are watered-down imitations of authentic Waldorf education.\n\nSchwartz has since become an active promoter of Waldorf education in charter and public schools.\n\n"}

It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the Cabinet of North Korea. The prize can be granted to works of art or people. People's Prize has been an important award in the field of North Korean cinema.\n\nThe works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, Korean revolutionary opera, acupuncture and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.\n\nThe People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.\n\nThe first North Korean feature film \"My Hometown\" (1949) was directed by Kang Hongshik. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. Kim Il-sung praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's \"\". The Workers' Party gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an \"excellent textbook\" for the workers party.\n\nSome of the works, which did not become recognized as \"Immortal classics\", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film \"Five Guerilla Brothers\" (1968) directed by Choe Ik-gyu, and overseen by Kim Jong-il himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were \"A Flowering Village\" and \"A Family of Workers\" (1971). In the case of the \"A Family of Workers\", Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the seed theory. However, some of Kim Jong-il's movies, such as \"Sea of Blood\" (1968) and \"Flower girl\" (1972), became \"Immortal classics\".\n\nIn 1965 the Chongryon established Chosun University's teaching staff in Japan received the prize.\n\nMany of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. \"Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas\" is regarded as classic of literature of the Workers' Party, and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.\n\nPeople's Prize winner Kim Song-gun's major work \"Waves of the Sea Kumgang\" was used as a background for a group photo with Kim Jong-il and Bill Clinton during Clinton's visit to North Korea in 2009. Kim Song-gun received the award for his painting \"Waves of the Sea Kumgang\" in 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An advocate for African American rights in Copiah County, Mississippi, he was murdered while voting in 1883 after defying the orders of local white supremacist Democrats, who told him not to vote.\n\nMatthews, best known by the nickname \"Print\", was born on August 27, 1840,near Hazlehurst, Mississippi, the Copiah County seat.\n\nAlthough his parents were wealthy and owned 35 slaves. Matthews supported the Union. During the American Civil War, most local whites supported the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the war, Matthews ran a store and was elected the county sheriff. When Democrats regained power in the state government in 1875, Matthews helped organize the Independent Party in Copiah County, consisting of black and white farmers. However, in 1881, Democrats began night riding to intimidate African Americans and attempt to suppress their voting, and Matthews lost his bid for re-election by 84 votes, as Democrats claimed a mule had reached through a window and eaten all the ballots from Mt. Hope precinct, primarily African American and supportive of Matthews (although 2 blacks remained on the county council).\n\nIn 1883, the night rides grew worse, although the Independent Party slate only included one black. Ablack church was burned and a husband and wife murdered on October 26. The riders ordered voters not to vote for the Independent Party in the upcoming 1883 elections; and blacks and some whites even spent the night before the election in the woods for fear of further intimidation tactics.\n\nThe white Democratic leaders of Hazlehurst delivered a written ultimatum to Matthews, ordering him not to vote. When he persisted, the precinct captain, a white farmer and doctor named Erastus Benjamin Wheeler (1840-1900, nicknamed \"Ras\") who had an account at Matthews' store, reached inside a wooden box for a double-barreled shotgun and shot and killed Matthews at the polls.\n\nThe evening after his murder, Matthews' political enemies, organized in a local group known as the \"Trail-Hold Club\", gathered in the yard of his residence. They mocked and celebrated the killing. A mass meeting \"resolved\" that the Matthews family \"shall keep out of politics in Copiah county\" and some talked of having Wheeler run for governor. Wheeler was elected marshal of Hazlehurst, Meanwhile, the gravedigger who had helped bury Matthews on his own property was threatened and left town, as did the Matthews family (though some members including his then-15 year old son later returned).\n\nAfter a special investigation, Wheeler was tried in May 1884. The \"New York Times\" covered the trial. The carefully chosen, all-white jury quickly returned a verdict of not guilty, much to the pleasure and expectation of the judge and the community. The jury posted a statement noting that if an \"error\" occurred, it was \"one of the head, and not of the heart.\"\n\nJ.T. Dameron, a merchant, testified that he saw Ras Wheeler in a street car in the capital of Jackson on the 13th or 14th of February. He said that Wheeler was talking in a low tone. He said; \"Yes, old Hoar is coming down here on an investigation committee. If I get a crack at him I will kill him, too. I killed Print Matthews, or rather it was the Democratic party that did it. If it had not been for politics, I would not have done it; but it was politics that did it.\"\n\nRas Wheeler went on to have a successful political career in the state.\n\nMatthews was survived by his wife Mary \"Tine\" Barlow, whom he had married on June 6, 1862. Their son John Prentiss Matthews, Jr. carried on his father's principles and became a leader in Republican politics. President Benjamin Harrison made him postmaster of a town 130 miles away, Carrollton, Mississippi. On Christmas Day, 1890, local Democrats shot the 22 year old dead. Another son, Simon Matthews, became an activist in the People's Party during the 1890s, when a biracial coalition temporarily elected some positions, defeating the Democrats.\n"}
{"id": "41585725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41585725", "title": "Project Cybersyn", "text": "Project Cybersyn\n\nProject Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971–1973 during the presidency of Salvador Allende aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.\n\nProject Cybersyn was based on viable system model theory and a neural network approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (\"Cybernet\") in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (\"Cyberstride\") that would monitor production indicators (such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism) in real time, and alert the workers in the first case, and in abnormal situations also the central government, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (\"CHECO\", for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (\"Opsroom\") would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.\n\nThe principal architect of the system was British operations research scientist Stafford Beer, and the system embodied his notions of organisational cybernetics in industrial management. One of its main objectives was to devolve decision-making power within industrial enterprises to their workforce in order to develop self-regulation of factories.\n\nThe project's name in English (Cybersyn) is a portmanteau of the words \"cybernetics\" and \"synergy\". Since the name is not euphonic in Spanish, in that language the project was called \"Synco\", both an initialism for the Spanish \"Sistema de INformación y COntrol\", \"system of information and control\", and a pun on the Spanish \"cinco\", the number five, alluding to the five levels of Beer's viable system model.\n\nStafford Beer was a British consultant in management cybernetics. He also sympathized with the stated ideals of Chilean socialism of maintaining Chile's democratic system and the autonomy of workers instead of imposing a Soviet-style system of top-down command and control.\n\nIn July 1971, Fernando Flores, a high-level employee of the Chilean Production Development Corporation (CORFO) contacted Beer for advice on incorporating Beer's theories into the management of the newly nationalized sector of Chile's economy. Beer saw this as a unique opportunity to implement his ideas on a national scale. More than offering advice, he left most of his other consulting business and devoted much time to what became Project Cybersyn. He traveled to Chile often to collaborate with local implementors and used his personal contacts to secure help from British technical experts.\n\nThe implementation schedule was very aggressive, and the system had reached an advanced prototype stage at the start of 1973.\n\nThe system was most useful in October 1972, when about 40,000 striking truck drivers blocked the access streets that converged towards Santiago. According to Gustavo Silva (executive secretary of energy in CORFO), the system's telex machines helped organize the transport of resources into the city with only about 200 trucks driven by strike-breakers, lessening the potential damage caused by the 40,000 striking truck drivers.\n\nAfter the CIA-backed military coup on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed.\n\nThere were 500 unused telex machines bought by the previous government. Each was put into one factory. In the control centre in Santiago, each day data coming from each factory (several numbers, such as raw material input, production output and number of absentees) were put into a computer, which made short-term predictions and necessary adjustments. There were four levels of control (firm, branch, sector, total), with algedonic feedback. If one level of control did not remedy a problem in a certain interval, the higher level was notified. The results were discussed in the operations room and a top-level plan was made.\n\nThe software for Cybersyn was called \"Cyberstride\", and used Bayesian filtering and Bayesian control. It was written by Chilean engineers in consultation with a team of 12 British programmers.\n\nThe futuristic operations room was designed by a team led by the interface designer Gui Bonsiepe. It was furnished with seven swivel chairs (considered the best for creativity) with buttons, which were designed to control several large screens that could project the data, and other panels with status information, although these were of limited functionality as they could only show pre-prepared graphs. This consisted of slides.\n\nThe vision had been distribution of control and involvement of workers in business planning. The design looked more like bureaucratic centralisation of control via bottom up reporting and top-down direction. Workers were expected to perform processes and use resources in the ways that had been modelled and planned. Any significant deviation from was to be reported upwards, and corrective directives were to be cascaded downwards.\n\nThe project is described in some detail in the second edition of Strafford Beer's books \"Brain of the Firm\" and \"Platform for Change\". The latter book includes proposals for social innovations such as having representatives of diverse 'stakeholder' groups into the control centre.\n\nThe Ops room used Tulip chairs similar to those used in the American science fiction TV programme \"Star Trek\", although according to the designers, the style was not influenced by science fiction movies.\n\nComputer scientist Paul Cockshott and economist Alvin Cottrell referenced Project Cybersyn in their 1993 book \"Towards a New Socialism\", citing it as an inspiration for their own proposed model of economic planning under socialism.\n\nChilean science fiction author Jorge Baradit published a Spanish-language science fiction novel \"Synco\" in 2008. It is an alternate history science fantasy novel set in a 1979, of which he said: \"It stops the military coup, the socialist government consolidates and creates the first cybernetic state, a universal example, the true third way, a miracle.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "60534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60534", "title": "Shilling", "text": "Shilling\n\nThe shilling is a unit of currency formerly used in Austria, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States, and other British Commonwealth countries.\nCurrently the shilling is used as a currency in four east African countries: Kenya (Kenyan shilling), Tanzania (Tanzanian shilling), Uganda (Ugandan shilling), and Somalia (Somali shilling). It is also the proposed currency that the east African community plans to introduce (east African shilling).\nThe word \"shilling\" comes from old English \"Scilling\", a monetary term meaning twentieth of a pound, and from the Proto-Germanic root *skiljaną meaning 'to separate.' The word \"Scilling\" is mentioned in the earliest recorded Germanic law codes, those of Æthelberht of Kent. \n\nSlang terms for the old shilling coins include \"bob\" and \"hog\". While the derivation of \"bob\" is uncertain, John Camden Hotten in his 1864 Slang Dictionary says the original version was \"bobstick\" and wonders if it is connected with Sir Robert Walpole.\n\nOne abbreviation for shilling is s (for \"solidus\", see £sd). Often it was represented by a solidus symbol (\"/\"), which may have originally stood for a long s or ſ, thus \"1/9\" would be one shilling and ninepence (and equivalent to 21d; the shilling itself was equal to 12d). A price with no pence was sometimes written with a solidus and a dash: \"11/–.\"\n\nThe solidus symbol is still used for the Kenyan shilling (one of the successors to East African shilling), rather than \"sh\".\n\nDuring the Great Recoinage of 1816, the mint was instructed to coin one troy pound (weighing 5760 grains or 373 g) of standard (0.925 fine) silver into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations. This set the weight of the shilling, and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin, at 87.2727 grains or 5.655 grams from 1816 until 1990, when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced.\n\nIn the past, the English world has had various myths about the shilling. One myth was that it was deemed to be the value of a cow in Kent or a sheep elsewhere.\n\nA shilling was a coin used in England from the reign of Henry VII (or Edward VI around 1550). The shilling continued in use after the Acts of Union of 1707 created a new United Kingdom from the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and under Article 16 of the Articles of Union, a common currency for the new United Kingdom was created.\n\nThe term \"shilling\" () was in use in Scotland from early Middle Ages.\n\nThe common currency created in 1707 by Article 16 of the Articles of Union continued in use until decimalisation in 1971. In the traditional pounds, shillings and pence system, there were 20 shillings per pound and 12 pence per shilling, and thus there were 240 pence in a pound.\n\nThree coins denominated in multiple shillings were also in circulation at this time. They were:\nAt decimalisation in 1971, the shilling coin was superseded by the new five-pence piece, which initially was of identical size and weight and had the same value, and inherited the shilling's slang name of a \"bob\". Shillings remained in circulation until the five pence coin was reduced in size in 1991.\n\nBetween 1701 and the unification of the currencies in 1825, the Irish shilling was valued at 13 pence and known as the \"black hog\", as opposed to the 12-pence English shillings which were known as \"white hogs\".\n\nIn the Irish Free State and Republic of Ireland the shilling coin was issued as \"scilling\" in Irish. It was worth 1/20th of an Irish pound, and was interchangeable at the same value to the British coin, which continued to be used in Northern Ireland. The coin featured a bull on the reverse side. The first minting, from 1928 until 1941, contained 75% silver, more than the equivalent British coin. The original Irish shilling coin (retained after decimalisation)) was withdrawn from circulation on 1 January 1993, when a smaller five pence coin was introduced.\n\nAustralian shillings, twenty of which made up one Australian pound, were first issued in 1910, with the Australian coat of arms on the reverse and King Edward VII on the face. The coat of arms design was retained through the reign of King George V until a new ram's head design was introduced for the coins of King George VI. This design continued until the last year of issue in 1963. In 1966, Australia's currency was decimalised and the shilling was replaced by a ten cent coin (Australian), where 10 shillings made up one Australian dollar.\n\nThe slang term for a shilling coin in Australia was \"deener\". The slang term for a shilling as currency unit was \"bob\", the same as in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter 1966, shillings continued to circulate, as they were replaced by 10-cent coins of the same size and weight.\n\nNew Zealand shillings, twenty of which made up one New Zealand pound, were first issued in 1933 and featured the image of a Maori warrior carrying a taiaha \"in a warlike attitude\" on the reverse. In 1967, New Zealand's currency was decimalised and the shilling was replaced by a ten cent coin of the same size and weight. Ten cent coins minted through the remainder of the 1960s included the legend \"ONE SHILLING\" on the reverse. Smaller 10-cent coins were introduced in 2006.\n\nShillings were used in Malta, prior to decimalisation in 1972, and had a face value of five Maltese cents.\n\nIn British Ceylon, an shilling (, ) was equivalent to eight fanams. With the replacement of the rixdollar by the rupee in 1852, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to half a rupee. On the decimalisation of the currency in 1869, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to 50 Ceylon cents. The term continued to be used colloquially until the late 20th century.\n\nThe East African shilling was in use in the British colonies and protectorates of British Somaliland, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar from 1920, when it replaced the rupee, until after those countries became independent, and in Tanzania after that country was formed by the merger of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964. Upon independence in 1960, the East African shilling in the State of Somaliland (former British Somaliland) and the Somali somalo in the Trust Territory of Somalia (former Italian Somaliland) were replaced by the Somali shilling.\n\nIn 1966.5, the East African Monetary Union broke up, and the member countries replaced their currencies with the Kenyan shilling, the Ugandan shilling and the Tanzanian shilling, respectively. Though all these currencies have different values at present, there were plans to reintroduce the East African shilling as a new common currency by 2009, although this has not come about.\n\nIn the thirteen British colonies that became the United States in 1776, British money was often in circulation. Each colony issued its own paper money, with pounds, shillings, and pence used as the standard units of account. Some coins were minted in the colonies, such as the 1652 pine-tree shilling in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. After the United States adopted the dollar as its unit of currency and accepted the gold standard, one British shilling was worth 24 US cents. Due to ongoing shortages of US coins in some regions, shillings continued to circulate well into the 19th century. Shillings are described as the standard monetary unit throughout the autobiography of Solomon Northup (1853) and mentioned several times in the Horatio Alger, Jr. story, \"Ragged Dick\" (1868).\n\nThe Somali shilling is the official currency of Somalia. It is subdivided into 100 \"cents\" (English), \"senti\" (Somali, also سنت) or \"centesimi\" (Italian).\n\nThe Somali shilling has been the currency of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the East African shilling was introduced to the former British Somaliland protectorate. Following independence in 1960, the somalo of Italian Somaliland and the East African shilling (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the Somali shilling. Names used for the denominations were cent, centesimo (plural: centesimi) and سنت (plurals: سنتيمات and سنتيما) together with shilling, scellino (plural: scellini) and شلن.\n\nThat same year, the \"Banca Nazionale Somala\" issued notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 scellini/shillings. In 1975, the \"Bankiga Qaranka Soomaaliyeed\" (Somali National Bank) introduced notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 shilin/shillings. These were followed in 1978 by notes of the same denominations issued by the \"Bankiga Dhexe Ee Soomaaliya\" (Central Bank of Somalia). 50 shilin/shillings notes were introduced in 1983, followed by 500 shilin/shillings in 1989 and 1000 shilin/shillings in 1990. Also in 1990 there was an attempt to reform the currency at 100 to 1, with new banknotes of 20 and 50 new shilin prepared for the redenomination.\n\nFollowing the breakdown in central authority that accompanied the civil war, which began in the early 1990s, the value of the Somali shilling was disrupted. The Central Bank of Somalia, the nation's monetary authority, also shut down operations. Rival producers of the local currency, including autonomous regional entities such as the Somaliland territory, subsequently emerged.\n\nSomalia's newly established Transitional Federal Government revived the defunct Central Bank of Somalia in the late 2000s. In terms of financial management, the monetary authority is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing monetary policy. Owing to a lack of confidence in the Somali shilling, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected to come to an end as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.\n\nThe Somaliland shilling is the official currency of Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia. The currency is not recognised as legal tender by the international community, and it currently has no official exchange rate. It is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the territory's central bank. Although the authorities in Somaliland have attempted to bar usage of the Somali shilling, Somalia's official currency is still the preferred means of exchange for many peoples in the region.\n\nElsewhere in the former British Empire, forms of the word \"shilling\" remain in informal use.\nIn Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, \"selen\" is used in Bislama and Pijin to mean \"money\"; in Malaysia, \"syiling\" (pronounced like \"shilling\") means \"coin\". In Egypt and Jordan the \"shillin\" () is equal to 1/20th (five \"qirshes\" — , ) of the Egyptian pound or the Jordanian dinar. In Belize, the term \"shilling\" is commonly used to refer to twenty-five cents.\n\nThe Austrian schilling was the currency of Austria between March 1, 1924 and 1938 and again between 1945 and 2002. It was replaced by the euro at a fixed parity of €1 = 13.7603 schilling. The schilling was divided into 100 groschen.\n\nShillings were issued in the Scandinavian countries \"(skilling)\" until the Scandinavian Monetary Union of 1873, and in the city of Hamburg, Germany.\n\nIn Poland \"szeląg\" was used.\n\nIn the principalities covering present Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg, the cognate term \"schelling\" was used as an equivalent 'arithmetic' currency, a 'solidus' representing 12 'denarii' or 1/20 'pound', while actual coins were rarely physical multiples of it, but still expressed in these terms.\n\nThe \"soll\", later the \"sou\", both also derived from the Roman solidus, were the equivalent coins in France, while the (nuevo) sol (PEN) remains the currency of Peru.\n\nAs in France, the Peruvian sol was originally named after the Roman solidus, but the name of the Peruvian currency is now much more closely linked to the Spanish word for the sun (\"sol\"). This helps explain the name of its temporary replacement, the inti, named for the Incan sun god.\n\n"}
{"id": "1481725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1481725", "title": "Soubrette", "text": "Soubrette\n\nA soubrette is a type of operatic soprano voice fach, often cast as a female stock character in opera and theatre. The term arrived in English from Provençal via French, and means \"conceited\" or \"coy\". A soubrette is also defined as a young woman regarded as flirtatious or frivolous.\n\nIn theatre, a soubrette is a comedy character who is vain and girlish, mischievous, lighthearted, coquettish and gossipy—often a chambermaid or confidante of the ingénue, she often displays a flirtatious or even sexually aggressive nature. The soubrette appeared in commedia dell'arte scenarios, often in the role of Columbina, where the actress would provide the details of her behavior and dialogue. From there, she moved to the works of Molière, which were influenced by the Commedia; the role of Dorine in \"Tartuffe\" (1664) fits the description. A famous example, though a hundred years later, is Suzanne in Beaumarchais' \"Le Mariage de Figaro\" (1784).\n\nIn classical music and opera, the term \"soubrette\" refers to both a soprano voice type and a type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet timbre, a tessitura in the mid-range, and with no extensive coloratura. A soubrette's vocal range extends approximately from middle C (C) to \"high D\" (D). The voice has a lighter vocal weight than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes but as they grow older and the voice matures more physically they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a light lyric soprano, a lyric coloratura soprano, or a coloratura mezzo-soprano. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career. The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and spinto soprano.\n\nThe soubrette roles are typically found in comic operas or operettas and they usually portray good-looking, youthful girls who are flirtatious, saucy, and street-wise. Typically these roles are sung by younger singers and both sopranos and mezzo-sopranos are cast in them. Many soubrette roles have a considerable amount of spoken German dialogue, and therefore the soubrette singer must possess both an excellent comprehension of the German language and considerable acting skills. It is rare today to find true soubrettes singing in major opera houses as their voices are typically unable to carry over larger orchestras in larger halls. Often lyric, coloratura, and mezzo-sopranos are cast in soubrette roles, especially in the early part of their singing careers. This does not mean that these singers are soubrette sopranos but it does mean they can play soubrette roles. The coloratura soprano has a higher range, can sing more dexterous vocal passages and has a somewhat brighter sound than the soubrette. The lyric soprano has a richer voice and higher range than the soubrette soprano. The mezzo-soprano can sing as high as a soubrette but with a darker timbre and heavier weight in the voice. Mezzos also have a much more extensive range in the lower register. In addition, the beautiful light voice of the soubrette is ideal for baroque music, early music and baroque opera, as well as many art songs. However, the soubrette soprano voice is limited even in this repertoire by its lack of coloratura skill and relatively limited range. Many operettas and musicals include soubrette characters, such as Valencienne in \"The Merry Widow\" and in Gilbert and Sullivan, the Jessie Bond mezzo-soprano roles such as Cousin Hebe (\"H.M.S. Pinafore\") and Lady Angela (\"Patience\"). Another example is the character Ellie Mae Chipley, who sings \"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\" in Kern and Hammerstein's \"Show Boat\".\n\nSource:\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and tools with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them. This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall scientific and technological literacy.\n\nTechnology education should not be confused with educational technology. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.\n\nTechnology education is an offshoot of the Industrial Arts tradition in the United States and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries. In 1980, through what was called the \"Futuring Project\", the name of \"industrial arts education\" was changed to be \"technology education\" in New York State; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy. Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED). \n\nIn Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.\n\nIn the 21st century, Mars suit design was utilized as a topic for technology education. Technical education is entirely different from general education\n\nTeachThought, a private entity, described technology education as being in the “status of childhood and bold experimentation.” A survey of teachers across the United States by an independent market research company found out that 86 percent of teacher-respondents agree that technology must be used in the classroom. 96 percent say it promotes engagement of students and 89% agree technology improves student outcomes. Technology is present in many education systems. As of July 2018, American public schools provide one desktop computer for every five students and spend over $3 billion annually on digital content. In school year 2015-2016, the government conducted more state-standardized testing for elementary and middle levels through digital platforms instead of the traditional pen and paper method.\n\nThe digital revolution offers fresh learning prospects. Students can learn online even if they are not inside the classroom. Advancement in technology entails new approaches of combining present and future technological improvements and incorporating these innovations into the public education system. Technology space in education is huge. It advances and evolves rapidly. In the United Kingdom, computer technology helped elevate standards in different schools to confront various challenges. The UK adopted the “Flipped Classroom” concept after it become popular in the United States. The idea is to reverse conventional teaching methods through he delivery of instructions online and outside of traditional classrooms.\n\nIn Europe, the European Commission espoused a Digital Education Plan in January 2018. The program consists of 11 initiatives that support utilization of technology and digital capabilities in education development. The Commission also adopted an action plan called the Staff Working Document which details its strategy in implementing digital education. This plan includes three priorities formulating measures to assist European Union member-states to tackle all related concerns. The whole framework will support the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning and European Classification of Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations.\n\nIn East Asia, The World Bank co-sponsored a yearly (two-day) international symposium In October 2017 with South Korea’s Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the World Bank to support education and ICT concerns for industry practitioners and senior policymakers. Participants plan and discuss issues in use of new technologies for schools within the region.\n\n"}

There was some controversy over the voting process after \"The Guide\" was nominated by Ukraine.\n\nA teenage boy, Sergey, arrives at a boarding school for the deaf. There he tries to find his place in the hierarchy of the academic community, which operates like a Gang ruled by the King of the group. Their squad participates in acts of violence, robbery, sex and prostitution. When one of the boys who helps in pimping two girls from the school gets crushed by a truck, Sergey takes his place. Soon however, he falls in love with one of the girls, Anna, whom he impregnates. Sergey finds a purse on a train which he steals, giving the money to Anna for a makeshift abortion. Much later, Sergey follows one of the teachers home, knocks him unconscious, and robs him, giving the substantial sum to Anna and then raping her. Anna gets an abortion, and they set apart over time. One of the gangmasters prepare to send the two girls to Italy, but Sergey ruins Anna's passport and is eventually beaten by King and his gang.

I am confident that he will quickly become a world-renowned director, and I am excited and proud to be sharing his striking first feature with North America.\" At the news of the acquisition director Slaboshpytskiy stated, \"I am very glad that my film will be released in the United States. I have always believed in the universality of film’s language, and have always believed that dialogue and subtitles change the way different audiences perceive the film in different countries.\" On 6 July 2014, it was confirmed that MCF MegaCom had bought the distribution right to ex-Yugoslavia territories, Art Fest had obtained the film rights to Bulgaria, and Film Europe Media Co had acquired the distribution rights to Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of critics gave the film a \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 92 reviews with an average score of 7.5/10, with the consensus \"A bleak, haunting drama whose wordless dialogue speaks volumes, The Tribe is a bold, innovative take on silent films for a contemporary audience.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 (out of 100) based on 27 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \"generally favorable.\"\n\nPeter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" scored the piece four out of five stars, writing, \"I can't stop thinking about it.\" while too praising Slaboshpytskiy's ability to \"[draw] on Samuel Beckett or Peter Brook to create a universal language of anxiety.\" while concluding the sentiment, \"What an intriguing film.\" Leslie Felperin of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the piece, stating, \"The use of sign language, deafness and silence itself adds several heady new ingredients to the base material, alchemically creating something rich, strange and very original.\" He also admired the film's \"silky smooth steadicam\" cinematography of Vasyanovych. As well as comparing the language of gestures and body posture as \"akin to watching a ballet like Coppélia or The Nutcracker\".\n\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" heralded the film and its director, Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, by stating: \"Actions, emotions and desperate impulses speak far louder than words in The Tribe, a formally audacious coup de cinema that marks a stunning writing-directing debut for Ukrainian filmmaker [Slaboshpytskiy].\" Chang was most praiseworthy of Vasyanovych's cinematography, Stepanskiy's sound design as \"vividly detailed\" and described Odudenko's production designs as \"harshly lit corridors and graffiti-strewn exteriors\".

He continued by praising Slaboshpytskiy's risky endeavour, to which he \"follows through with intrepidity and absolute rigor\" as well as Vasyanovych’s \"precise compositions\". Romney further adds, \"The Tribe, in short, was the most surprising, most inventive, and in many ways most disturbing film I’ve seen in Cannes this year.\" He later named the film among the best movies of 2014.\n\nEric Kohn of \"indieWIRE\" gave the film an \"A-\" rating, adding, \"While the specifics remain uncertain, it's never particularly difficult to keep up with the movie's pace, since their actions speak plainly enough -- and sometimes add far more expressiveness than any verbal exchanges could provide.\" Praising Slaboshpytskiy and Vasyanovych's usage of the steadicam approach, \"capturing the actors' exchanges in their full-bodied entirety\"; and Slaboshpytskiy as \"brilliantly [developing] a suspenseful core through the mysteries of their conversations\". He admired Grigory Fesenko's \"body movements\" and \"precise details\" through gestures.\n\nFred Topel wrote, in his review for \"CraveOnline\", \"The piece de resistance is a taboo subject that unfolds in an elaborate single take. It was so harrowing I would have applauded if it would not have been completely inappropriate for the subject matter to do so.\" Topel praised the cast as \"made up of non actors but you wouldn’t suspect that\" adding, \"They are full of life and energy\" \n\nJessica Kiang of \"The Playlist\" gave the film an \"A-\" rating and wrote, \"It might sound glib, but it's the literal truth: \"The Tribe\" left us speechless.\" \n\n\"Electric Sheep Magazine\"'s Greg Klymkiw granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating \"A sad, shocking and undeniably harrowing dramatic reflection of Ukraine with the searing truthful lens of a stylistic documentary treatment (at times similar to that of Austrian auteur Ulrich Seidl)\". He continues by commending that, \"Visuals and actions are what drive the film and ultimately prove to be far more powerful than words ever could be.\" Luke Y. Thompson of \"Topless Robot\" spoke most highly of the film, declaring, \"Compelling, upsetting, brutal and brilliant, The Tribe is one of the best works of cinema of the year - a familiar template recreated in what, for most, will be an entirely new world.\" Too adding, \"[...] this is a movie that will and should be used in cinema schools as a master class in how film is a visual medium.\" \n\n\n"}

{"id": "3293804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3293804", "title": "Tippet", "text": "Tippet\n\nA tippet is a scarf-like narrow piece of clothing, worn over the shoulders. It may also be likened to a stole in the secular rather than ecclesiastic sense of this word. Tippets evolved in the fourteenth century from long sleeves and typically had one end hanging down to the knees. In later fashion, a tippet is often any scarf-like wrap, usually made of fur, such as the sixteenth century zibellino or the fur-lined capelets worn in the mid-18th century.\n\nThe ceremonial scarf worn by Anglican priests, deacons, and lay readers is formally called a tippet, although it is often known colloquially as a \"preaching scarf\". It is worn with choir dress and hangs straight down at the front. Ordained clergy (priests and deacons) wear a black tippet, while readers (known in some dioceses as licensed lay ministers) wear a blue one. Commissioned evangelists of the Church Army are presented with a cherry red 'collar' type tippet, as a sign of authority to preach, but some replace this with a scarf form of the tippet, but retaining the distinctive red colour. A red tippet is also worn in some Anglican dioceses by commissioned lay workers.\n\nTippets are often worn for the Daily Offices of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, as required in Canon B8 of the Church of England (in the Canon, the word \"scarf\" is used in reference to the tippet). Stricter low church clergy may wear the tippet and choir dress during any church service, whether Communion is celebrated or not. This follows a practice that was enforced from the Reformation until the late 19th century. By contrast, Anglican Catholics tend not to wear the tippet, often preferring to wear the choir habit of Roman Catholic clergy instead.\n\nClergy who are entitled to wear medals, orders, or awards may fix them to the upper left side of the tippet on suitable occasions (such as Remembrance Sunday). Sometimes the right end of the tippet is embroidered with the coat of arms of the ecclesiastical institution of which the cleric is a member, but some deplore this usage. It is common for English cathedral Canons to have the coat of arms of their cathedral embroidered on one or both sides of the tippet. \n\nThe tippet is a different item from the stole, which although often worn like a scarf is a Eucharistic vestment, usually made of richer material, and varying according to the liturgical colour of the day.\n\nIn the British Army, all serving chaplains are issued with a tippet to be worn directly over battledress when ministering in conflict zones. Anglican chaplains wear the standard black tippet, whilst Roman Catholic chaplains are distinguished by a violet coloured tippet.\n\nSome Lutherans also use the tippet. Members of the Lutheran Society of the Holy Trinity wear a black tippet embroidered with the Society's seal when presiding at the daily office.\n\nThe black preaching scarf (or rarely blue, grey, or green) is also worn by some Scottish Presbyterian ministers and other non-conformist clergy.\n\nA different and non-religious sort of tippet, a shoulder-length cape, has been part of the uniform of British military nurses or of nursing uniforms in Commonwealth countries. These are often decorated with piping and may have badges or insignia indicating the wearer's rank.\n"}
{"id": "32369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32369", "title": "Vagueness", "text": "Vagueness\n\nIn philosophy, vagueness refers to an important problem in semantics, metaphysics and philosophical logic. Definitions of this problem vary. A predicate is sometimes said to be vague if the bound of its extension is indeterminate, or appears to be so. The predicate \"is tall\" is vague because there seems to be no particular height at which someone becomes tall. Relatedly, a predicate is sometimes said to be vague if there are borderline cases of its application, such that in these cases competent speakers of the language may faultlessly disagree over whether the predicate applies. The disagreement over whether a hotdog is a sandwich suggests that “sandwich” is vague. \n\nVagueness is commonly introduced by the Sorites paradox. A standard form of this paradox features a 2000 man sequence of progressively taller men, starting with a paradigm case of a short man at one extreme, say George Costanza, and at the other extreme, a paradigm case of a tall one, say Kramer. \n\n\nSorites paradoxes exploit the intuition that some vague predicates are \"tolerant\" with respect to small enough differences on a dimension decisive of their application. This principle may seem to hold on the basis that (for example) no particular height is more justified than others in its vicinity as a cut-off for shortness. This intuition has been called the \"No Sharp Boundaries\" thesis about vague predicates and plays a prominent role in theories of vagueness. \n\nThe Sorites paradox dates to the fourth century BCE and is attributed to Eubulides of Melitus. It has received a resurgence of attention since 1975, when three papers published in \"Synthese\" effectively conceived the contemporary study of vagueness. \n\nThe problem posed by vagueness is to explain its particular kind of indeterminacy. Does vagueness render large portions of ordinary language meaningless? Likely not, since we frequently use vague language to great effect in ordinary discourse. If not, what \"is\" vagueness, at the level of predicate logic? How is it to be modeled without contradiction, and without sacrificing too much of classical logic? Is vagueness semantic, metaphysical or epistemic? \n\nVagueness has in its own right reaped the attention of an extensive literature. In addition, vagueness is a topic that touches many other questions in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science, not to mention ordinary conversation. \n\nVagueness is philosophically important. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of \"right\" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances precising definitions.\n\nVagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept. Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc. Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as gender can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from transsexuals' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see intersex).\n\nMany scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance species in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as ring species. Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases. As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is \"vague\" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding huskies and wolves: are they dogs? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.\n\nThe philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is - which is closely related to the problem of the paradox of the heap, a.k.a. sorites paradox - has been the subject of much philosophical debate.\n\nOne theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between \"perfect falsity\", for example, the statement \"Bill Clinton is bald\", to \"perfect truth\", for, say, \"Patrick Stewart is bald\". In ordinary logics, there are only two truth-values: \"true\" and \"false\". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing \"an infinite number of truth-values\" along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by \"1\", and perfect falsity by \"0\". Borderline cases are thought of as having a \"truth-value\" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) and Dorothy Edgington (1993).\n\nAnother theoretical approach is known as \"supervaluationism\". This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of \"truth value gaps\". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be \"made precise\" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.\n\nGiven a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate 'supertrue' as meaning \"true on all precisifications\". This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. 'Frank is bald', where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the tautologies of sentential logic, such as 'Frank is bald or Frank is not bald', will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either 'Frank is bald' or 'Frank is not bald' will be true. Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can \"rescue\" them is seen as a virtue.\n\nSubvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or \"true on at least some precisifications\". \n\nSubvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has 'truth-value gluts'. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon. Of a borderline case of 'bald man' it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.\n\nA fourth approach, known as the \"epistemicist view\", has been defended by Timothy Williamson (1994), R. A. Sorensen (1988) and (2001), and Nicholas Rescher (2009). They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is explained as being due to one's ignorance. For example, on the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old. It is just that one may sometimes be ignorant of this fact.\n\nOne possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague. Consider Peter Unger's example of a cloud (from his famous 1980 paper, \"The Problem of the Many\"): it's not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it's part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer. So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely. This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to Gareth Evans's short paper \"Can There Be Vague Objects?\" (1978). Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. \"Princeton = Princeton Borough\"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right. Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.\n\nStill by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving Leibniz's law or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, Peter van Inwagen (1990), Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).\n\nIn the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations. The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be \"void for vagueness\" and unenforceable. This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid \"explicit\" or \"objectionable\" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.\n\n\n\n"}
