      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2536">'''Adoxography''' is elegant or refined writing that addresses a trivial or base subject. The term was coined in the late 19th century. It was a form of rhetorical exercise "in which the legitimate methods of the encomium are applied to persons or objects in themselves obviously unworthy of praise, as being trivial, ugly, useless, ridiculous, dangerous or vicious" — see Arthur S. Pease, "Things Without Honor", ''Classical Philology'', Vol. XXI (1926) 27, at 28–9. Pease surveys this field from its origins with the defence of Helen ascribed to Gorgias, and cites De Quincey's "[[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]" and Lewis Carroll’s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' as modern examples. Pease suggests that the skill was taught in ancient Greece, where the matters known to have been praised included gout, blindness, deafness, old age, negligence, adultery, flies, gnats, bedbugs, smoke, and dung. 

The art was rediscovered during the revival of [[rhetoric]] in the 16th century. Among the best known and most influential examples was [[Erasmus]]' ''Moriae Encomium'' or ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''.  

==Literary Examples==
The first English treatise on the subject was Anthony Munday's ''"The defence of contraries"'' (1593), a translation of Charles Estienne's "Paradoxes, ce sont propos contre la commune opinion" and based on Ortensio Landi's "Paradossi". It contained essays that praised, amongst other things, poverty, drunkenness and stupidity.  [[Walter K. Olson]], writing in the Leisure &amp; Arts section of the September 8, 2005, edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', quotes the following passage from Sadakat Kadri, "The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O.J. Simpson": "Elizabethan schoolboys...were commonly taught adoxography, the art of eruditely praising worthless things." The passage comes in the course of an account of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s trial, and Kadri observes that Munday thought [[lawyers]] could particularly learn from his book. This was a period of English history when the jury trial was assuming its modern form, and Kadri later shows that the ability to praise apparently worthless causes has been central to courtroom [[advocacy]] for centuries. Celebrated adoxographers could therefore be said to include men such as [[Cicero]] and [[Clarence Darrow]].

In modern writing, the term "adoxography" is also used as an often humorous self-reference in writing, often in regard to humor columns or blogs.

Between 1890 and 1918, [[Scramble for Africa|Western colonial expansion in Africa]] led to the removal of many pieces of sub-Saharan [[African art]] that were subsequently brought to Europe and displayed.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=Reinventing Africa : museums, material culture and popular imagination in late Victorian and Edwardian England|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068905|edition=2nd pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects entered the collections of natural history museums, art museums (both encyclopedic and specialist) and private collections in Europe and the United States.

==The removal of African artworks from their source countries during the 19th Century==
Before the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, traders and explorers to Africa bought or stole art as souvenirs and [[wikt:curios|curios]],&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim" /&gt; speading beyond the coast; ivory objects made along African coasts had been collected for centuries, and many were made by Africans for European markets in a style matching European taste, mainly in areas reached by the Portuguese, the [[Kongo_ivories#Afro-Portuguese_ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]]. The period dominated by curio collecting, in which objects served as souvenirs, was followed by a period of trophy collecting in which large collections of artifacts (mostly weapons), and animal skins, horns, and tusks from hunting expeditions, were a tangible means of showing penetration, conquest and domination.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scramble for Art in Central Africa|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|editor=Enid Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, thousands of African sculptures arrived in Europe in the aftermath of colonial conquest and exploratory expeditions. They were placed on view in museums such as the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]], founded in 1878 in Paris, and its counterparts in other European cities.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; At the time, these objects were treated as artifacts of colonized cultures rather than as artworks and were very cheap, often sold in flea markets and pawnshops.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences"&gt;{{cite web|last=Denise|first=Murrell|title=African Influences in Modern Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European collections==
[[File:Musée du Congo, Tervuren, Belgium; one of five interior scen Wellcome V0014543.jpg|thumb|Art on display at the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]].]]

The different histories of museums inEurope and the United States affected the collecting and display of African art in both places.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; European museums typically were founded as state institutions and thus their collections and displays were shaped by national interests. The appreciation of African objects purely as fine art in Europe was largely limited to private galleries in the early twentieth century. In Paris, dealers such [[Paul Guillaume]], [[Charles Ratton]] and [[Louis Carre]] played a role in the formation of major private collections of African art. The latter half of the twentieth century saw the opening of the first European art museums devoted to collecting and displaying African art, including the [[Barbier-Mueller Museum|Musee Barbier-Mueller]] in Geneva (1977), the [[Musee Dapper]] in Paris (1986),&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; but many if not most general national art museums by then had collections.

===Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium===
In 1897, [[King Leopold II]] took advantage of the [[Brussels International Exhibition]] in [[Tervuren]] to promote his holdings of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. The [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 International Exhibition]] piqued scientific interest in the people and animals of Central Africa, thus King Leopold II decided to build on his promotion of Congo. The [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] was established in 1898 as a permanent museum and scientific institution responsible for mounting exhibitions for the Belgian public and encouraging the study of Central Africa.&lt;ref name="Royal Museum for Central Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From Congo Museum to RMCA|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/museum/about-us/museum/history/Congomuseum|work=Royal Museum for Central Africa|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Museum===

The Sainsbury African Galleries in the [[British Museum]] in London display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. 

Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler from [[Ife]], the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], Asante goldwork from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].


The [[Benin Bronzes]] were seized by a [[United Kingdom|British]] force in the [[Benin Expedition of 1897]] and given to the British [[Foreign Office]]. As Paula Girshick Ben-Amos, a professor of anthropology and African Studies at Indiana University, states in The Art of Benin, “art of the Benin Kingdom came to public and scholarly attention in the West in 1897 when members of a British Punitive Expedition brought out thousands of objects as war booty.”2

Around 200 of the bronzes were passed on to the British Museum, while the remainder were divided among a variety of collections, with the majority being purchased by [[Felix von Luschan]] on behalf of the ''Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde'' in [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnological Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Luschan|first=Feliz|title=Die Altertümer von Benin|year=1919|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Oba [[Akenzua II]] began the movement to return the corpus of objects now known in modern discourse as the 'Benin Bronzes'.

===Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro===
The Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro was the first [[Anthropology|anthropological]] museum in Paris, founded in 1878. It closed in 1935 when the building that housed it, the [[Trocadéro#The old Palais du Trocadéro|Trocadéro Palace]], was demolished; its descendant is the [[Musée de l'Homme]], housed in the [[Trocadéro#The new Palais de Chaillot|Palais de Chaillot]] on the same site, and its French collections formed the nucleus of the [[Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (France)|Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires]], also in the Palais de Chaillot. Numerous [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists discovered African art at the Trocadéro Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Crespelle, ''The Fauves'', tr. Anita Brookner, Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=fLIcTrzKNJOssAPtgrmhBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=yxcOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Fauves+Trocad%C3%A9ro&amp;q=In+1904%2C+the+two+had+been+in+the+habit+of+visiting+the+Trocadero+Museum+%E2%80%94+ancestor+of+the+Musee+de+I%27Homme+%E2%80%94+to+look+at+the+African+and+Polynesian+collections.+They+regarded+them+simply+as+curiosities%2C+and+it+was+not+until#search_anchor p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso said that this art taught him "what painting was all about", seeing it in the museum's African masks, which had been created "as a kind of mediation between [humanity] and the unknown hostile forces that [surround us]",&lt;ref name=Gilot266&gt;Françoise Gilot and Carlton Lake, ''Life with Picasso'', 1964, repr. New York: Anchor/Doubleday, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-385-26186-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=9eEZTuqRHoiisAPa8fDPDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=8TfYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Picasso+depressed+Gilot&amp;q=Trocadero#search_anchor p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt;  and to have been influenced by the masks in the forms of the figures in [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which eventually led to Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;According to Christopher Green, ''Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo'', New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-300-10412-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e2V5dnM_x4UC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51] this is "generally accepted" although denied by Picasso himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur I. Miller]], ''Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc'', New York: Basic, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01859-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VEPaSUitrDkC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]: [A]lthough the sharp change in the right-hand demoiselles occurred after Picasso's visit to Trocadéro, . . . . [i]t turns out that African art supported his conceptual approach and convinced him of the deep meaning of geometry as the language of the new art."&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the African collection has since been transferred to the [[Musee du Quai Branly]].

==African art in ethnological collections==
[[File:Drum - Kongo - Royal Museum for Central Africa - DSC05703.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Kongo people|Kongo]] drum in the ethnographic collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa.]]
Initially, all African art objects were viewed as [[ethnographic]] specimens.  Notably, during the period of 1890 through 1913, all large museums redefined their public image in terms of an educational prerogative.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997" /&gt; In response to the debate around the use of the terms ''curio'' and ''curiosity'', the League of the Empire in 1904 recommended the "orderly arrangement and the transformation of mere curios into objects of scientific interest by appropriate classification."{{Ref|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Museums Journal|date=September 1904|volume=4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as a means of validating the expansion of ethnographic collections, the rhetoric often employed was one of the necessity of conservation and preservation in the face of the inevitable extinction of the producers of the materials culture in their custody (121).

[[Stewart Culin]], curator at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the first American curator to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens, which he did in 1923. Culin distinguished his installation from those of contemporaneous ethnological collections at institutions such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in saying that "the objects of Negro art which are displayed publicly form part of museum collections of African ethnology and receive no special attention at the hands of ethnologists... In the majority of these collections their artistic significance is obscured by the wealth of material, and lost, not infrequently, in the efforts made for its elucidation."&lt;ref name="Culin 1923"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culin|first=Stewart|title=Negro art|journal=Brooklyn Museum Quarterly|year=1923|volume=10|issue=3|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639|author2=Dumouchelle, Kevin D. (contributions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Art/Artifact'', an exhibition organized by [[Susan Vogel]] in 1988, presented 160 objects of art and ethnography selected from the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], the [[Hampton University Museum]] (Virginia), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (New York City). All three are anthropology museums founded in the 1860s with distinguished African collections. The exhibition examined the shifting definitions of art and artifact, and dealt with the question of how we look at objects from traditional African cultures whose classification systems differ from contemporary Western culture.

==African art and Western Modernism==
During the early 1900s, the aesthetics of traditional African sculpture became a powerful influence among European artists who formed an avant-garde in the development of modern art, known as the "[[Primitivism]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; In France, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and their [[School of Paris]] friends blended the highly stylized treatment of the human figure in African sculptures with painting styles derived from the [[post-Impressionist]] works of [[Cézanne]] and [[Gauguin]]. The resulting pictorial flatness, vivid color palette, and fragmented [[Cubist]] shapes helped to define early [[modernism]]. While these artists knew nothing of the original meaning and function of the West and Central African sculptures they encountered, they claimed to instantly recognize the spiritual aspect of the composition and to adapt these qualities to their own efforts to move beyond the naturalism that had defined Western art since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

[[German Expressionist]] painters such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] of [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) group, based in [[Dresden]] and [[Berlin]], conflated African aesthetics with the emotional intensity of dissonant color tones and figural distortion, to depict the anxieties of modern life, while [[Paul Klee]] of the [[Blaue Reiter]] (Blue Rider) in [[Munich]] developed transcendent symbolic imagery.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; The Expressionists' interest in non-Western art intensified after a 1910 [[Gauguin]] exhibition in [[Dresden]], while modernist movements in Italy, England, and the United States initially engaged with African art through contacts with School of Paris artists. These [[avant-garde]] artists, their dealers, and leading critics of the era were among the first Europeans to collect African sculptures for their aesthetic value.

==American collections==
The 1913 [[Armory Show]] marked a seminal moment for America’s [[avant-garde]]. An exposition of about 1,300 works, it introduced the New York art audience to movements like [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]] and [[Futurism]], as well as the work of European artists including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The Armory Show and its promotion of [[Modernism]] also helped create a taste and a market for African art in New York.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

Notably, in 1914 two New York galleries introduced African sculpture to their audiences: [[Robert J. Coady]]’s newly opened [[Washington Square Gallery]] and [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s well-established [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]. Stieglitz’s held an exhibition in 1914 dedicated entirely to African artifacts as works of art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room" /&gt;

New York City progressively positioned itself as a central marketplace for African art.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; During the years 1915-19, American dealers began promoting African objects as art to a growing group of collectors. Among the dealers, Mexican artist [[Marius de Zayas]] (1880–1961) was largely responsible for helping some adventurous modern-art collectors, including [[Walter Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], and Agnes and [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], to build their African art collections. During the early 1920s, several American institutions began opening their doors to African art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibition Tells Story of How African Artifacts Were First Recognized as Art in U.S.|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/african-art-new-york-and-the-avant-garde|work=Press Room|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brooklyn Museum===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 69.133.5 Mask.jpg|thumb|upright|A mask of the [[We people]] at the Brooklyn Museum.]]
In 1903, [[Stewart Culin]] (1858–1929) became the founding curator of the Department of Ethnology at the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, now the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009" /&gt;  Culin, a self-taught ethnologist, built the foundation of four curatorial collections for the Museum, acquiring objects representing African, Asian, Native American, and Eastern European cultures. Culin was among the first curators to recognize museum installation as an art form. He was also among the first to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens. This approach is evidenced in his exhibition "Primitive Negro Art, Chiefly from the Belgian Congo". The exhibition opened in April 1923, and displayed African objects he had acquired in Europe from dealers.

===Barnes Foundation===
[[Albert C. Barnes|Albert Barnes]] was one of the first American collectors to selectively acquire an extensive collection of African sculpture purely on aesthetic merits. In 1923, two years before the [[Barnes Foundation]] opening in [[Merion]], Pennsylvania, Barnes wrote, "When the foundation opens, negro art will have a place among the great manifestations of all times."&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Barnes to Paul Guillaume, November 5, 1923, the Barnes Foundation Archives, Merion, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his active promotion of the foundation's collection of African sculpture and its aesthetic importance, Barnes himself played a critical role in fostering appreciation of African art in the United States in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

===Museum of Primitive Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art===

Founded in 1954 by [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] and [[Rene d'Harnoncourt]], the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] was the first art museum exclusively devoted to exhibiting and collecting works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas for their aesthetic value rather than as ethnographic documents or colonial trophies.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Representing Africa in American art museums : a century of collecting and display|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295989617|authorlink=Collecting African Art at New York's Museum of Primitive Art|editor=Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Christa Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum closed in 1974, and its collection, staff and library were transferred to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] according to an agreement made between Rockefeller and the Met in 1969. The Museum of Primitive Art was in many ways an outgrowth of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA).&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt;  It was located directly behind MoMA and was also built on Rockefeller-owned property. Rockefeller was MoMA's president and d'Harnoncourt was its director. MoMA's 1935 landmark exhibition African Negro Art was influential in shaping the director of the Museum of Primitive Art.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt; Today, the Museum of Primitive Art collection is housed in the Metropolitan Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.

===National Museum of African Art===
The [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington D.C. was founded by [[Warren M. Robbins]] in 1964 as a private and relatively small collection. In 1979 the collection, by then about 8,000 objects, was taken over by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is now housed in a central if underground location on the [[National Mall]].

==Problems of display==
Many scholars and curators have debated the efficacy of different modes of display of African art in Western museums. Generally, scholars agree that the Western art museum was, and continues to be, incompatible with the contexts from which most traditional [[African arts]] emerged. The following quotation from Kathleen Bickford Berzock and Christa Clarke's introduction to their book ''Representing Africa in American Art Museum'' summarizes the reasons for this incompatibility:

{{quote|text="Art museums reinforced hierarchies of value based on media or genre, favoring paintings and sculpture created solely for artistic appreciation. In contrast, the visual arts of Africa encompass not only sculpture in wood and metal but also beadwork, textiles, basketry, and other works of diverse media, all of which may hold equal value for their creators. And while aesthetics may guide the production of art in Africa, often there are other social, religious, or political concerns that inform its design and use. With this range of forms and materials and the different circumstances of creation and use within society, the diverse arts of Africa were not suited to the aesthetic hierarchies and systems of classification established by art museums. Moreover, museum practices of collecting and display emphasized the artist as individual genius, the school of artists working in a similar style and vein, and chronology. Such categorization was not easily replicated with African objects, which were often collected with fragmentary documentation that rarely identified the individual artist or the specific time period of creation."&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berzock|first=Kathleen Bickford|title=Representing Africa in American Art Museums|year=2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle &amp; London|pages=3–19|authorlink=A Historical Introduction|author2=Christa Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Post-1980s African Art==
Post-1980s [[curator]]ial approaches to collecting and displaying historical African art tend towards greater specialization, broadening definitions, and a desire for contextualization.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

Curatorial debate surrounds questions about where boundaries should be drawn between traditional and modern, between African and the [[African diaspora]] in the Americas and Europe, and between [[sub-Saharan]] and [[North African]] art. In certain instances, tradition-based and contemporary works have been exhibited together, a practice that began with the exhibition "Astonishment and Power: Kingo Minkisi &amp; the Art of Renee Stout" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Atwood ARTnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Atwood|first=Roger|title=African Art: Beyond the Masks|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/17/beyond-the-masks/|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=ARTnews|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this exhibition was criticized for suggesting a cultural continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today while ignoring crucial cultural differences between these two bodies of work.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=ART VIEW; Art That's Valued for What It Can Do|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/art-view-art-that-s-valued-for-what-it-can-do.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Benin]] artist [[Meschac Gaba]]'s installation "Museum of Contemporary African Art" at [[Tate Modern]] belies the fact that there is no such thing as a museum of [[contemporary African art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Contemporary African Art|url=http://www.museumofcontemporaryafricanart.com/entree.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
:1.{{Note|1}}In 1903, the League of the Empire was founded in England with the aim of bringing children from different parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] into contact with one another through correspondence, lectures and exchanges. A distinguished group of museum directors and officials headed a sub-committee of the League entitled 'School Museum Committee.'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">'''Atticism''' (meaning "favouring [[Attica]]", the region of [[Athens]] in [[Greece]]) was a [[rhetoric]]al movement that began in the first quarter of the 1st century BC; it may also refer to the wordings and phrasings typical of this movement, in contrast with various contemporary forms of Koine [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] (both literary and vulgar), which continued to evolve in directions guided by the common usages of [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] Greek.

Atticism was portrayed as a return to Classical methods after what was perceived as the pretentious style of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Sophist]] rhetoric and called for a return to the approaches of the [[Attic orators]].

Although the plainer language of Atticism eventually became as belabored and ornate as the [[peroration]]s it sought to replace, its original simplicity meant that it remained universally comprehensible throughout the Greek world. This helped maintain vital cultural links across the [[Mediterranean]] and beyond. Admired and popularly imitated writers such as [[Lucian]] also adopted Atticism, so that the style survived until the [[Renaissance era|Renaissance]], when it was taken up by non-[[Greek people|Greek]] students of [[Byzantine]] expatriates. [[Renaissance]] scholarship, the basis of modern scholarship in the west, nurtured strong Classical and Attic views, continuing Atticism for another four centuries.

Represented at its height by rhetoricians such as [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], and grammarians such as [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]] and [[Phrynichus Arabius]] at [[Alexandria]], this tendency prevailed from the 1st century BC onward, and with the force of an ecclesiastical dogma controlled all subsequent Greek culture, even so that the living form of the Greek language, even then being transformed into modern Greek much later, was quite obscured and only occasionally found expression, chiefly in private documents, though also in popular literature.

For instance, there were literary writers such as [[Strabo]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Josephus]] who intentionally withdrew from this way of expression ([[classical Greek]]) in favor of the common form of Greek.

In painting, the so-called "Parisian Atticism" is a particular movemement in French painting of the 17th century, spanning approximatively between 1640 and 1660, when famous painters working in Paris like [[Eustache Le Sueur]] or [[Jacques Stella]] elaborated a rigorous classicist style, characterized by a research of sobriety, luminosity and harmony and references to the Greco-Roman world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9800">The term '''Bible fiction''' refers to works of [[fiction]] which use characters, settings and events taken from the [[Bible]]. The degree of fictionalization in these works varies and, although they are often written by [[Christian]]s or [[Jew]]s, this is not always the case.

Originally, these novels were consistent with true belief in the historicity of the Bible's narrative, replete with miracles, and God's explicit presence.  Some of these works have been important and influential, and eventually there have appeared heterodox Bible novels that reflect [[modernism|modern]], [[postmodern]] or [[realism (arts)|realist]] influences and themes.

An early Bible novel that may still be the most influential is ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' by [[Lew Wallace]], and published by Harper &amp; Brothers on November 12, 1880.  It remained the best-selling American novel of all time, surpassing [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) in sales and remaining at the top of the US all-time bestseller list until the publication of [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1936). ''Ben-Hur'' is a [[bildungsroman]] and adventure novel that follows the tumultuous life of its protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur. He is a fictional Jewish noble from Jerusalem who suffers betrayal (by a boyhood friend) and consequently his enslavement and his family's imprisonment by the Romans.  Concurrent with Judah's narrative is the developing Christian story, as Jesus and Judah are natives of the same region and about the same age. Judah survives his ordeal and becomes a famous soldier and charioteer, enabling him to avenge his misfortune.  Judah's encounters with Jesus first during Judah's and then during Jesus' suffering lead to the Messiah's curing of Judah's sister and mother of leprosy and Judah's conversion to Christianity. There have been numerous film adaptations including the 1959 version starring [[Charlton Heston]] that won ten academy awards.

''[[The Robe]]'' (1942) by [[Lloyd C. Douglas]] was one of the best-selling novels of the 1940s and dramatizes the crucifixion of Jesus from the point of view of Marcellus Gallio, the Roman tribune who commands the garrison that carries out the crucifixion of Jesus. Marcellus winds up in custody of Jesus' robe and converts to Christianity because of his experiences interacting with the robe's magical powers.  Like ''Ben-Hur'', ''The Robe'' was in 1953 adapted into an Academy Award winning film.

In the twentieth century, there began to appear heterodox Bible fiction.  [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]' ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1960), caused a widespread outcry and appeared on many banned book lists for its dramatization of Jesus as wracked by temptations, beset by fear, doubts, depression, reluctance and lust.  However, Jesus is nevertheless portrayed as a miracle-worker and the son of God who is resurrected following the crucifixion.  [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Gospel According to the Son]]'' (1997) is a retelling in Mailer's own words that adheres closely to the Gospel narrative including miracles and resurrection.  This was noteworthy in part because Mailer was a Jew, not a Christian.

[[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ]]'' (2010) is a heavily allegorical retelling of the Christian story that uses postmodern techniques and is an evident polemic against Christianity.  It retells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, brothers, "Jesus" and "Christ," with contrasting personalities:  Jesus is a moral and spiritual man, and his brother Christ is an ambitious character who wishes to hijack Jesus' biography and legacy to develop a myth that will be the foundation for a powerful and worldly Church.

Other works are regarded as heterodox simply because they dramatize the Bible stories realistically, shorn of mythical, miraculous or magical elements.  They may even include the transformation from real life events to mythology as part of the narrative.  Realist Bible novels are typically semi-historical in that they develop the setting in Israel or Egypt or Rome or as the case may be—including the political and class and racial conflicts and urban and rural landscape imagery—with fidelity to known historical facts. As [[Robert Graves]] said of his novel ''[[King Jesus]]'' (1946), "I undertake to my readers that every important element in my story is based on some tradition, however tenuous, and that I have taken more than ordinary pains to verify my historical background."

Realist Bible novels employ in some way the narratives that comprise the canonical Biblical narrative, but shorn of miracles, or God's explicit presence.  With respect to Jesus' biography, Jesus is portrayed as a man, usually a rebel against the wealthy classes (sometimes he himself is born into a privileged background and rebels against his own class), and the ruling Romans and their local client autocrats.   Sometimes Jesus' biography is enhanced by sources external to the canonical gospels such as Josephus' chronicles, the Talmud, or non-canonical gospels, and the author's imagination.

Graves' ''King Jesus'' develops the protagonist as, not the son of God, but rather as a philosopher with a legitimate claim to be the earthly king of the Jews as a descendant of Herod the Great, and the Old Testament's David.  The novel has heterodox retellings of Biblical stories.

''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' (1943) is a novel by [[Thomas Mann]] that retells the familiar stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph, setting it in the historical context of the Amarna Period. Mann considered it his greatest work.

''[[The Red Tent (Anita Diamant novel)|The Red Tent]]'' (1997) a novel by [[Anita Diamant]], is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and sister of Joseph.  Diamont has broadened her character from her minor and brief role in the Bible.  The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, as dictated by ancient law, be quarantined while menstruating or giving birth. There the women find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts.

[[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]]' ''[[The Secret Chord]]'' (2015) is narrated by Natan, the prophet who communicates God's directives to David.  The scriptures are her primary sources for the plot, which includes all the well-known key events: Goliath, David's facility with the harp, kingdom building, Bathsheba, and so on.  There are other characters fully developed from Brooks' imagination and portrayed through Natan's point of view.

''[[The Testament of Mary]]'' (2012) a novella by [[Colm Toibin]], is a retelling of the Christian story from the point of view of Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, she does not believe Jesus is the Son of God – she knows he is a man – and she is contemptuous of the Gospel writers who visit her to solicit her cooperation and give her food and shelter. The themes or questions that the novel explores are narrative truth and fiction, feminism, loss, identity and corruption thereof, invasion of privacy, and worldly ambition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/the-testament-of-mary-by-colm-toibin.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Testament of Mary'' was adapted into a Broadway play.

''The Liars' Gospel'' (2012), by Jewish author [[Naomi Alderman]], retells the Christ story from a Jewish perspective.  Four witnesses to the key events, Mary, Judas, Caiaphas and Barabbas, are the narrators in four sections of the novel, and the story spans the period from Pompey's siege of Jerusalem in 63 BC through Titus's siege in 70 AD.

''John the Baptizer'' (2009), by Brooks Hansen and published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], is a novelized life of John the Baptist that dramatizes the man beneath the hagiography. According to Christian theology, John was merely a forerunner to Christ, but Hansen's portrait is strongly influenced by the Gnostic teachings that reveal John as a messianic figure at the center of a sect called the Mandeans, and more mature, rigorous and restrained than his younger and charismatic protégé Jesus.

''Logos'' (2015), a novel by John Neeleman and published by Homebound Publications, a [[small press]], and winner of an [[Independent Publisher Book Awards]] gold medal for religious fiction and the Utah Book Award for fiction,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utahhumanities.org/index.php/Center-for-the-Book/utah-book-award.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a bildungsroman that follows the life and development of the anonymous author of the original gospel.  Jacob, a former temple priest in Jerusalem who has been rendered bereft by the Jewish wars and consequent destruction of his family and culture, is inspired by his own autobiography and Paul's mythmaking to create the canonical gospels' original narrative.

''The Gospel According to Lazarus'' (2019), a novel by [[Richard Zimler]], expands upon the story of [[Lazarus of Bethany]], who was raised from the dead in the [[Gospel of John]]. According to Zimler, one of the objectives of his novel was to return to the New Testament figures their [[Judaism]], so in his narrative, Jesus is called Yeshua ben Yosef and Lazarus is called Eliezer ben Natan. Yeshua and Eliezer have been best friends from childhood, and Yeshua is characterized as a [[Merkabah]] mystic.  The themes of the book include how we cope with a loss of faith, the terrible sacrifices we make for those we love, the transcendent meaning of Yeshua's mission, and how we go on after suffering a shattering trauma.

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.

These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know?

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R.

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27199">{{Main article|Characteristics of Harold Pinter's work#"Comedy of menace"}}
'''Comedy of menace''' is the body of plays written by [[David Campton]], [[Nigel Dennis]], [[N. F. Simpson]], and [[Harold Pinter]].  The term was coined by drama critic [[Irving Wardle]], who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'', in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in ''[[Encore (magazine)|Encore]]'' in 1958.  (Campton's subtitle ''Comedy of Menace'' is a jocular play-on-words derived from ''[[comedy of manners]]''—''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;See Merritt 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240, 310, and 326, citing articles by Wardle, Gussow's ''Conversations with Pinter'', and various performance reviews by Wardle, Gussow, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Citing Wardle's original publications in ''Encore'' magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in "Comedy of Menace" Wardle "first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the "non-naturalists" or "abstractionists"&amp;nbsp;' (28)" (Merritt 225).  His article "Comedy of Menace," Merritt continues,
&lt;blockquote&gt;centers on ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of "descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, '[[The Room (play)|The Room]]' and '[[The Dumb Waiter]]', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb" (33).  Mentioning the acknowledged "literary influences" on Pinter's work—"Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films"—Wardle argues that "&amp;nbsp;'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article." (225)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] Billington 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Comedy of Menace", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of ''The Birthday Party'' and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that "Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff"; he suggests how "menace" in Pinter's plays "stands for something more substantial: destiny," and that destiny, "handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction" (Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33; rpt. in ''The Encore Reader'' 91).

"Just two years later" (1960), however, Wardle retracted "Comedy of Menace" in his review of ''[[The Caretaker]]'', stating: "On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing.  I now take it back" ("There's Music" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).

After Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet").  For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about ''[[Old Times]]'', [[Mel Gussow]] recalled that "After ''[[The Homecoming]]'' [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out.  ''[[Landscape]]'' and ''[[Silence]]'' [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between ''The Homecoming'' and ''Old Times''] are in a very different form.  There isn't any menace at all.'&amp;nbsp;"  Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had "tired" of "menace", Pinter added: "when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin.  I never thought of menace myself.  It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958].  I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights].  But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration" (Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 18, 24).

Despite Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' (and Pinter's later qualifications), ''Comedy of menace'' and ''comedies of menace'' caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;  As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 "conversation" with Pinter, "Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using ''comedy of menace'' when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of ''The Birthday Party''.  While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).

==Selected examples from Pinter's plays and sketches==
&lt;!--See Wikified links to articles on the plays for further details and interpretations of their elements of comedy and menace and critical references.--&gt;
;''The Birthday Party'' (1958)

In discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' (1958), which followed his first play, ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' (1957), his authorised official biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] points out that Wardle "once excellently" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as "a banal living-room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history" (Billington 86).

;''The Dumb Waiter'' (1960)

In his second one-act play, ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by [[Martin McDonagh]] closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, ''[[In Bruges]]'', "Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of [[music hall|music-hall]] cross-talk and the urban thriller: [[Hackney Empire]] cross-fertilises with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]'' [1927]" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with [[Franz Kafka]] (348–49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Webster]], and [[Cyril Tourneur]], whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; [[Samuel Beckett]] (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=WardleinMerritt&gt;See Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33, as qtd. in Merritt 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority," according to Billington, ''The Dumb Waiter'' focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is "the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning"; Ben, "the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk.  (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)" (92).  As Pinter's ''The Dumb Waiter'' has been categorised as a "comedy of menace," so may be  McDonagh's ''In Bruges'', as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also "doing something which can be described as political" (92).  At the same time, [Pinter] had – and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy" (92).

The "punning title" of ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "carries several layers of meaning": "It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen"—the [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]]; "But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability" (89).  As Gus "dumbly" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the "senior partner" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to [[The powers that be (phrase)|The Powers That Be]], a contemporary variation on [[Deus ex machina]], manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient "orders" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them.

Billington adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness.  You can interpret it as an [[Theatre of the absurd|Absurdist comedy]] – a kind of ''[[Waiting for Godot|Godot]]'' in [[Birmingham]] – about two men passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose.  You can see it as a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His plaything – even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the door have been invested with religious significance [by critics].  But it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership.  Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority ''and'' a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, [[talking past each other]] and raking over old times. (90)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy in this "comedy of menace" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when "Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle," a "semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy": "All the great stage and film double acts – [[Jimmy Jewel|Jewel]] and [[Ben Warriss|Warriss]], [[Abbott and Costello]] – fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner" —
&lt;blockquote&gt;
GUS: Light what?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: The kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You mean the gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: Who does?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You do.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''his eyes narrowing''): What do you mean, I mean the gas?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''Powerfully''): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: How can you light a kettle?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle.  It's a figure of speech! (Qtd. in Billington 90–91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Billington observes further,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great [[Sid Field]] – ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by [[Jerry Desmonde]]'s golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When I say "Slowly Back" I don't mean "Slowly Back", I mean "Slowly Back."&amp;nbsp;' At another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure.  … The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage. (91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Everything" in ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "contributes towards a necessary end"; for, "the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] ''[[The Dwarfs (novel)|The Dwarfs]]'', stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea" (91).  In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while "despatching ever more unlikely orders," serves as "both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority" (91), and therein lies its menace.  When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their "routine" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to "take out" his "gun" (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 114–15):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"BEN ''frowns and presses his forehead''.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've missed something out.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  I know.  What?&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  You take your gun out—&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  After I've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  After you've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've never missed that out before, you know that?&lt;br&gt;
(Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 116)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when "Gus enters through the door stage-right – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster"; it becomes clear that ''he'' is going to be "Ben's target" (Billington 92), as Ben's "''revolver [is] levelled at the door''", though the play ends ''before'' Ben fires any shot (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 121).

;''The Caretaker'' (1960)

In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of World Drama]]'' cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: [[Franz Kafka]], American gangster films, and [[Samuel Beckett]]. . . . At that time his plays, more than those of any other plawright's {{sic}}, were responsible for the newly coined term 'comedy of menace.'  This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' . . . or to ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]''. . . . But 'menace' is hardly the word for ''[[The Caretaker]]'', and still less for subsequent plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down-and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657–58).  (Qtd. in Merritt 240)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to ''The Caretaker''—only the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) —and to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of ''The Caretaker'' in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, ''The Caretaker'' 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage.

The comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his "deepest wishes" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that "if" he can "just get down to Sidcup" to get his "papers" and "sort" himself "out" (113–16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175–79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and "decorate the attic room out for [Mick]" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as "an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator" (172–74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and-out Davies before Mick (and the audience).

Pinter's friend the late film and stage director [[David Jones (director)|David Jones]], who directed the play for the [[Roundabout Theatre]], in [[New York City]], in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of ''[[Betrayal (1983 film)|Betrayal]]'', as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that ''The Caretaker'' is only "funny, up to a point" and that "beyond that point" is why he wrote it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it." (Jones)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Beyond the point" of the comedy (the "funny") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have "labeled" or "pigeonholed" (depending on one's perspective) as "menace" (Merritt 9–10).

;Pinter's later plays

Though "comedy of menace" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]'' (1961), ''[[The Lover (play)|The Lover]]'' (1963), ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'' (1965, 1968), and ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996) and ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in ''Ashes to Ashes'', in which heavy echoes of the [[Holocaust]] predominate; a more comedy than menace in ''Celebration'', where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible.

;''Celebration'' (2000)

While reviewers and other audience members describe ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' as hilarious ("one of Pinter's funniest plays", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on [[The Ivy]], in London's [[West End (London)|West End]]) – "this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe" (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364) – remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as "a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family" (405).

One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104).

As the "''maître d'hôtel''" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem ("I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that [[public house]] of my childhood" [Pinter, ''Celebration'' 371]), the "''maîtress d'hôtel''" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74), while the Waiter engages in "interjections" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375).

Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies ("[[Teddy boys]]", according to some London reviews)—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Lambert's [[mobile phone]] rings''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT  Who the fuck's this?&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it on''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.)  Yes? What? (''He listens briefly''.)  I said no calls! It's my fucking wedding anniversary!&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it off''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.) Cunt.&lt;br&gt;  (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364)—&lt;/blockquote&gt;
who describe themselves as "consultants … Strategy consultants. … It means we don't carry guns.  … We don't have to! … We're peaceful strategy consultants. … Worldwide.  Keeping the peace (379). ''Strategy consultant'' could be a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] catchall for  warmonger, manager of [[terrorism]], purveyor of [[counter-terrorism]], or orderer of [[covert operations]].

As the banker Russell interprets their explanation, ''peaceful strategy consultants'' seems vaguely menacing: "We need more people like you.  Taking responsibility.  Taking charge.  Keeping the peace.  Enforcing the peace.  Enforcing peace.  We need more like you" (379).  This speech stressing "force" (in the repetitions of ''Enforcing'') occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look at me.  I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people would describe me as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].  (''to Suki'') Am I right?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
RUSSELL  But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no psychopathic tendencies at all.  I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse.  I feel something quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow diners.  Now this is very unusual for me.  Normally I feel—as I've just said—absoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance—but here I feel love. How do you explain it?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  It's the ambience. (370–71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from ''The Dumb Waiter''; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog.  One imagines such characters 
"strategically" plotting the "peaceful" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping [[Perrier]] and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their [[Mobile phone|mobiles]].

As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate "interjection", in which one might detect intimations of mortality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it.  I can't find the door to get out.  My grandfather got out of it.  He left it behind him and he didn't look back.&lt;br&gt;
He got that absolutely right.&lt;br&gt;
And I'd like to make one further interjection.&lt;br&gt;
''He stands still''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Slow fade''.&lt;br&gt;
(385)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;"Apart From That" (Sketch) (2006)

Pinter mocks [[mobile phone]]s comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch ''[[Apart From That (sketch)|Apart From That]]'' (2006).  As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is "very funny", but "as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clichéd chat" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Two people on mobile phones''.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
How are you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Very well.  And you? Are you well?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm terribly well.  How about you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Really well.  I'm really well.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm so glad.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I do know. But apart from that ...?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
How about you?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Oh you know ... all things considered ...&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.  But apart from that ...?&lt;br /&gt;
''Silence''.&lt;br /&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Sorry. I've lost you.&lt;br&gt;
[....]
("Apart From That" 5–6)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{wiktionary|connoisseur}}
A '''connoisseur''' ([[French language|French]] [[Reforms of French orthography|traditional]] (pre-1835) spelling of ''connaisseur'', from Middle-French ''connoistre'', then ''connaître'' meaning "to be acquainted with" or "to know somebody/something.") is a person who has a great deal of [[knowledge]] about the [[fine arts]], [[cuisine]]s, or an expert judge in matters of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]].  In many areas the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly [[irony|ironic]] sense, but in the [[art trade]] connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique, where documentary evidence of [[provenance]] is lacking.  The situation in the [[wine trade]] is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through [[wine tasting]].

==Connoisseurship in art==
"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined [...] as connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorynews.com/articles/1101_On_connoisseurship |title=On Connoisseurship| first=Bendor| last=Grosvenor |website=Arthistorynews.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connoisseurs evaluate works of [[art]] on the basis of their experience of the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique of artists. Judgment informed by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of [[empirical evidence]], refinement of [[perception]] about [[wikt:technique|technique]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to [[:wikt:attribute|attribute]] [[authorship]], validate [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the [[art valuation|valuation of works]], and can be collected and organized into a ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of the work of a single [[artist]] or a [[art school|school]].

In his ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (1955), [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains the difference between a connoisseur and an [[art historian]]: "The connoisseur might be defined as a [[laconic]] art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur."

The English dealer and art historian, [[Philip Mould]] says, "it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/moversshakers/qa-bbcs-art-sleuth-philip-mould/1469.article |title=Interview by Gabriella Griffith |publisher=Londonlovesbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Detective|first=Philip|last=Mould|date=2009|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague, [[Bendor Grosvenor]] takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment.&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"/&gt; [[Svetlana Alpers]] confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Alpers|Alpers, Svetlana]], "Style is What You Make It", p. 139, in ''The Concept of Style'', ed. Berel Lang, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 137-162, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hgiUuMCOmOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Concept+of+Style,+ed.+Berel+Lang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXY8Ue2pAcSS7Ab5q4HgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Concept%20of%20Style%2C%20ed.%20Berel%20Lang&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, [[Christie's]] Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.edu/ny_ma_modconnhist.html |title=Christie's MA course components |publisher=Christies.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers "the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists’ studios, conservation labs and museums."

===Earlier views of connoisseurship===
During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend [[critic]].

In 1760, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] said, "[[Painting]] is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour."

In 1890, [[Giovanni Morelli]] wrote, "art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art."

The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995).

==Connoisseurs in other fields==
Connoisseur is also used in the context of [[gastronomy]], i.e. in connection with fine [[food]], [[beer]], [[wine]], [[tea]] and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Connaisseur|"Connaisseur" in its original French]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/Connaisseur |title='Connaisseur' in the '&amp;#39;Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'&amp;#39;, 3rd meaning |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ecological anthropology''' is a sub-field of [[anthropology]] and is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|pages=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their [[culture]] to maintain their [[ecosystems]]".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Ecological anthropology developed from the approach of [[cultural ecology]], and it provided a [[conceptual framework]] more suitable for [[scientific inquiry]] than the cultural ecology approach.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and nature : an introduction to human ecological relations|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-0572-9|pages=31–32|edition=3. [repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research pursued under this approach aims to study a wide range of human responses to [[environmental problems]].&lt;ref name="Moran"/&gt;

== History of the domain and leading researchers ==

In the 1960s, ecological anthropology first appeared as a response to cultural ecology, a sub-field of anthropology led by [[Julian Steward]].  Steward focused on studying different modes of subsistence as methods of [[energy transfer]] and then analyzed how they determine other aspects of culture.  Culture became the [[unit of analysis]].  The first ecological anthropologists explored the idea that humans as ecological [[population]]s should be the unit of analysis, and culture became the means by which that population alters and adapts to the environment.  It was characterised by [[systems theory]], [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] and [[negative feedback]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kottak|first=Conrad P.|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 1999|volume=101|issue=1|pages=23–35|jstor=683339|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/66329/1/aa.1999.101.1.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/orlove/orlove.htm Benjamin S. Orlove] has noted that the development of ecological anthropology has occurred in stages. "Each stage is a reaction to the previous one rather than merely an addition to it".&lt;ref name="Orlove"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orlove|first=Benjamin S.|title=Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1980|volume=9|pages=235–273|jstor=2155736|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.09.100180.001315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage concerns the work of Julian Steward and [[Leslie White]], the second stage is titled '[[neofunctionalism]]' and/or '[[neoevolutionism]]', and the third stage is termed 'processual ecological anthropology'.&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; During the first stage, two different models were developed by both White and Steward.  "The distinction is not as rigid as some critics have made it out to be, White's models of [[cultural evolution]] were [[unilinear]] and monocausal, whereas Steward admitted a number of different lines of [[cultural development]] and a number of different causal factors.&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; During the second stage, it was noted that the later group agreed with Steward and White, while the other disagreed. 'Neoevolutionists' borrowed from the work of [[Charles Darwin]]. The general approach suggested that "evolution is progressive and leads towards new and better forms in succeeding periods".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; 'Neofunctionalists' "see the social organization and culture of specific populations as functional adaptations which permit the populations to exploit their environments successfully without exceeding their carrying capacity".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; 'Processual ecological anthropology' is noted to be new. Studies based on this approach "seek to overcome the split in the second stage of ecological anthropology between excessively short and long time scales".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; The approach more specifically, examines "shifts and changes in individual and group activities, and they focus on the mechanism by which behavior and external constraints influence each other".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt;

One of the leading practitioners within this sub-field of anthropology was [[Roy Rappaport]]. He delivered many outstanding works on the relationship between culture and the natural environment in which it grows, especially concerning the role of [[ritual]] in the processual relationship between the two. He conducted the majority, if not all, of his fieldwork amongst a group known as the [[Maring (Papua New Guinea)|Maring]], who inhabit an area in the highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

[[Patricia K. Townsend]]'s work highlights the difference between ecological anthropology and [[environmental anthropology]]. In her view, some anthropologists use both terms in an interchangeable fashion.  She states that, "Ecological anthropology will refer to one particular type of research in environmental anthropology – field studies that describe a single ecosystem including a human population".&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;  Studies conducted under this sub-field "frequently deal with a small population of only a few hundred people such as a [[village]] or [[neighbourhood]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

==Globalization effects on the discipline==

Studies under the discipline are concerned with the [[ethnoecology|ethnoecologies]] of [[indigenous populations]].&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Due to various factors associated with [[globalization]], [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ethnoecologies are facing increasing challenges such as, "migration, media, and commerce spread people, institutions, information, and technology".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; "In the face of national and international incentives to exploit and degrade, ethnological systems that once preserved local and regional environments increasingly are ineffective or irrelevant".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Threats also exist of "commercial logging, industrial pollution, and the imposition of external management systems" on their local ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt;  These threats to indigenous ways of life are a familiar occurrence in the field of anthropology.  Conrad Phillip Kottak states that, "Today's ecological anthropology , aka environmental anthropology, attempts not only to understand but also to find solutions to environmental problems".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; The discipline's one of the approaches for finding such solutions is contemplating which aspects of human nature lead to environmental degradations. Such features of human nature can include a desire for technological innovations, aspiration for higher social status, and preoccupied or biased inclination to social justice.&lt;ref name="Kopnina2013"/&gt; Another approach to deal with contemporary climate issue is applying a norm of traditional ecological knowledge. Long-term ecological knowledge of an indigenous group can provide valuable insight into adaptation strategies, community-based monitoring, and dynamics between culturally important species and human.&lt;ref name="Vinyeta&amp;Lynn2013"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==

From the beginning various scholars criticised the discipline, saying it inherently was too focused on [[Static equilibrium|static equilibrii]] which ignored change, that it used [[circular reasoning]], and that it oversimplified systems.&lt;ref name=Vayda&amp;McCay1975/&gt;{{attribution needed|date=June 2013}} One of the current criticisms{{by whom|date=June 2013}} is that, in its original form, ecological anthropology relies upon [[cultural relativism]] as the [[norm (social)|norm]].&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; However, in today's world, there are few cultures that are isolated enough to live in a true [[Cultural relativity|culturally relative]] state. Instead, cultures are being influenced and changed by [[Mass media|media]], [[government]]s, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], businesses, etc.&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; In response, the discipline has seen a shift towards applied ecological anthropology, [[political ecology]] and [[environmental anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10180">The '''epideictic oratory''', also called '''ceremonial oratory''', or praise-and-blame [[rhetoric]], is one of the three branches, or "species" (eidē), of rhetoric as outlined in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', to be used to praise or blame during ceremonies.

== Origin and pronunciation ==
The term's root has to do with display or show (''deixis''). It is a literary or rhetorical term from the Greek (ἐπιδεικτικός). It is generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|aɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|eɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/epideictic] Another English form, now less common, is ''epidictic'' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.

== Characteristics ==
This is rhetoric of ceremony,  commemoration, declamation, demonstration, on the one hand,  and of play, entertainment,  display, including self-display.  It is also the rhetoric used at festivals, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]], [[state visit]]s and other formal events like  openings, closings,  anniversaries as well as at births, deaths, or marriages.  Its major subject  is praise and blame, according to  Aristotle in the limited space  he  provides  for it  in the ''Art of  Rhetoric'' (Freese translation).  

This rhetoric deals with  goodness, excellence, nobility, shame,  honor, dishonor,  beauty, and matters  of virtue and vice. The  virtues  or the "components" of  virtue  according to Aristotle,  were "justice, courage, self-control, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative wisdom"  or "reason". Vice  was the "contrary" of virtue. 

In his book ''Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity'', Jeffrey Walker claims that epideictic rhetoric predates the rhetoric of courts and politics, the study of which began in the 5th or 4th century BC with the [[Sophists]]. The other two kinds of public speech were deliberative or political speech, and forensic, judicial, or legal speech. Epideictic rhetoric  or style is according to Aristotle most appropriate for material that is written or read. In the ''Art of Rhetoric'', Aristotle stated  that  "The epideictic style is especially suited to written compositions; for its function  is reading." (423){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Aristotle on epideixis ==
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle instructs that in creating a speech of praise or blame, the author should consider the attitude of his audience: Will they be moved to see his object of praise (be it a person or a thing) in a new light, or will he be wasting everyone's time by "preaching to the choir"? What values and behavior does this particular audience find praiseworthy? Whether the audience is sympathetic, hostile, or indifferent to his object of praise or blame determines how difficult the task is that lies before him. As Aristotle reminds the reader, "[F]or as Socrates used to say, it is not difficult to praise Athenians in Athens" (''Rhetoric'',1367b).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''On Rhetoric'' Trans. by George A. Kennedy. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to [[Aristotle]]’s conception of epideixis, “the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often make use of other things, both reminding [the audience] of the past and projecting the course of the future” (''Rhet.'' 1358b). Epideixis is Aristotle’s least favored and clearly defined topic.  Now considered to be the stuff of ceremonies with its exhortations, [[panegyric]]s, [[encomia]], funeral orations and displays of oratorical prowess, epideictic rhetoric appears to most to be discourse less about depth and more attuned to style without substance. Still, the ''Art of Rhetoric'' is cited as an example of epideictic  work (Lockwood, 1996).

Epideixis may not deserve the charge of lacking depth. The charge that this branch of rhetoric lacks depth can be countered by the recognition that it systematizes the successful attribution of [[value (ethics)|value]] (to things, people, or concepts). Attributing value (whether in terms of "the good" and "the bad" or of "virtue" and "vice") to 1) perception, 2) emotions, 3) thought, 4) action, and 5) goals is the fundamental basis of relativistic conceptions of 1) [[aesthetics]], 2) human [[Sociology of emotions|character]], 3) [[intelligence]], 4) [[ethics]], and 5) [[wisdom]]. For instance, applying epideixis to 'human perceptions' yields [[aesthetics]], and its application to 'human action' yields fundamental relativistic [[ethics]]. Nevertheless, epideixis can always be reduced to simply the study of how best to preach the positive or negative characteristics of creatures, contraptions, concepts (etc.) to an audience. Epideictic rhetoric appeals to - and serves to sway - personal and cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], whereas pure deliberative and judicial rhetoric appeal to reason alone.

And, Lockwood,  also in ''Reader's Figure'',  describes how readers are figured by their readings, and how readers figure their readings, and that readers can accept the readers' account, and forget  their  own account  of their present and past,   and that the rhetor's account is  produced by language.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}

== Modern authors on epideixis ==
For centuries, epideictic [[Public speaking|oratory]] was a contested term, for it is clearly present in both forensic and deliberative forms, but it is difficult to clarify when it appears as a dominant discursive form. According to [[Chaïm Perelman]] and Lucy Olbrechts-Tyteca, “The speaker engaged in epidictic discourse is very close to being an [[educator]]. Since what he is going to say does not arouse [[controversy]], since no immediate practical interest is ever involved, and there is no question of attacking or defending, but simply of promoting values that are shared in the community . . .” (52).&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, ''The new rhetoric: a treatise on argumentation'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1969, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some of the defining terms for epideictic discourse include declamation, demonstration, praise or blame of the personal, and pleasing or inspiring to an audience.  

Lawrence W. Rosenfield contends that epideictic practice surpasses mere praise and blame, and it is more than a showy display of rhetorical skill: “Epideictic’s understanding calls upon us to join with our community in giving thought to what we witness, and such thoughtful beholding in commemoration constitutes memorializing” (133){{fcn|date=September 2018}}. Epideictic rhetoric also calls for witnessing events, acknowledging temporality and contingency (140).  However, as Rosenfield suspects, it is an uncommon form of [[discourse]] because of the rarity of “its necessary constituents — openness of mind, felt reverence for reality, enthusiasm for life, the ability to congeal significant experiences in memorable language . . .” (150).

The philologist [[Ernst Curtius]] provides an account of its history, and many examples, in ''[[European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages]]''. Praise and blame were "reduced" to praise by  Aristotle, he wrote; and recently another author called it a "blameless genre". He and Lockwood seem to say that what was in the past called rhetoric was later called literature. Curtius believed that misinterpretations  of [[medieval literature]] occur because so much of it is epideictic, and the epideictic is so alien to us today. During the Middle Ages it became a "school subject" as the sites for political activity diminished in the West, and as the centuries went on the word "praise" came to mean that which was written. During this period literature (more specifically histories, biographies, autobiographies, geographies) were called praise(s).

[[Ben Witherington III]], writing from a biblical perspective on sacred exhortation, noted that "in general, epideictic rhetoric is highly emotional and meant to inspire the audience to appreciate something or someone, or at the other end of the spectrum, despise something or someone.  Epideictic rhetoric seeks to charm or, to cast odium." - I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary &lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary - [http://libraryofrhetoric.org/lor/?page_id=90 More Quotes on Epideixis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Epideictic writing in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]] is often associated with the [[Fu (poetry)|''fu'' rhapsody]] that developed in the early [[Han Dynasty]].  This highly ornamented style was used for almost any subject imaginable, and often incorporated obscure language with extensive cataloguing of rare items, all in verse of varying rhyme and line length.&lt;ref&gt;[[David R. Knechtges]], Wen Xuan: ''or Selections of Refined Literature''. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commendatory verse''' is a genre of epideictic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Quentin Skinner]]|title=Reason and Rhetoric in the Philosophy of Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJO9y-sPdLAC&amp;pg=PA57|date=22 February 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55436-7|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance and Early Modern European tradition, it was taken to glorify both its author and the person to whom it was addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marina Frasca-Spada|author2=Nicholas Jardine|title=Books and the Sciences in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUmhAeUZtbsC&amp;pg=PA121|date=2 November 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65939-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prefatory verses of this kind—i.e. those printed as [[preface]] to a book—became a recognised type of advertising in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Bermingham|author2=John Brewer|title=The Consumption of Culture 1600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U7bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-80840-3|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Languages exploring the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==

===Constructed languages===
* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression. The people of Ascia were reduced to speaking only with their masters' voice; but they had made of it a new tongue, and I had no doubt, after hearing the Ascian, that by it he could express whatever thought he wished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Gene |year=1998 |title=The book of the new sun |publisher=SFBC |location=New York |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some worlds may be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] connected to [[Earth]] via magical portals or items (like [[Narnia]]); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like [[Middle-earth]]); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the [[Star Wars]] Galaxy).&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Imaginary lands", pp. 495–5 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Land", p. 558 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Fantasyland", p. 341 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72–3 {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy ''lands'', part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers.  For example, [[Land of Oz|Oz]], though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 739 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an [[ogre]] could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the [[Renaissance]] onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p. 68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900,&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"/&gt; was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set "long ago" or "far away". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p 52 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's [[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.

[[Dream world (plot device)|Dream frames]] were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.P. Lovecraft]] made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', Ballantine Books, New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p 210 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p. 211–2 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since [[William Morris]] used it in his early fantasy works, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 37, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly since the 1954 publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Such a world is often called "pseudo-medieval"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on [[Medievalism|romanticized views]] of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, "[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion]"&lt;/ref&gt; The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or [[oligarchies]], usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately [[pastoral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, {{ISBN|0-312-85175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p. 113, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'', clearly derived from China, or [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s use of real world cultures such as Welsh for ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' or Indian for ''[[The Iron Ring]]'', make the line between fantasy worlds and [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as [[Ruritania]] or [[Graustark]]—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such [[Ruritanian romance]]s may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 6 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lin Carter in ''[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]'', fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of [[magic (paranormal)]]. This element may be the creatures in it ([[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[genie]]s and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lin, ''Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy''. Ballantine, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructed worlds==
{{further|Constructed world}}
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|The Creation of the Two Trees figured in Tolkien's fantasy world, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]]]
Fantasy worlds created through a process called [[world building]] are known as a [[constructed world]]. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

===Examples===
*[[L. Frank Baum]] created the [[Land of Oz]] for his novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*[[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] created [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created [[Middle-earth]], possibly the most famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called "sub-creation". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's [[Old World]] in a fictional ancient era.
*[[George R. R. Martin]] created a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|fictional world]] for his novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the [[Game of Thrones title sequence|title sequence]] of the [[HBO]] TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
[[Fairytale fantasy]] may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully.  [[Comic fantasy]] may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other [[Fantasy subgenres|subgenres of fantasy]] suffer if the world-building is neglected.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== The retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce "a retreat of magic" (sometimes called "thinning") that explains why the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other fantastic elements no longer appear:&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Thinning", p. 942 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the destruction of the [[One Ring]] defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the [[elves]], resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A [[contemporary fantasy]] necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', the first major [[role-playing game]], has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called "[[campaign setting]]s"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The [[Forgotten Realms]] is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.

Many established fantasy writers have also derided ''Dungeons and Dragons'' and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[Monster Manual]]'' instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.

Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and [[science fiction]], it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between "fantasy worlds" and [[planets in science fiction]]. For example, the worlds of [[Barsoom]], [[Darkover]], [[Gor]], and the [[Witch World]] combine elements of both genres.

'''Feminism in the Netherlands''' began as part of the [[first-wave feminism]] movement during the 19th century. Later, the struggles of [[second-wave feminism]] in the [[Netherlands]] mirrored developments in the women's rights movement in other Western countries. Women in the Netherlands still have an open discussion about how to improve remaining imbalances and injustices they face as women.

==History==

===Renaissance and Enlightenment===
The Republic of the Seven United Provinces, known as the [[Netherlands]], was created through the Dutch War of Independence, which began in 1568 and ended with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]]. Women had a limited number of rights, including the right to enter contracts and the right to control their own [[dowry|dowries]]. Though they were still legally subordinate to men, widows such as [[Volcxken Diericx]], an Antwerp publisher, and [[Aletta Hannemans]], a Haarlem brewer, were allowed to continue their husband's business. Girls had no right to an education, and before widowhood, women were not allowed to own property or to participate in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early to Mid-19th century===
Industrialization in the Netherlands brought jobs to both men and women. Labour unions began organizing by the mid-19th century. In 1841, [[Barbera van Meerten-Schilperoort]] founded ''Hulpbetoon aan Eerlijke en Vlijtige Armoede,'' the first women's organization in the Netherlands. Middle class women began to find paid employment, first in nursing. The first department store in the Netherlands opened in 1860, and women began finding jobs as retail clerks. Kindergartens, which had been pioneered in Germany, spread quickly in the Netherlands and needed a workforce of trained young women to staff them. To train young women to teach primary school, middle schools for girls were established in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young women with academic promise could petition for the right to be admitted to an all-male secondary school. Universities were closed to women until 1871, when [[Aletta Jacobs]] gained admittance to study medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated as Europe's first modern woman physician. Jacobs also became prominent in the [[women's suffrage]] movement in the Netherlands. She opened the first women's birth control clinic in Amsterdam in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First-wave feminists===
In the 1883 Dutch parliamentary elections, Aletta Jacobs petitioned for the right to vote, pointing out that she met all the legal criteria, but she was rejected from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=176|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event triggered the women's suffrage movement in the Netherlands. The immediate result was an amendment to the voting rights of the Constitution in 1887, to specify "male" inhabitants of the Netherlands had the vote, adding another barrier to the women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=177|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the ''Vrije Vrouwenvereeniging'' (Free Women's Movement, or VVV) was founded. This was soon followed in 1894 by the creation of a sub-group within the organization, the ''Vereeniging vor Vrouwenkiesrecht'' (Organization of Women's Suffrage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=177|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Drucker]] was less concerned about women winning emancipation—which she saw as easily attainable—than women winning equal opportunity in the workplace, a struggle she saw as facing much more resistance from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protecting Women: Labor Legislation in Europe, the United States, and Australia ; 1880 - 1920|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252064647|page=45|editor=Ulla Wikander |editor2=Alice. Kessler-Harris |editor3=Jane E. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, where other feminists in the country pressed for labour laws addressing the specific needs of women workers, Drucker was opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protecting Women: Labor Legislation in Europe, the United States, and Australia ; 1880 - 1920|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252064647|page=200|editor=Ulla Wikander |editor2=Alice. Kessler-Harris |editor3=Jane E. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Drucker's view, "The state should not interfere with men or with women, nor invent a fictive competition between men and women. It should solely recognize people; members of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=179|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker was firmly on the radical edge of feminism in the Netherlands, but she gave speaking tours and published a popular feminist journal, ''Evolutie'' (Evolution). In 1899, she spearheaded a campaign to stop legislation that would ban women under 40 from jobs as teachers or civil servants; after a decade-long campaign, the bill was "crushed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aletta Jacobs co-founded the [[International Women's Suffrage Alliance]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1917 to 1960===
[[File:Tile Tribute to Dutch Women.jpg|thumb|A plaque tribute to Dutch wives who persevered during the [[Hunger Winter]] of 1944-5.]]
Women won the right to stand for an election as a candidate in 1917. They gained full suffrage in 1919. This was relatively early compared to most other European nations; only Finland and Sweden had given women the vote earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=176|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women had in part gained the vote to a political compromise "package deal" between socialists, liberals, and "confessionalist" parties. The confessionalists supported state funding for private schools, typically belonging to a religious denomination. This compromise system in Dutch politics was known as [[Pillarisation]]. In the years after women's emancipation, the confessionalists came to dominate moral discourse in the Netherlands, and legislation in support of confessionalist moral views was enacted (prostitution banned, 1912; abortion prohibited, 1911; advertising for contraception criminalized).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=184|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A healthy economy and a rising standard of living characterizes life in the Netherlands during the 1920s. Women, however, faced a backlash against women's rights which reached into the workplace. Women's rights groups multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international feminist organizations gained larger memberships as women worldwide continued to struggle for emancipation. Dutch women were active in such international organizations as:
* [[League of Nations]];
* [[International Labour Organization]];
* [[International Council of Women]];
* IWSA/IAW, the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, after 1926 called the [[International Alliance of Women]].

Women were praised for their resilience throughout the [[Hunger Winter]] of 1944-5 when food and fuel were blocked by the Nazi military. A period of conservatism followed for several years, but two notable legal milestones were achieved during the 1950s: in 1955, the law changed so that women could no longer be forced from civil service jobs after marrying, and in 1956, married women became legally competent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G.

===Second-wave feminism===

A 1967 essay by [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smits]], "The Discontent of Women", was published in ''De Gids'' and is credited with launching second-wave feminism in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joke-smit-feministe-en-journaliste|title=Joke Smit: feministe en journaliste|date=6 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203876800|page=17|editor1=Rosemarie Buikema |editor2=Iris van der Tuin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, a group of feminist men and women banded together to create the activist group ''Man-Vrouw-Maatschappij'' (Man-Woman society, or MVM). Its dual-gender composition made it rare among Western Second-wave feminist organizations, but it was similar to others in that its membership was predominantly middle or upper class and well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the lobbying efforts of the MVM, a more radical group was inspired. The all-female [[Dolle Mina]] society was founded in 1969, naming itself "Mad Mina" after pioneering Dutch feminist Wilhelmina Drucker. Dolle Mina had success as a consciousness-raising force during the 1970s, mainly through its use of imaginative protests, such as an outdoor "Discrimination Fair" to draw attention to the issue of equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Der Vleuten|first=Anna|title=The Price of Gender Equality (Epub) Member States and Governance in the European Union|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781409498063|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1976 publication of [[Anja Meulenbelt]]'s novel ''De Schaamte Voorbij'' (''The Shame is Over'') was another important piece of second-wave feminist writing in the Netherlands. The novel was confessional in tone, and made the connection between the body and language politics overt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Dutch: on Culture and Society of the Netherlands|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089641007|pages=195–6|editor1=Emmeline N. Besamusca |editor2=J. Verheul }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, the fight for access to abortion, rape crisis centres, and women's shelters became a dominant focus of the feminist movement. In 1980, the government was financially supporting 30 rape crisis centres in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, feminist periodicals multiplied, such as ''Dolle Mina'', ''Vrouwen'', ''Opzij'', ''Serpentine'', ''Vrouwenkrant'', and ''Lover'', and there were several feminist publishing houses in Amsterdam, the best known being De Bonte Was (1972) and Sara (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|pages=154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, an estimated 160 feminist groups were active in the Netherlands, covering 25% of Dutch towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Simon|title=Women and Political Power: Europe since 1945|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203134269|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s saw many victories for the feminist movement, including the disintegration of the male breadwinner logic as the Netherlands began to prioritize re-gearing the welfare state in favor of incorporating women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evertsson|first1=M.|last2=England|first2=P.|last3=Mooi-Reci|first3=I.|last4=Hermsen|first4=J.|last5=de Bruijn|first5=J.|last6=Cotter|first6=D.|title=Is Gender Inequality Greater at Lower or Higher Educational Levels?

==Third-wave feminism==
Despite having won many legal and social battles over the course of the 20th century, Dutch feminists are not ready to claim victory. Feminist activity continues in the Netherlands, and gender equality continues to be a topic of discussion in organizations, and in the media. Areas of concern remain the low participation of women in full-time employment and their low presence in top executive positions,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/womens-labour-force-participation&lt;/ref&gt; violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/safety-of-girls-and-women&lt;/ref&gt; and discrimination against ethnic minority women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, the Netherlands has started promoting policies based on gender equality;
and has once been described as having "the most extensive and comprehensive [sex equality apparatus] in Europe"; this is largely due to the appointment of a State Secretary to oversee an Emancipation Council launched in 1977, and its implementation of policies at the local level with help from feminist activists recruited into government positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Simon|title=Women and Political Power: Europe since 1945|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203134269|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of colour have seen the need to create new organizations to advance gaps in meeting their needs: a Moroccan women's group was formed in 1992, and a Surinamese women's group was formed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the [[European Communities]] report ''Women in the European Community'' fount that "it is  in  the  Netherlands (17.6%)  and  in  Ireland  (13.6%)  that  we  see  the  smallest  numbers  of  married  women  working  and  the  least  acceptance  of  this  phenomenon  by  the  general  public". (pg 14).&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following years the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but with most of the women [[part time job|working part time]].

{{blockquote| Nearly 60% of Dutch working women aged 25-54 worked part-time in 2001, compared to 15% in the United States, 25% in France and 35% in Germany; but where 25% of French women working part-time say they want to work full-time, just 4% of Dutch women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.S.|title=Why Dutch women don't work longer hours|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/dutch_feminism|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Despite the government identifying this as a social problem in the 1990s, and introducing tax incentives to encourage women to find more paid employment, the opposite happened, and women found a way to use the tax incentives to reduce their working hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.S.|title=Why Dutch women don't work longer hours|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/dutch_feminism|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of balancing work and home life, parental leave is much more generous in Sweden, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a great deal of debate in the Netherlands over whether women simply prefer to care for their children themselves and work reduced hours, or if higher costs are holding women back from seeking further employment. Economist, lawyer and journalist Helen Mees wrote a book exploring the issue of women's low employment rate, called ''Weg met het deeltijdfeminisme'' (''Away with Part-time Feminism'') in 2005. She identified differences between Dutch and American culture that partially explain the discrepancy in working hours between women in the two nations. In her book, Mees discusses the American "marketization" of much of women's former household duties, such as using businesses for laundry, eating out, having groceries delivered, and other services, which are rarely available in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childcare is the largest expense for two-income families in the Netherlands, and since it is customarily paid by the hour, this may provide an incentive for families to reduce childcare costs by having the mother do more child-minding and less paid employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', fewer men had to fight in the World Wars of the 20th century, and so Dutch women did not experience working for pay at rates women in other countries did. The wealth of the country, coupled with the fact that "[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s" meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Netherlands, together with Germany and Austria, were identified by the European Commission as countries with a poor integration of women in the workforce; [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the Netherlands had the highest percentage of part-time women workers in the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071301/http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been criticism that the Netherlands has constructed a policy focused on emphasizing the alleged difference between 'liberated' ethnic Dutch women and 'oppressed' immigrant women, creating a discriminatory dichotomy of "us ''vs''. them".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/ispp/doc_upload/Roggeband_migrant_women.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CEDAW]] committee stated that "[t]he Committee remains concerned about the persistence of gender-role stereotypes, in particular about immigrant and migrant 
women and men, both of which are portrayed as being backward and having traditional views about women, denying their right to full development."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Violence against women]] remains a problem in the Netherlands: according to a 2014 study published by the [[European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]], the Netherlands had the fourth highest prevalence rate of physical and sexual violence against women in Europe, with 45% of women having experienced such violence, which is well above the European average of 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307224554/http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Netherlands was condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1985 in the case of ''X and Y v. the Netherlands'', for inadequate prosecution of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57603#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-57603%22]}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Netherlands ratified the [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] (Istanbul Convention).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210/signatures&lt;/ref&gt;

An important (and controversial) contemporary activist  is [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] a [[Somali people|Somali]]-born Dutch-American dual citizen activist, author, and politician. She is critical of [[female genital mutilation]] and [[Criticism of Islam|Islam]], and supportive of [[women's rights]] and [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2015/03/22/activist-argues-for-a-complete-reformation-of-islam/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The '''four field approach''' in [[anthropology]] sees the discipline as composed of the four subfields of [[Archaeology]], [[Linguistics]], [[Physical Anthropology]] and [[Cultural anthropology]]. The approach is conventionally understood as having been developed by [[Franz Boas]] who developed the discipline of anthropology in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E. N. (2003), Four-Field Anthropology. Anthropology News, 44: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Beck Kehoe. 1998. Humans:  An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology. Psychology Press, 1998 - Social Science&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 re-assessment of the evidence has indicated that the idea of four-field anthropology has a more complex 19th-century history in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Dan|title=Four Field Anthropology: Charter Myths and Time Warps from St. Louis to Oxford|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2013|volume=54|issue=6|pages=753|jstor=10.1086/673385|doi=10.1086/673385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Boas, the four field approach was motivated by his [[Holism|holistic]] approach to the study of human behavior, which included integrated analytical attention to culture history, material culture, [[anatomy]] and population history, customs and social organization, [[folklore]], grammar and language use. For most of the 20th century, U.S. Anthropology departments housed anthropologists specializing in all of the four branches, but with the increasing professionalization and specialization, elements such as [[linguistics]] and [[archaeology]] came to be regarded largely as separate disciplines. Today, physical anthropologists often collaborate more closely with biology and medicine than with cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Borofsky, R. (2002), The Four Subfields: Anthropologists as Mythmakers. American Anthropologist, 104: 463–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8483">[[File:Gorgoneion Regnaudin Amelot de Bisseuil.jpg|thumb|A wooden door panel intended to guard the house from an unwelcome guest ([[Thomas Regnaudin]], former Hôtel des Ambassadeurs de Hollande, rue vieille du Temple, Paris c. 1660).]]

In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γοργόνειον) was a special [[apotropaic]]  [[amulet]] showing the [[Gorgon]] head, used most famously by the [[Olympian gods|Olympian deities]] [[Athena]] and [[Zeus]]: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="Vassilika"&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal [[aegis]] to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], as shown, for instance, on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]].

==Origin==
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult associated with "dynamic life energy" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: "The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster".&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Homer]] refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more... a [[mask]] with a body later appended".&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare, "seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (''But see'' the common depiction of the [[Evil_eye#Greece|evil eye]] on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, [[eye-cup]]s, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an [[Dionysian Mysteries|orgiastic deity]] akin to [[Dionysus]].

Gorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:OlympiaGorgo retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Winged Gorgoneion (Olympia B 110)|Winged Gorgoneion]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], originally an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] shield decoration, early sixth century BC]]
[[File:Gorgoneion Cdm Paris 320.jpg|thumb|Gorgoneion on the Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figured]] cup, end of sixth century BC - Cabinet des médailles de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, France.]]
Gorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an [[electrum]] [[stater]] discovered during excavations at [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; Other early eighth-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her book, ''Language of the Goddess'', she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in [[Neolithic]] art motifs, especially in [[anthropomorphic]] vases and [[terracotta]] masks inlaid with gold.

In the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical "lion mask type" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest occurrence being in the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Marconi"&gt;{{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on [[antefix]]es of smaller structures throughout the next century.&lt;ref name="Marconi"/&gt;

Apart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in [[numismatics|numismatic ubiquity]] only to several principal [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On [[Attica|Attic]] kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=189, figs. 27–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1991|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kievan Rus]], and was revived in the West by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists.

More recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by [[Gianni Versace]] as a logo for his fashion company.

'''HLA-NET''' is a network targeted to the study of [[Human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) from a [[population genetics|populational]] point of view. The network was initiated by [[COST]] Action BM0803&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/bmbs/Actions/BM0803 Action page] on COST official site&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2009. Currently [http://hla-net.eu HLA-NET] activities are being coordinated by a subcommittee of the scientific committee of the  [[European Federation for Immunogenetics]].

==The project==

The guidelines also include rules for the validation of samples and suggests minimal requirements for data analysis. The [http://hla-net.eu HLA-NET portal] provides an interface to software implementing these guidelines.

===Particularities of HLA data===

==HLA-NET guidelines==

===Population description===
HLA-NET main recommendations for population characterization have been published.&lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; Most notably, outdated racial/ethnical and meaningless terms have to be replaced by an acceptable terminology to describe populations (i.e. geographical and cultural criteria). 
An electronic population questionnaire for field studies is available on the [http://hla-net.eu/wiki_spa/doku.php?id=wg1:population_questionnaire HLA-NET portal].

===Obtaining and reporting data===
HLA-NET defined standards for producing high quality data for HLA genotyping and proposed [http://hla-net.eu/wiki_spa/doku.php?id=wg2:guidelines guidelines for reporting typing ambiguities]. A best suitable format for optimal allelic and haplotypic HLA frequency estimations, based on the list of allele pairs that account for the genotyping information, has been published.&lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; Other formats that allow to express ambiguities without simplifying the data can also be used.

===Validation of data sets===
[[Sample (statistics)|Sample]]s are used to provide [[allele frequency]] estimates for populations. For HLA [[Locus (genetics)|''loci'']], the presence of ambiguities and that of putative recessive-like undetected alleles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunes|first=JM|author2=Riccio, ME |author3=Tiercy, JM |author4= Sanchez-Mazas, A |title=Allele frequency estimation from ambiguous data: using resampling schema in validating frequency estimates and in selective neutrality testing.|journal=Human Biology|date=Jun 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=437–47|pmid=21740157|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:16925|doi=10.3378/027.083.0307}}&lt;/ref&gt; require the assumption of [[Hardy-Weinberg]]. HLA-NET explicitly requests that frequency estimates, for alleles or haplotypes, be validated by checking their conformity with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. If Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is rejected then the frequencies can not be taken as representative of the population. The causes for deviation should be looked for &lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; and, if possible, addressed. In any case, non Hardy-Weinberg frequencies should never be used as valid population estimates.

===Data analysis===

===Usability of registry data===
Registries have moderate to huge data sets, but the recruitment often is not performed in such a way that registry data can be considered as representative of the population. However, under certain conditions, it is possible to assess if a given registry might be used as a population sample or not. Undergoing work is being conducted to formalise the constraints and the procedures required to use registry data as a proxy to population samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropological aspects of BMD Registries|url=http://www.efiweb.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_nl/issue_70.pdf#13|work=EFI Newsletter - Issue 70|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Constantia Voniatis Papaioannou!|author2=Alicia Sanchez-Mazas|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage interpretation''' refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in [[museology]] prefer the term '''mediation''' for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.

Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated [[interpretation centres]] or at [[museum]]s, historic sites, [[parks]], art galleries, nature centres, [[zoos]], [[Public aquarium|aquaria]], [[botanical gardens]], nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include [[guided walks]], [[Speech|talks]], [[drama]], staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called [[interpretive planning]]. The [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach]] to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the [[National Association for Interpretation]], the US [[National Park Service]], and others, is considered best practice.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive planning|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu &amp; Merriman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Personal Interpretation: Connecting Your Audience to Heritage Resources|year=2002|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-06-0|author2=Merriman, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo et al.

Those who practice this form of interpretation may include [[park ranger|rangers]], [[guide]]s, [[Natural history|naturalists]], [[actors]] (who may wear period dress and do reenactments), museum curators, natural and cultural interpretive specialists, interpretation officers, heritage communicators, [[Museum docent|docents]], [[educators]], visitor services staff, interpreters or a host of other titles. The interpretive process is often assisted by new technologies such as visualizing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Sideris A., 2008.

== "Tilden's principles" of interpretation ==

In his 1957 book, "Interpreting Our Heritage", [[Freeman Tilden]] defined six principles of interpretation:
{{quote|
# Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
# Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information.
# Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
# The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
# Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
# Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.}}

For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published "Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in "The Gift of Interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, L, Cable,T.

The area was also divided into two parts: Poshtkuh and Pishkuh, in the Qajar dynasty. Today, Lorestan is the name of one of the western provinces of Iran.

== Origin ==
There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Medean or Persian tribe of Aryan origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nowadays they speak an Iranian language and consider themselves as pure Iranians.
=== Name ===
The word Lur for the first time is seen in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] in [[Tarikh-i guzida|Tarikh-e gozida]] (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Lurish tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Lurish-inhabited areas. Several hyphothesis are discussed about the origin of the name Lur or Lor. It is attributed to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally Forst or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.&lt;ref&gt;H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early History ==
Luristan is mainly a mountainous juicy and lush area with prosperous  pasturages.  There are several dominant tree species like oak, elm, walnut and almond around Luristan.[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Cave painting]] in Doushe cave, Lorestan, Iran, 8th millennium BC]]
[[File:Disc-headed pin zoom (2) Bronze Beaker Luristan 1000 BC (Rietberg museum).JPG|thumb|right|200px|Zoom of a disc-headed pin (pin, female figure). Found in Lorestan, [[Rietberg Museum]], [[Zürich]]]]
The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the [[Ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Kassites]], an ancient people who spoke neither an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], originated in Lorestān. They would control [[Babylonia]] after the fall of the [[Old Babylonian Empire]] ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.
Luristan was invaded and settled by the Iranian [[Medes]] in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the [[Kassites]] as well as the [[Gutians]], by the time the area was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC.
In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the [[Achaemenid]] era were made in Lorestan for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82418319/ | title=Archeologist: First signs of Achaemenids discovered in Western Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Aryan settlement in Luristan, precedes more than 1000 years BC. From the Indo-European ethnic groups, first, the Medes settled in areas known as Lorestan. Between 625 and 700 BC, other tribes like the Scythians settled in Lorestan.
=== Elam ===
The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. However, They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.&lt;ref name=loor1&gt;{{یادکرد وب| نشانی = http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&amp;ln=fa| عنوان = آیا لر آریاییست یا عیلامی و کاسی؟| تاریخ بازدید =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴| نویسنده =| تاریخ =۲۶ شهریور ۱۳۸۹| ناشر =نشریه اینترنتی مردم لر| زبان =فارسی| نشانی بایگانی = https://archive.today/Waga| تاریخ بایگانی =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam provice and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Lurish settelment. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning "the mountain" and perhaps "the land of sunrise".
Elamite is generally accepted to be a [[language isolate]] and thus unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-[[Lurs]], whose language became [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] only in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite#v=onepage&amp;q=proto-lurs%20elamite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grugni&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grugni | first1 = V | last2 = Battaglia | first2 = V | last3 = Hooshiar Kashani | first3 = B | last4 = Parolo | first4 = S | last5 = Al-Zahery | first5 = N ''et al.

==== Elamite cities ====
The major cities of the Elamites were Shush, Ahvaz, Madakto and Kheidalou. [[Walther Hinz]] believes that the current KhorramAbad in the era of the Elamites was the capital of a dynasty called Simashki.
In the course of several thousand years, the Elamites maintained their identity against strong tribes such as [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Assyrians]].
Eventually, they were defeated by their enemy of Assyria in 654 BC because of internal disputes and wars.
The rise of the Elamites and the formation of the Elamite government in the north of Khuzestan plain is the most important political event of Iran in the third millennium BC. Since then, before the arrival of the Medes and Persians, what we know from the history of the land of Iran is only the political history of Elamite.

=== Kassites ===
Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled  the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.
They were brave and warrior riders and repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They even managed to overthrow the government of Babylon and ruled theBabylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |عنوان =قوم کاسی | ناشر =مهدی رازانی |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۳ آذر ۱۳۹۱}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =گرانتوسگی |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۴۵}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =پیگولووسکایا |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از عهد باستان تا قرن ۱۸| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۵۳}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achaemenids to Sassanids ===
During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=4454 |عنوان =جبال (۱) (جمع جَبَل) یا کورة جَبَل یا قُهِستان یا قوهستان (معرّب کوهستان) یا بلاد جبال | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to the this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty anf finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named "Pahla".&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2899 |عنوان =پَهلَوی | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Islamic era ==
In spite of several resistance efforts, the Arab conquest of Iran, led to the end of the Sasanid Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Iran (including Lurish territory) was under the absolute sovereignty of Arabs for two centuries. Lur people, however, managed to maintain the language and many of their customs. Until the end of the third century AH, the district of Lorestan paid the taxes to Kufa and was directly governed by the Caliphs. Different free-seeking revolts led to gradual reestablishment of Iranian local dynasties in the beginning of the ninth century.
After the Arab dominance, Luristan was under control of [[Hasanwayhids]], [[Buyids]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqids]], respectively.

By the middle of the tenth century, the total Lurish-inhabited areas were known as Luristan. Along with the gradual weakening of Seljuks, several autonomous atabeg were formed across Iran. Luristan Atabegs or Hazaraspids established an autonomous state in the Lurish-inhabited areas. After that, the territory was divided into two parts: Lur-e-kuchek (Minor Luristan) and Lur-e-bozorg (Major Luristan). The former corresponded to modern Luristan and Ilam provinces and some areas in the current western Iraq while the latter included modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluye-Boir Ahmed, Mamasani and some coastal areas in Bushehr. In spite of all these invasions, the Lurs maintained their territorial integrity, absorbed the invaders, and eventually established two local dynasties known as Atabak or Atabeg during the twelfth century.
Hazaraspids (Atabaks of Luristan) is the name of Lur dynasty that ruled a large area of Iran for a long while (1148–1424). Their territory included almost all the current Lurish-inhabited regions. Luristan Atabeg then divided in two Atabegs; the Minor Luristan (Lore kučak) and the Major Luristan (Lore bozorg) with Khorram Abad and Idaj as their capitals, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids |عنوان =هزاراسپیان | ناشر =دانشنامه ایرانیکا |تاریخ  = |تاریخ بازدید =‎۶ آبان ۱۳۸۹|زبان=انگلیسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lor-e-Bozorg (Major Luristan) ===
A big  part of the Lurish areas came under the control of a local dynasty known as Lur-e bozorg Atabegs during the twelfth century. It was established in 1155 AD. The area under the control of major Luristan rulers (modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmed, Mamasani and parts of Khuzistan, Bushehr and Isfahan provinces) was included a vast territory extending from the Dez River in the north Khuzistan to the central areas of [[Fars province|Fars]] in the southern Iran. In spite of evidences indicating the economic and social proserity, the Atabak dynasty finally extinct by [[Ibrahim Sultan ibn Shahrukh]] invasion in 1423. As a result, the territorial unity and the economic prosperity of the Major Luristan was terminated. The territory was divided into tribal sectins without a centralized coherence. During the Safavid period (1501–1750), Major Luristan was divided into three parts: the northern part became known as [[Bkhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], the central part as [[Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad|Kuhgilu]], and the southern part as [[Mamasani County|Mamasani]].

=== Lor-e-Kuchek (Minor Luristan) ===
Traditionally the Minor Luristan corresponded to current provinces of Luristan and Ilam and some Feyli-inhabited areas in Iraq (belt of mountainous region stretching from the plains of the Tigris in the west to the Diz River in the east).Shojaeddin Khorshid establshed the dynasty as the Atabakan-i-Luristan, which lasted from 1184 to 1597. The rulers established their capital in Khorramabad (currently the provincial capital of [[Luristan province]].

==== Lurish Walies dynasty ====
The Atabak dynasty was replaced by the Wali dynasty (1596–1929). The founder of the new dynasty was Husain Khan, whose father had married the aunt of the last Atabak, and on the basis of this kinship tie Husain Khan later received the position of ruler of Lur-j-kuchek. The Walis played a significant role in the political affairs of Iran. They guarded southwestern Iran against the Ottomans, who constantly attacked the western and southwestern borders of the country. Ali Mardan Khan was appointed the commander-in-chief of the entire Iranian armed forces dur downfall of the Safavids, when the country was invaded by the Afghans in the early eighteenth century (De Bode 1845).

The reign of the Walis coincided with several dynasties of Iran including: Safavid (1501–1736), Afshar (1736–1750), Zand (1750–1794), Qajar (1796–1925) and the beginning of the Pahlavi(1924–1929). The last two dynasties, namely the Qajar and Pahlavi, are responsible for the political weakness of the Lurs and the decline of the Wali dynasty. Thus, the Lurs maintained their political integrity under the Safavids and Afshars, while they ruled over Iran during the Zand dynasty. However, when the Qajars came to power, they divided Lur-i-kuchek into two parts, Luristan and Posht-kuh. From this time on, the domain of the Walis was limited to Posht-kuh only, while Luristan came under the direct control of the central government. Thus, a governor-general, usually a member of the royal family, was appointed by the king and sent to Luristan. Yet during the Qajar dynasty, Luristan was continually in a state of anarchy. The Qajars were unable to subdue the tribes of Luristan and hence, except for some short periods, there was no peace in Luristan. As a matter of fact, the Qajar dynasty lost total control over Luristan after the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896. In short, the division of Lur-i-kuchek by the Qajar dynasty weakened the political strength of the Walis and reduced the Lurs' political influence. Furthermore, the inability of the Qajars to establish law and order in Luristan contributed to the expansion of pastoral nomadism and the destruction of settled communities. Consequently, Luristan suffered politically as well as economically under Qajar rule.

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Khan, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1925. The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) is best characterized as a dictatorial monarchy with absolute rule, that is, the concentration of power in the monarch's hands. The regime built an army whose strength was without precedent in the history of Iran. The army was used against Lurs and other groups who refused to give up their power to the new regime. Through bloody confrontations between the new monarch and the Lurs (as well as other peoples in Iran), the Pahlavi dynasty eventually crushed the powers of the Lurs. Thus, Reza Shah ended the Wali dynasty of Posht-kuh, executed or exiled many of the Lur leaders, forcefully sedentarized the nomadic pastoral tribes and changed the territorial integrity of Lur-i-kuchek.

== Modern history ==
=== The Lurs under the Pahlavi Regime ===

While the Qajar dynasty was responsible for the spread of anarchy among the Lurs, the Pahlavi-dynasty was responsible for their political disorganization, social disruption and the loss of political freedom and semi-independent status. For the first time in their long history, the Lurs were stripped of their traditional rights and political freedom by the Pahlavi dynasty. When Reza Shah took power, he established a centralized government, transferring power from the provincial communities to Tehran. He carried out his plan through the use of military operations against various provincial communities, including the Lurs. A key element to Reza Shah's success was that the Lurs were not unified so he could attack each group separately. Furthermore, Reza Shah used one tribe to fight against another. As the Lurs were defeated, Reza Shah took the following measures to keep them under control: 1) tribal leaders were removed from their positions of authority and were replaced by military officials, 2) many of the leaders, were executed, imprisoned or exiled to other parts of Iran, 3) some tribes were exiled to distant lands, 4) all pastoral nomadic tribes, which formed the majority of the Lur population, were forceably sedentarized without sufficient provisions, 5) all tribesmen were disarmed, 6) the use of the traditional black tent was outlawed, 7) tribesmen were ordered to abandon their traditional costume and were forced to wear Western clothes; however, this rule was not totally carried out, and 8) governmental offices were established in order to carry out the state policies.

The above policies were intended to subjugate the Lurs to the central government. Reza Shah altered the traditional sociopolitical organization of the Lurs without providing opportunities for their participation in local or national government. Undoubtedly the establishment of the central state demanded the integration of various regions and ethnic groups. However, that need not entail political deprivation and the lack of respect for members of the different tribal or ethnic groups. Under the Pahlavi regime, however, the establishment of the modern state came to mean precisely that – the expansion of state domination and disruption of the traditional political organization without the slightest opportunity for peoples to participate in local or national politics.

Reza Shah was deposed by the British and Russians in 1941, and was replaced by his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who ruled from 1941 to 1979. The reign of Mohammed Reza Shah witnessed further centralization of state power and the disintegration of traditional political organization among the Lurs. The enforcement of the land reform program and the nationalization of the forests and pastureland (1962–63 along with various forces of modernization including the expansion of capitalism, urbanism and modern schooling gradually changed many aspects of the Lurs' culture.

Under the Pahlavi regime, the Lurs lost their freedom and their semi-independent status, and the Lurs' territories were divided into several administrative units without any regard for traditional boundaries. For instance, Lur-i-kuchek has been limited to modern Luristan while Posht-kuh, formerly ruled by the Wali dynasty, was incorporated into Ilam province. The most dramatic change caused by the Pahlavi regime was the loss of freedom and the semi-independent status of the Lurs. Prior to the establishment of the Pahlavi Regime, basic decisions were made within the local communities. For instance, the Bakhtiari was ruled by a local dynasty who paid certain tributes to the central government, while internal affairs were taken care of by the members of that dynasty. In Luristan, each tribal group acted as a semi-independent unit. In Posht-kuh, the Walis were supreme, while the tribes of Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed and those of Mamasani also enjoyed the same internal freedom. The Pahlavi regime, however, sent high-ranking officials from Tehran to supervise the Lur territories. Just prior to the recent revolution, all governors-general were directly appointed by the Shah without taking into consideration the existence of the Lurs' communities. Lurs, like other Iranians, were prohibited from organizing political parties, forming associations or expressing themselves through mass media and public gatherings.

Second, Iranian oil is extracted from the mountain slopes of Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed provinces, but the Lurs were deprived from their share of oil revenue, particularly during the reign of Mohammed Reza Shah. The money derived from oil went to the pockets of the Tehranis, creating regional economic inequalities.

Third, despite the fact that the Pahlavi regime provided elementary and, to some extent, secondary education for the Lurs, it failed to provide them with opportunities for higher education. Until a few years prior to the revolution, not a single institution of higher education was established among the Lurs, nor were they given scholarships or financial support. The Pahlavi regime was thus responsible for depriving the Lurs of access to higher and prestigious positions. High-ranking Lur families were the only exceptions; they could afford to send their children to universities either in Iran or outside the country.

Modern education was used during the Pahlavi rule as a way to undermine local cultural values. School curriculum was prepared in Tehran without taking the cultural diversity among the Iranian peoples into consideration. Not a single course in the entire elementary, high school or university curricula reflected the history, geography or sociocultural values of the Lurs.

In sum, the Lurs lost their sociopolitical integrity under the Pahlavi dynasty. They were integrated into the "modern" state without any opportunity for effective participation in the decision-making process that affected their lives.

=== The Lurs under the Islamic Regime ===

It is too early to evaluate the sociopolitical conditions of the Lurs under the present regime. So far, political parties, associations and local newspapers have not yet emerged. Administrative boundaries of the Lurs' territories remain unchanged from those of the Pahlavi regime. While it is difficult to speculate about the future of the Lurs under the current regime, considering the fact that the present regime is concerned more with an Islamic community rather than with a country of diverse ethnic groups, it seems unlikely that there will be considerable change in the near future.

'''''Humanist''''' is an international electronic [[seminar]] on humanities computing and the [[digital humanities]], in the form of a long-running [[electronic mailing list]] and its associated archive. The primary aim of ''Humanist'' is to provide a forum for discussion of intellectual, scholarly, pedagogical, and social issues and for exchange of information among members.

''Humanist'' is also a [[publication]] of the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) and the [[Office for Humanities Communication]] (OHC) and an affiliated publication of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS). In  2008, there were 1650 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Report on ''Humanist'' 2007‐8 |author= Willard McCarty |date= June 15, 2008 |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/McCarty__Report_on_Humanist_2008-abbreviated.pdf |accessdate= October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ''Humanist'' list was created in 1987 by [[Willard McCarty]], then at the [[University of Toronto]], as a [[BITNET]] (NetNorth in Canada) [[electronic mail]] newsletter for people who support computing in the humanities for the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].  McCarty, later at [[King's College London]], continued to edit it.

Although ''Humanist'' started off as a means of communication for people directly involved in the support of humanities computing, it grew in scope to become an extended conversation about the nature of "humanities computing" (or "digital humanities", or one of a contested range of other names), about what computing looks like viewed from the humanities, and humanities from computing: "''Humanist'' remains the forum within which the technology, informed by the concerns of humane learning, can be viewed from an interdisciplinary common ground." &lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/announcement.html What is ''Humanist''?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judicial activism''' refers to [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name="cwolfe"&gt;{{cite book|first = Christopher |last = Wolfe|title = Judicial activism|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn = 0-8476-8531-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtQu8dnH9coC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=0-8476-8531-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KePXbURFud&amp;sig=rMU-TMUfzmUXC6L3MWGKOkIqECk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3Z_2vZXcAhUPbKwKHXjZD_QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8476-8531-4&amp;f=false|date = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Etymology==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism," is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; "Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism"] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the "despotic behaviour" of [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] federal judges, in particular Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254 Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a "philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No" DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – "Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism," ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2015}}

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that "in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with";&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-12691-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12691-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that "most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] has said that, "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."&lt;ref name="flewis"&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, {{ISBN|0-8476-8992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled]," Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.

A third view is that so-called "objective" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, "Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, any judge's use of [[judicial discretion]] will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Zoldan, "Targeted Judicial Activism," 16 Green Bag 2d 465-66 (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2310915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
The '''killer ape theory''' or '''killer ape hypothesis''' is the theory that [[war]] and interpersonal [[aggression]] was the driving force behind [[human evolution]]. It was originated by [[Raymond Dart]] in the 1950s; later it was developed further in ''[[African Genesis]]'' by [[Robert Ardrey]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Ardrey"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Ardrey| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Ardrey
| title = African Genesis: A Personal Investigation Into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man
| year = 1961 | publisher = [[Atheneum Books]]| location = New York
| isbn = 978-0-00-211014-3 | oclc = 556678068 | lccn = 61015889
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yg1AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other [[primate]] species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many [[murder]]ous instincts.

The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do [[violence]] was a fundamental part of human [[psychology]]. The [[hunting hypothesis]] is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.

==Definition==
The expression ''killer ape'' does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.

As founder of this thesis, [[Raymond Dart|Raymond A. Dart]] (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article ''The predatory transition from ape to man'', 1953.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;{{cite journal

==The predatory transition from ape to human==

===The step from ape to human===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] refers to the Australian anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.

The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Smith]] excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.

Until [[Raymond Dart]] found the [[Australopithecus africanus]] (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.

===The "Taung Child"===
This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “[[Taung Child]]”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. [[Robert Broom]] (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the [[Australopithecus africanus]].

However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.

Both [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Broom|Broom]], as well as [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.

===The findings of Makapan===
Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.

These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.

This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.

===The "proto-men"===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] to bring them more in line with humans.

Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in ''The predatory transition from ape to man'' by [[Raymond Dart]].&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.

===The eating habits===
Concerning the eating habits from then until now, [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive [[cannibalism]]) are the results.

A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.

==Reception==
The comment written by the editor of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]]. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of ''nobody else''.”

Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] thesis by a scientific convention at [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] ([[Zambia]], Southern Africa), which led [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]] into writing his book ''African Genesis''. He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.

The ethologist [[Konrad Lorenz]] also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite book

The [[Seville Statement on Violence]], released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular [[warfare]] as genetically determined.

A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]] which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book ''War, Peace, and Human Nature'' (2013), edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]].&lt;ref name=Haas&amp;Piscitelli&gt;See for example Jonathan Haas and [[Matthew Piscitelli]] (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/2968441/The_Prehistory_of_Warfare_Misled_by_Ethnography?login=&amp;email_was_taken=true "The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"] In War, Peace, and Human Nature edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]], pp. 168-190. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in fiction==
Movies such as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on [[Pierre Boulle]]’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.

This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and also appears in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs.  (The names of ''Dart'' and ''[[Ardrey]]'' were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into "''Drayer''" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".)

[[File:Koteka.jpg|thumb|Koteka souvenir]]
 
The '''koteka''', '''horim''',  or '''penis gourd''' is a [[penis]] sheath traditionally worn by native male inhabitants of some (mainly highland) ethnic groups in [[New Guinea]] to cover their genitals. They are normally made from a dried-out [[gourd]], ''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'', although other species, such as ''[[Nepenthes mirabilis]]'', are also used. They are held in place by a small loop of fiber attached to the base of the koteka and placed around the scrotum. There is a secondary loop placed around the chest or abdomen and attached to the main body of the koteka. Men choose kotekas similar to ones worn by other men in their cultural group. For example, [[Yali people|Yali]] men favour a long, thin koteka, which helps hold up the multiple rattan hoops worn around their waist. Men from [[Tiom]] wear a double gourd, held up with a strip of cloth, and use the space between the two gourds for carrying small items such as money and tobacco.

== Traditions ==
It is traditional [[clothing]] in certain [[New Guinea]] highlands societies including in the Grand [[Baliem Valley]] of [[Western New Guinea]] and the [[Ok Tedi]] and [[Telefomin]] regions of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is worn without other clothing, tied in upward position.

== Different identification ==
[[File:Koteka 2.jpg|thumb|Koteka]]
Many tribes can be identified by the way they wear their koteka. Some wear them pointed straight out, straight up, at an angle, or in other directions. The diameter of the koteka can also be a clue. Contrary to popular belief, there is little correlation between the size or length of the koteka and the social status of the wearer. Kotekas of different sizes serve different purposes: very short kotekas are worn when working and longer and more elaborate kotekas are worn on festive occasions. The koteka is made of a specially grown gourd. Stone weights are tied to the bottom of the gourd to stretch it out as it grows. Curves can be made in it by the use of string to restrain its growth in whatever direction the grower wishes. They can be quite elaborately shaped in this manner. When harvested, the gourd is emptied and dried. It is sometimes waxed with beeswax or native resins. It can be painted, or have shells, feathers and other decorations attached to it.

[[Sociolinguistic]]ally and [[political]]ly today, the term '''koteka''' is used as a name of tribal groups across the highlands of New Guinea, in both [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. For example, in West Papua today, there is an [[Koteka Tribal Assembly|Assembly of Koteka Tribes]]. The term ''koteka'' was never used to identify a society or ethnic group before, but it is now commonly known for a [[tribal group]] within [[Melanesia]] across the [[New Guinea Highlands|highlands of New Guinea]].

== Sexuality ==
It is commonly assumed that there is a sexual display element to wearing the koteka; however, according to the locals, kotekas are worn only to cover themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Attempted eradication ==
In 1971–1972 the Indonesian government launched "Operasi Koteka" ("Operation Penis Gourd") which consisted primarily of trying to encourage the people to wear shorts and shirts because such clothes were considered more "modern." But the people did not have changes of clothing, did not have soap, and were unfamiliar with the care of such clothes so the unwashed clothing caused skin diseases. There were also reports of men wearing the shorts as hats and the women using the dresses as carrying bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17388460.html|title=Cover up.(modernization programs in Iran Jaya province in Indonesia)|date=29 July 1995|publisher=The Economist (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the campaign was abandoned. Nevertheless, western clothing is required in government buildings, and children are required to wear western clothing in school.

== Different uses ==
[[File:Lonka-lonka.jpg|thumb|Lonka Lonka]]
Phallocrypts are decorative penis sheaths worn in parts of [[New Guinea]] during traditional ceremonies. They are usually made out of gourds or woven fibers and decorated with feathers, beads, [[cowry]] shells, and small metal ornaments. The most elaborate phallocrypts are sold to tourists as souvenirs and are not usually representative of ones actually used in ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

A phallocrypt can also be a simple ornament hung from male [[genitalia]] as part of a cultural expression, for ceremonial use or pure decoration. Among a number of ancient and modern people throughout the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] world, Africa and many parts of the Americas it was (and still is in some places) a common form of ornamentation. Some Aboriginal peoples of Australia wore an ornate carved pearl shell type called a Lonka Lonka. It is hung from the genitals by a twisted thong made of human hair. They are often ornately engraved with mainly geometric patterns and the grooves were colored with reddish ochre. Some South American cultures actually hung heavy, carved jade and other hardstone ornaments from piercings through the skin of their penis and scrotum. These were usually of a temporary ritualistic nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
===South America and Africa===
Some native South American tribes have used them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=X-AkAk9yW_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=penis+sheath+-Guinea+-koteka&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-7TftPfXAhWGBZoKHQxqB9UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=penis+sheath&amp;f=false|title=Advances in the Study of Behavior|date=26 March 1979|publisher=Academic Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in Brazil and the Amazon rainforest area.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=X-AkAk9yW_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=penis+sheath+-Guinea+-koteka&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-7TftPfXAhWGBZoKHQxqB9UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20sheath&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of penis gourds has also been documented in tropical Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Heiser CB (1979) The Gourd Book. University of Oklahoma Press, p. 145-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heiser CB (1973). The penis gourd of New Guinea. ''[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]]'' '''63''': 312–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Penis sheaths were sometimes worn by ancient Romans, often by singers since it was believed that it helped preserve their voice, but also by slaves or regular people to avoid sex.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=lSyY-OWFuGIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=roman+penis+fibula&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY6tTNzvbXAhXDF5oKHS73AbsQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20sheath&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

'''Neo-Aristotelianism''' is a view of [[literature]] and [[rhetorical criticism]] propagated by the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]]&lt;ref&gt;James P. Beasley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ocq0I7PbxiAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Prehistory of Rhetoric and Composition: New Rhetoric and Neo-Aristotelianism at the University of Chicago, 1947--1959]'', ProQuest, 2007, pp.129&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others &amp;mdash; which means.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A view of literature and criticism which takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/Neo-Aristotelianism.html
Definition from The University of Toronto National Library&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neo-Artistotelianism was one of the first rhetorical methods of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central features were first suggested in [[Herbert Wichelns|Herbert A. Wichelns]]' "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Herbert A.|last=Wichelns|author-link=Herbert Wichelns|editor-last=Drummond|editor-first=Alexander M.|title=The Literary Criticism of Oratory|encyclopedia=Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Neo-Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brigance|first=William Norwood|title=A History and Criticism of American Public Address|year=1943|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss.|first=Sonja K|title=. Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Aristotelianism "led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Literary Criticism of Oratory"==&lt;!-- The article Herbert Wichelns links here --&gt;
Wichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include:
* Speaker's personality 
* Character of the speaker (how the audience views a speaker) 
* [[Audience]] 
* Major ideas 
* Motives to which the speaker appealed 
* Nature of the speaker's proof (credibility) 
* Speaker's judgment of human nature in the audience 
* Arrangement 
* [[Stylistics (field of study)|Mode of expression]] 
* Speech preparation 
* Delivery 
* Effect of the [[discourse]] on the immediate audience and long-term effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wichelns|first=Herbert A.|title="The Literary Criticisms of Oratory," in Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" provided "substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klyn|first=Mark S.|title="Toward a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism," in Essays on Rhetorical Criticism|year=1968|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Donald C.|title=The Rhetorical Idiom: Essays in Rhetoric, Oratory, Language, and Drama|year=1958|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[romance languages]], '''''nomen à clef''''' or '''''nomen à clé''''' ({{IPA-fr|nomen‿a kle|}}, French for "name with a key"), is a [[name]] describing a real person, behind a façade of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxFomoeKT74C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=film+%C3%A0+clef&amp;lr=&amp;ei=mFMTS4H2FpCuzQSZ3737DA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The films in my life" By François Truffaut, Da Capo Press, 1994, ISBN 0-306-80599-5, ISBN 978-0-306-80599-8, pg 131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Key" in this context means a table one can use to swap out the names.  
It is the nomenclature complement of the [[roman à clef]].

An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.

In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Cinema''''' (also called '''''On Cinema at the Cinema''''' for the video series) is an [[United States|American]] comedic film review [[podcast]] and [[web series]] starring [[Tim Heidecker]] and [[Gregg Turkington]]. The duo appear as a pair of hapless movie reviewers (using their own names). The show started as an independently released [[podcast]] from 2011 to 2013, before being picked up as a professionally produced web video series by [[Thing X]] in 2012–13 for its first two seasons, and then moving to [[Adult Swim.com]] in 2013. It has aired 10 seasons, plus one special
season titled "The Trial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/11/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-your-new-siskel-ebert/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Your New Siskel &amp; Ebert |publisher=[[Splitsider]] |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''On Cinema'' spawned a spinoff web series in its fifth season, ''[[Decker (series)|Decker]],'' a simultaneous spoof of political-thrillers and homebrew video intended for the web. It later became a [[TV series]], and as of 2018, it has aired 6 seasons of episodes total on Adultswim.com and [[Adult Swim]].

Heidecker and Turkington began making the podcast as a prank and a mockery of the "self-indulgence" of the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/01/25/faux-movie-review-web-series-cinema-cinema-develops-real-future/ |title=Faux movie-review web series 'On Cinema at the Cinema' develops a real future |publisher=Dailycal.org |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Heidecker and Turkington have created an immersive universe through ''On Cinema'' and ''Decker.'' A live [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] special is also done every year, streamed via [[YouTube]], with interactive elements for fans, such as polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2014/02/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-doing-a-live-oscars-special/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Doing a Live Oscars Special |publisher=Splitsider |date=2014-02-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several seasons of ''On Cinema'' have discernible multi-episode plot arcs as Heidecker and Turkington explore the dynamic and characters they have created both in the series' episodes and, simultaneously, on social media, through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="mocktrial"&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker is putting himself on trial for murder right now as part of On Cinema's latest absurd twist"|url=https://www.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-is-putting-himself-on-trial-for-murder-ri-1820494473|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=15 November 2017|author=William Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who play along with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads". Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where they appear in character and interact with fans.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web|title="'Decker,' 'On Cinema' and the various, intertwined universes of comedian Tim Heidecker"|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-tim-heidecker-20170609-story.html|publisher=''[[The L.A. Times]]''|date=9 June 2017|author=Robert Llyod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Summer of 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe and special content.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-taking-on-cinema-1826240596 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington are taking On Cinema At The Cinema to cinemas |last=Barsanti |first=Sam |website=''[[The A.V.

==Premise==
Early audio episodes of ''On Cinema'' were quite short, frequently no more than one or two minutes long. Heidecker and Turkington would "review" films on these podcasts without actually providing any meaningful information or critical insight. Nearly every film that has been discussed or mentioned on ''On Cinema'' since the podcast's inception has received a "5 bags of popcorn" rating on a scale of five from the two reviewers, regardless of its reception elsewhere in the press or with the viewing public.

With the series' growth into an online video series, episodes grew to an average length of eight to twelve minutes. Although reviewing films remains a central conceit, the focus of the series quickly shifted from a mockery of amateur podcasting to an extended character study of the two podcasters. Heidecker, in character on ''On Cinema'', frequently uses his time on camera to discuss anything on his character's mind except film, especially his bizarre ailments, personal crises, and [[Conservatism in the United States|right-wing political views]], or to simply berate and belittle Turkington. Turkington's character fancies himself a "film expert," his primary qualification being an enormous collection of forgotten and arguably forgettable mainstream films from the 1980s and 1990s on [[VHS]]. The series continues to provide reviews that purposely offer no real critical insight. Recent seasons as of 2018 have seen Tim lose interest in reviewing and start a band first named ''Dekkar'' then ''DKR'' .

Guest appearances  have included [[Jordan Hoffman]], [[Jimmy McNichol]], [[Joe Estevez]], [[Lawrence Turman]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Mark Proksch]], [[John Aprea]], [[Peyton Reed]], and [[Nicholas Meyer]], some of whom also appear in the ''[[Decker (TV series)|Decker]]'' series.

==Series overview==

{{:List of On Cinema episodes}}

===Podcast===
The ''On Cinema'' podcast was produced independently by Tim and Gregg. The podcast consists of Tim, along with Gregg as a "special guest" for every episode, covering movies poorly and with little insight, and often engaging in arguments. Gregg later developed a more pretentious "film buff" persona, and Tim took a turn to being obnoxiously political, sometimes devoting entire episodes to conspiracy theories, much to the chagrin of Gregg.

Another running joke that was carried over to the video series is Gregg's refusal to believe that ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is really "Star Trek II," instead often believing stubbornly that ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' is the real Star Trek II.

===Season 1===
Starting this season, the show is now in video format via [[Thing X]].com, as well as having its name changed to ''On Cinema at the Cinema''. The series is similar to the podcast, but this time episodes always take place on a set meant to look like a movie theatre. Gregg is still never acknowledged as more than a guest each episode, and starts his weekly segments "Popcorn Classics" and "On Cinema On Location" where he brings in obscure, forgotten VHS movies to showcase and travels to filming locations of obscure movies, respectively. Tim begins using "60 second soap box" to talk about current political issues with a conservative narrative, much to the continued annoyance of Gregg. With the start of the web series, Tim uses a rating scale of "bags of popcorn" ranging from 0–5, and while Gregg uses five as a max, Tim often goes overboard giving scores of "6 bags" or even more, creating tension and confusion throughout the season. Most of the films reviewed get a score of at least "5 bags" from both reviewers.

===Season 2===
Tim reveals he has [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] in his brain but does not want to get surgery because of "side effects, the whole medical industry, and [[Obamacare]]" while Gregg pushes for him to get surgery. In episode 208, Tim introduces the first special guest, Ayaka, a foreign exchange student from Japan staying with Tim's family.

The first Live On Cinema Oscar Special airs, where Tim and Gregg live stream during the [[Oscars]] and drink alcohol. Tim gets very drunk and throws up on some of Gregg's VHS tapes which causes Gregg to walk off the set.

===Season 3===
Season 3 moved the series from [[Thing X]] to [[Adultswim.com]]. The season begins with Tim in a head bandage and clearly in physical pain as he went through with surgery for his blood clots. As a result of him going through the surgery, Tim's wife divorces him and this is the last time his family is referred to throughout the series. Gregg begins his goal of making the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' by becoming the first person in history to watch 500 movies in 500 days. Tim kicks Gregg off the show after Gregg drives all the way from [[Hollywood]] to [[San Francisco]] to make a video alleging the location of a ''[[Star Trek]]'' filming location, after he and Tim had disagreed on it before. [[John Aprea]] and Ayaka are guests on the next episode, where Tim reveals he is dating Ayaka and says he loves her for the first time. In the season finale, Gregg returns to the show as Ayaka was deported back to Japan.

===Season 4===
Tim begins season four with many health problems and introduces his personal doctor, Dr. San (played by [[Zac Holtzman]]), an alternative medical doctor treating Tim with [[acupuncture]], [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] and other "natural" medicines. Dr. San begins coming onto the set with Tim, despite Gregg's objections. However, Tim's face becomes infected from the acupuncture and he denounces Dr. San.

Ayaka sends a letter to Tim on the show saying she is pregnant with Tim's child.

The second Live Oscar Special, Tim and Gregg drink (with Tim getting much drunker than Gregg). We are introduced to [[Mark Proksch]] who does impersonations of [[W.C. Fields]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].

===Season 5===
Tim moves to [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]] and buys a motorcycle to commute back and forth between there and Hollywood for the On Cinema taping.

Tim announces that Ayaka has had an [[abortion]], despite remaining [[pro-life]] on the topic, saying "when you are in that situation, choices have to be on the table." However, Gregg brings Ayaka onto On Cinema via [[Skype]] from Japan, revealing she did go through with the pregnancy and naming the boy Tom Cruise Heidecker Junior, after the actor [[Tom Cruise]]. Ayaka moves back to America with Tom Cruise Junior and into Gregg's apartment. This upsets Tim and he moves permanently to Jackson Hole. He makes Gregg host of the show and hands off all responsibilities to him in the season finale.

===Season 6===
Gregg begins his first season as host, but after he is unable to find a guest, he records himself having conversations with himself and plays VHS video of his conversation during the episode.

Tim returns as host in episode 602 after he realized his new friends in Jackson Hole were [[white supremacists]]. He rekindles his relationship with Ayaka and moves into Gregg's apartment with her and Tom Cruise Junior. In the season finale, Tim proposes to Ayaka and she accepts.

The third Live Oscar Special airs, while Tim and Gregg get drunk and Tim, once again, gets much drunker than Gregg and becomes belligerent. [[Peyton Reed]] comes on the Special to promote his new film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and announces that Gregg has been cast as a minor character in the movie, which upsets Tim. In the finale segment, Gregg introduces [[James Dean]], the former actor who was believed to be dead since 1955. After reading on a message board about how Dean faked his own death and wrote a memoir called "I'm Alive: How I Faked my own Death" he brings Dean on set as his return to the public. Tim does not believe this is the real James Dean, leading to him verbally and physically threatening Dean before trashing the set.

===Season 7===
Gregg moves to [[Victorville, California]] and opens the Victorville Film Archives in a storage locker, where he also lives.

Tim gives ''Ant-Man'' a rare one-bag of popcorn which upsets Gregg, leading to him accusing Tim of paying $15,000 to have a minor role in the new ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' movie, which Tim denies.

After meeting a man at [[Guitar Center]] named Axiom, Tim starts a rock band named "Dekkar" with him. Their debut single Empty Bottle is released on the show, which upsets Gregg as it is not movie related and was played instead of his Popcorn Classic segment.

Gregg tells Tim that Dr. San, who Tim has been looking for since he infected Tim's face with dirty needles in acupuncture in season four, is Ayaka's boss at her job. Tim walks off the set angry that he had not realized this. However, the next episode is "The Doctor San Forgiveness Special" where both Tim and Dr. San forgive each other. Dr. San takes over as Tom Cruise Junior's new [[Pediatrics|pediatric doctor]].

By the season seven finale, Tim announces that Tom Cruise Junior has died. He plays a musical tribute to his son with Axiom and Dr. San.

The fourth Live Oscar Special is the biggest one yet, with periodic musical performances by Dekkar (much to the annoyance of Gregg), the "Oscar Olympics" featuring three games, officiated by [[Joe Estevez]], and a DNA test by Dr. San of James Dean, which proves that he is in fact, James Dean. Tim hides the fact he has been drinking alcohol during the Special while no one else is, and he becomes angered by the DNA results. He proceeds to kick Dr. San off the set. An animated rendering of Tom Cruise Junior as a young adult comes on stage, in which Tim and the animated Tom Cruise Junior come out [[Anti-vaccination|against vaccination]].

===Season 8===
Season eight moves the show to Victorville, where Tim has now moved into the storage unit with Gregg. They both buy an abandoned [[movie theater]] and open it as the "Victorville Film Center" where instead of playing new releases, a nightly showing from Gregg's VHS collection of Popcorn Classics is played. Attendance is minimal because of the obscurity of the films. Mark Proksch is hired as a concessions cashier.

Dr. San prescribes Tim a "nutritional vape system" in which Tim replaces all meals and food with an [[electronic cigarette]] full of supposed nutrients. However, Tim's physical condition worsens as the season progresses, as he comes to the set sweating, bruised, hallucinating, and unfocused. Despite this, he continues to use his nutritional vape system. After he cannot take the physical pain and symptoms of the vape system, Tim goes to an actual doctor who informs him the vape and his blood is full of [[Lsd]], [[cocaine]], and multiple other drugs – both legal and illegal. Tim quits the vape system and swears off Dr. San once again. Tim announces that Ayaka is pregnant with their second child. After Tim tries to get Ayaka to get an abortion, she leaves him and moves back to Japan. Tim begins a romantic relationship with Axiom's sister, Juliana.

A fire is started in the storage unit after Tim's vape pen overheats one night, burning the entire facility down including the Victorville Film Archive. Tim suffers [[third degree burn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on all of his body, including his face and hands. After insurance will not cover the cost of the fire, he returns to the show in bandages so he can keep working to pay for the damages and lawsuits, which exceed $1,000,000 according to Gregg.

However, in Tim's return to On Cinema, he is surprised by an intervention by Gregg, Joe Estevez, John Aprea, Mark Proksch, Ayaka, Ayaka's father, and Axiom. They encourage Tim to live a healthier life, which upsets Tim. He yells and kicks everyone but Axiom out, and announces plans to start an [[electronic music]] version of Dekkar, now called "DKR".

The season finale ends with a remixed, electronic version of Empty Bottle and Tim announcing that Juliana is now pregnant with his child while Ayaka will go through with her pregnancy too.

===Season 9===
Season nine begins with Gregg informing the audience that the Victorville Film Center has burnt down while he speculates Tim may have done it to collect insurance money.

After Gregg and Tim move back to Hollywood, Tim opens up "Six Bag Cinemas", a new movie theater concept with recliner chairs and a waiter (who is Mark) that brings food to customers during the movie. Gregg constantly criticizes the theater and food.

After Tim stops using the facial cream for the burns on his face, his skin dies and he needs a [[skin transplant]]. After a selection process in which Tim volunteers most of the potential donors himself, Manuel from DKR is chosen and donates skin off of his lower back and buttocks to Tim.

Tim and Dr. San are arrested and jailed on [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]] charges. At Tim's "Electric Sun Desert Music Festival" in [[Apple Valley, California]], Dr. San allegedly gave out free samples of his nutritional vape system, the same one Tim uses, resulting in 20 deaths.  Gregg takes over as host with Mark as his co-host, and the two spend an entire episode blaming Tim instead of reviewing movies.

Tim returns on [[bail]], and finishes the last three episodes of the season with Turkington. Together with his lawyer, Doug Lyman, Tim has decided to pin the 20 deaths on Dr. San and the Apple Valley authorities who did not respond in time. In the season finale, it is revealed that Dr. San has committed suicide in jail, and that the relatives of the 20 who died are now primarily blaming Tim for the deaths. At the end of the final episode, Tim reveals to Gregg that he will never forget what Gregg said about him on the show, no matter what happens to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-s-movie-review-serie-1798257567 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington's movie review series returns next month |website=[[The A.V. Club]]}} by ''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trial===
A special event, titled "The Trial", began on November 15, 2017, streaming on Adult Swim's website with the trial of Tim Heidecker for the death of the "Electric Sun 20". Tim was found not guilty of the death of one of the 20, as that victim died of a heroin overdose. A [[mistrial]] was called for the remaining 19, due to a [[hung jury]] with 11 guilty and 1 not guilty verdicts. Gregg accused Tim of bribing the juror who voted not guilty.

Director and writer [[Nicholas Meyer]] appears as one of the testifiers in an ongoing joke alluding to a long-standing disagreement between Tim and Gregg as to whether or not San Francisco is the setting for the film "Star Trek II." &lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;

===Season X ===
During the Fifth Oscar Special, Mark got locked tight into a [[standard diving dress]] while doing an impression of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] character in the [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] movie and had to be hospitalized for [[asphyxiation]].

Tim returns from the trial free from prison but facing a [[civil suit]] from one of the families of the Electric Sun 19. His assets, including On Cinema and Decker, are being seized and he claims he might soon be facing bankruptcy. After threatening to commit suicide and with help from his attorney (Mark Dwyer), Tim manages to convince the Delgado family to let him try to earn money for them with his various assets. The Delgado's and Tim's Attorney like the show after Episode 7, and hire Gregg as the managing editor of the newly incorporated Delgado Media Holding company, effectively giving him creative control on On Cinema.

The intro and production set have been upgraded, and the show now has a sponsor by name of Rio Jenesis,&lt;ref name="riojenesis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riojenesis.com/ |title=Rio Jenesis |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a protein shake company that creates a "germ shield", of which Tim is now consuming. Gregg begins writing letters to [[Tim Burton]], questioning why he didn't work with [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]''. He also announces that he has resurrected his film archives, which appears to be several bins full of VHS tapes (later revealed to be stocked in Mark Proksch hospital room) and is now collecting and wearing movie promotional hats to Tim's vocal displeasure. Episodes 4 through 6 were filmed in [[360-degree video]].

As of Episode 7, the show has returned to form with a stronger focus on movies than it had previously had in the last several seasons. However, this is in the context of Tim needing to turn the show around, with him openly discussing the possibility of suicide if it doesn't become more successful. The next three episodes, 8–10, saw Gregg's role on the show increasingly become that of the host, while Tim's role was diminished, allowing for more of Gregg's segments, including Popcorn Classics, to become larger segments in each episode. These changes coincided with Gregg's new role as the managing editor in On Cinema's parent company.  In episode 10, the season finale, Tim threw a fit of rage and insulted the Delgados while announcing his wish to campaign for the post of [[district attorney]] of the [[San Bernardino County]].

==Production==
Heidecker has stated that On Cinema was started out of a desire to mock the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"/&gt; The first episode was recorded on set of ''[[The Comedy]]'', where Heidecker and Turkington were working together, after Heidecker proposed the idea between takes.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;
In April 2017, On Cinema initiated a [[Patreon]] page for funding, most of it going to the Oscar specials, with some of the higher options including receiving producer credits, walk-on roles for the Oscar specials, or live custom [[Skype]] reviews from [[Gregg Turkington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.patreon.com/oncinema On Cinema Patreon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who interact with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads" in the frequent personal conflicts between the hosts which are often only tangentially, if at all, related to films or cinema.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; During the annual live Oscar special, Tim and Gregg both frequently provide interactive elements via online polls for fans to vote on. This cult following is especially found on [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], the latter through Gregg and Tim's respective profiles, of which Gregg has completely devoted to the persona of his alter-ego. Heidecker and Turkington have also appeared in character on the podcasts ''Kreative Kontrol'' and ''[[Best Show]]'' in 2015 and 2017.

Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where new episodes of ''Decker'' are shown to fans and the cast appears as their "On Cinema" characters to field questions.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;

In 2013 the ''On Cinema Film Guide'' app was released, featuring the voices of Turkington and Heidecker reviewing over 17,000 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild |first=Matt |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkingtons-emon-cinemaem--97166 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington’s On Cinema is now a very meta app|publisher=Avclub.com |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For "The Trial", Heidecker and Turkington upended the traditional review aspect of the series, and staged an elaborate mock event where Tim's character was "on trial for murder" that lasted over a week. It received acclaim from observers, some of whom called it "brilliant" and "ambitious."&lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker Is On Trial For Murder in Adult Swim's Latest Web Stunt"|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/tim-heidecker-is-on-trial-for-murder-in-adult-swim.html|publisher=''[[Paste Magazine]]''|date=8 November 2017|author=Jim Vorel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denofgeekoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim’s On Cinema Has Become A Murder Trial|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/on-cinema/269227/adult-swim-s-on-cinema-has-become-a-murder-trial|publisher=''[[Den of Geek]]''|date=25 November 2017|author=Daniel Kurland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim Is Broadcasting a Multi-Day Fake Murder Trial for Tim Heidecker|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/11/on-cinema-tim-heidecker-murder-trial|publisher=[[Spin Magazine]]|date= November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Touring ==
In 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe such as [[Joe Estevez]], the band ''Dekkar'' and special content created only for the tour, such as a live reviewing of all mid-2018 major release films: [[Superfly (2018 film)|''Superfly'']], ''[[Mission Impossible: Fallout]]'', ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'', ''[[Sicario 2: Soldado]]'', ''[[Ant Man &amp; The Wasp]]''.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naftule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portlandmercury.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consequenceofsound.net"/&gt;

"'''On Denoting'''" is an essay by [[Bertrand Russell]]. It was published in the philosophy journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1905. In it, Russell introduces and advocates his theory of denoting phrases, according to which definite descriptions and other "denoting phrases ... never have any meaning in themselves, but every proposition in whose verbal expression they occur has a meaning."&lt;ref name="Russell 480"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell  | first = Bertrand  | authorlink = Bertrand Russell   | coauthors =   | title = On Denoting  | journal = Mind  | volume = 14  | issue = 56  | pages = 479-493  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = October 1905  | jstor = 2248381 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory later became the basis for Russell's [[descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] with regard to proper names, and his view that proper names are "disguised" or "abbreviated" [[definite descriptions]].

In the 1920s, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] referred to the essay as "that paradigm of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' entry ''Descriptions'', [[Peter Ludlow]] singled the essay out as "''the'' paradigm of philosophy", and called it a work of "tremendous insight"; provoking discussion and debate among philosophers of language and linguists for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Peter, "Descriptions", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/descriptions/
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "denoting phrase"==

===Russell's concept of a denoting phrase===

For Russell, a denoting phrase is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]], whose [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas [[Frege]] held that there were two distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its [[Sense and reference|''Sinn'' and ''Bedeutung'']]), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (''Sinn'') and replaces it with the idea of a [[propositional function]] (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the sort of thing that he had in mind: "a man, any man, every man, the present [[King of France]]... the centre of mass of the [[Solar System]], ...." So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article "the" at the beginning), which "does not denote anything" (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not [[referring expression]]s but rather, to borrow a term later coined by [[Keith Donnellan]], they have "attributive" uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are "general" in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.

===Reference to something that does not exist===

However, at the very beginning of the article, Russell distinguishes between cases where "a phrase may be denoting and yet not denote anything (e.g. 'the present King of France')" and cases where they may denote "one definite object (such as '[[:Edward VII|the present King of England]]')". If this passage is interpreted as saying that descriptions may "refer" to one definite object, then it could be that Russell actually recognised the two distinct uses of definite descriptions (attributive and referential) that Donnellan later proposed.

=== Epistemology ===

In any case, after clarifying the sense of the term "denoting phrase" and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: [[knowledge by description]] and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|knowledge by (direct) acquaintance]]. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge of everything else (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions.

==The theory of descriptions==

=== Mathematical description ===
Russell starts out by defining the "fundamental" notion of a ''[[propositional function]]''. This is basically a modified version of Frege's idea of ''unsaturated concepts''. Hence, "''C''(''x'') stands for a proposition in which ''x'' is a constituent and where ''x'', the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined." The notions of ''everything'', ''nothing'' and ''something'' ("the most primitive of denoting phrases") can then be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; C(E) \leftrightarrow \forall x C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(N) \leftrightarrow \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(S) \leftrightarrow \lnot \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' stands for everything, ''N'' stands for nothing and ''S'' stands for something. ''All'' is taken as primitive and indefinable and the others are defined in terms of it. Russell emphasises that these notions can have no meaning apart from that which is assigned to them within the propositions in which they occur, all of which are meaningful. This is the foundation of Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] as he proceeds to illustrate.

===Illustration===

The phrase "the [[:Charles I of England|father]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (F) was executed (E)" is interpreted as the following quantificational assertion:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( \left( F \left( x \right) \land  \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow x=y \right) \right) \land E \left( x \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, there is one and only one thing x such that x is the father of Charles II and x was executed.

So, if C represents any statement at all about the father of Charles II, the statement 'C (the father of Charles II)' always implies:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( F \left( x \right) \land \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow  x=y \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that if there is not one and only one entity that satisfies the above, then every proposition that contains the descriptions in a primary occurrence is false.  (If the mother of Charles II was ‘unfaithful’ the statement may be false.)  In this way, Russell points out, it will turn out that all statements containing non-referring descriptions (e.g. "The present king of [[Samothrace]] is
a great writer") are false. Russell's theory reduces all propositions that contain definite descriptions into forms that do not.

==Meinong==
He then criticises [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]'s theory of objects which, according to Russell, is ontologically promiscuous and self-contradictory. Both of these criticisms stem from Meinong's theory that there is an object, whether it exists or subsists, for every set of properties. Therefore, there is an object that is both round and not round, or round and square. Russell argues that Meinong's theory entails conclusions such as "the present King of France" both exists and does not exist. However, Meinong does not attribute existence (or any other sort of being) to ''non-existent objects''. Russell also accuses Meinong of violating the law of non-contradiction by asserting that the "round square" is both round and not round. Meinong, on the other hand, maintains that the laws of logic do not apply to such phenomena as "impossible" objects that have no being.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann, Reinhardt. "Alexius Meinong". ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (ed.) Ted Honderich. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolving the problem of negative existentials==
One of the fundamental puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions is the problem of non-referring expressions or, as they are now called, negative [[Existential clause|existentials]]. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls ''primary'' and ''secondary'' occurrences of denoting phrases.

===Statements about concepts where the object does not exist===

Since definite descriptions are just quantificational devices on Russell's view they can enter into scope relations with other logical operators. In the case of negative existentials, there is an ambiguity between two different (primary and secondary) readings of the quantificational assertion. For example, Russell uses the case of "the present King of France is not bald." Here the two possible readings are:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land \lnot B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lnot \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

In the first case, the statement is false because it quantifies over non-existent entities. In the second case, the statement is true because it is not the case that there is a present King of France. "Thus all propositions in which 'the King of France' has a primary occurrence are false: the denials of such propositions are true, but in them 'the King of France' has a secondary occurrence." Contemporarily, it is customary to discuss Russell's primary/secondary distinction in the more logically exact terms of wide and narrow scope. The scope distinction regards the operator that, on one reading, modifies ''only'' the subject, and on the other, modifies the entire sentence.

===Ambiguity===

Russell resolves the problem of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: "[[:George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] wondered whether [[Walter Scott|Scott]] is the author of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]''." In this case, it is obvious that King George is not wondering whether Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the ''de dicto'' / ''de re'' ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence "George IV wondered whether Scott is Sir Walter" can be interpreted as:

:''George IV wondered whether the x that... is identical to the y that....''

where "..." stands for some definite description such as "the clever fellow who wrote Ivanhoe" and ....stands for something like "the elegant gentleman seated next to the Princess". In the ''de re'' case, the above sentence can be interpreted as follows instead:

:''the x that... is such that King George wondered whether x is identical to the y that....''

===Fictional names===

Finally, Russell suggests that fictional names such as "[[Apollo]]" can be treated as abbreviated definite descriptions that refer to nothing. All propositions that contain names of such fictional entities are to be treated in the same manner as the negative existentials described above.

==Criticisms==
In his essay, "On Referring", [[P. F. Strawson]] criticised Russell's characterisation of statements where the object does not exist, such as "the present King of France", as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, are neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine the meaning of a sentence. To give the meaning of an expression is to "give general directions for its use."&lt;ref name="Strawson 327"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P. F.  | authorlink = P. F. Strawson   | coauthors =   | title = On Referring  | journal = Mind  | volume = 59  | issue = 235  | pages = 327  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = July 1950  | jstor = 2251176 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Strawson argued that, were someone to say the King of France was wise, we would not say their statement is true or false, but, rather, decide they must be under a misapprehension since, normally, the question would not arise as there is no King of France.&lt;ref name="Strawson 330"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P. F.  | authorlink = P. F.

Strawson also argued that we often need to know the use of a word to understand its meaning, such as in statements of the form, "The table is covered with books." In normal use, the expression would be referring to one particular table. It is false, Strawson believed, to think, as Russell, that the phrase will only have meaning insofar as there is only one table and no more. The phrase has application in virtue of the fact that one table and no more is what is being referred to, and it is understood that the table is what is being referenced.&lt;ref name="Strawson 332"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P.

{{literature}}
A '''play''' is a form of [[literature]] written by a [[playwright]], usually consisting of [[dialogue]] and singing between [[Character (arts)|characters]], intended for [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] rather than just [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theater]], to [[Community theatre]], as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably [[George Bernard Shaw]], who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term "play" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/play "Play"]: [[Dictionary.com]] website.

==Genres==

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. [[Comedy|Comedies]] were one of the two original play types of [[Ancient Greece]], along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', or for a more modern example the skits from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchon.tripod.com/indexGREEKTH.html|title=THE ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA &amp; THEATRE HISTORY PAGE|publisher=anarchon.tripod.com|accessdate=2008-06-16|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatrehist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates001.html|title=Origin of Comedy|publisher=www.theatrehistory.com|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farce====
{{Main article|Farce}}
A generally nonsensical genre of play, [[farce]]s are often acted and often involve  humor. An example of a farce includes [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', or [[Mark Twain]]'s play ''[[Is He Dead?]]''.

====Satirical====
{{Main article|Satire}}
A [[satirical|satire]] play takes a comic look at current events  people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out [[corruption]]. An example of a satire would be [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.

====Restoration comedy====
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
Restoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.F.|title=Marriage of Convenience and the Moral Code of Restoration Comedy|journal=Essays of Criticism|date=1962|pages=370–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content.  However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.

It is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in [[Molière]]’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ornament of Action|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre.  This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century.  However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Styan|first1=J.L.|title=Restoration Comedy in Performance|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
These plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the [[protagonist]] of the play has a [[tragic flaw]], a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. [[Tragedy]] was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', and also [[John Webster]]'s play ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon" /&gt;

These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. [[History]] as a separate genre was popularized by [[William Shakespeare]]. Examples of historical plays include [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' and William Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3b2tlWBBUsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Shakespeare+popularised%22+historical+play | title=The Three Richards: Richard I ... - Google Book Search|publisher=books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17|last=|first=| isbn=978-1-85285-521-5| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
Ballad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies.  The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production.  Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly.  For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs.  When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.

By the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordman|first1=Gerald|title=American Musical Theatre|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include ''Wicked'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

===Theatre of Cruelty===
This theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.”  In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.

Above all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication.  Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content.  Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something.  His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective.  Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.

His plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany.  Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw.  Much of his work was banned in France at the time.

Artaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II.  For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body.  This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finter|first1=Helga|last2=Griffin|first2=Matthew|title=Antonin Artaud and the Impossible Theatre: The Legacy of the Theatre of Cruelty|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
Theatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions.  Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition.  Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them.  This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.

One of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language.  Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.

Famous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esslin|first1=Martin|title=Theatre of the Absurd|date=2001|isbn=1-4000-7523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "play" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term "straight play" is used in contrast to "[[musical theatre|musical]]", which refers to a play based on [[music]], [[dance]], and [[song]]s sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term "playlet" is sometimes used.

[[Image:roberto busa e index thomisticus.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Roberto Busa - 2006 - In the background the Index Thomisticus]]

==Biography==
Born in [[Vicenza]], the second of five children, he attended primary school in [[Bolzano]] and grammar school in [[Verona]] and in [[Belluno]]. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope John Paul I]]. In 1933 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled "The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of [[Ontology]], [[Theodicy]] and [[Scientific methodology|Scientific Methodology]] and, for some years, a librarian in the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy of [[Gallarate]].

==The ''Index Thomisticus''==
In 1946 he planned the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with [[Thomas J. Watson]], the founder of [[IBM]], and was able to persuade him to sponsor the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the ''Index Thomisticus''. In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age web-based version] made its debut, sponsored by the Fundación Tomás de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarcón and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the [http://itreebank.marginalia.it ''Index Thomisticus'' Treebank] project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus.

==The Busa Prize==
The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) awards the "Busa Prize", which honors leaders in the field of [[digital humanities|humanities computing]]. The
first Busa Prize was awarded in 1998 to Busa himself. Later winners include:  

* John Burrows (Australia) (presented in 2001, New York, New York, USA)
* [[Susan Hockey]] (UK) (presented in 2004, Gothenburg, Sweden)

==Recent projects==
Before his death, Busa had been teaching at the Papal [[Gregorian University]] in Rome, at the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy in [[Gallarate]], and at the Catholic Sacred Heart University in [[Milan]]. He was also working at the LTB project (LTB stands for Bicultural Thomistic Lexicon), which aims at understanding the Latin concepts used by Thomas Aquinas in the terms of contemporary culture.

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

A '''singing telegram''' is a message that is delivered by an [[artist]] in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal [[telegram]]s, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.

[[Western Union]], the American [[telegraph]] company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star [[Rudy Vallee]] a birthday greeting by telegram. [[George P. Oslin]] (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108220256/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  | author=Liz Sadler }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
A '''DIY singing telegram''' is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Kissogram===
A '''kissogram''', also called '''kissagram''' (short for kissing [[telegram]]), is a [[message]] delivered along with a [[kiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/kissogram |title=Definition of kissogram |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an [[Employment agency|agency]]. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a [[police officer]], [[nurse]], [[french maid]] or [[nun]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a197176/new-who-companion-has-kissogram-job/|title=New 'Who' companion 'has kissogram job'|date=2010-01-18|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stripogram===
A '''stripogram''' or '''strippergram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strippergram|title=strippergram - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of message delivery in which a [[stripper]] will perform a [[striptease]] while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of [[telegram]] and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thecelebratedmisterk|title=Newsroom Stripper|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lusr48t3cBM|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a [[birthday]], [[anniversary]] or [[bachelor party]].  A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

==Star System==
In the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to [[Florists' Transworld Delivery]], the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife.  

In the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Sam Lowry ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.

In ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', 1985, a singing telegram ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. 

In a classic episode of [[Sesame Street]], Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]] singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.

In the 1987 [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]] episode "Soft Touch", [[Penny Parker]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'', 1991, Parry ([[Robin Williams]]) sends a singing telegram ([[Michael Jeter]]) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.

In the 2010 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Amy Pond]] worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">'''Teichoscopy''' or teichoscopia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm Teichoscopy&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "viewing from the walls," is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's ''[[Iliad]],'' Book 3, lines 121-244.

The passage begins with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] approached in her chamber by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], disguised as her sister-in-law [[Laodice (mythology)|Laodice]], the daughter of [[Priam]]. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between [[Menelaus]] and [[Paris]].  Helen identifies [[Agamemnon]], [[Odysseus]], [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian (Greater) Ajax]], and [[Idomeneus]].  She also mentions that she does not see her brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to [[Zeus]] and the rest of the gods on [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to open the action.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to Ancient Narratives''.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the 'author' of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors."&lt;ref&gt;Pantelia, Maria C. ''Helen and the Last Song for Hector.'' Transactions of the American Philological Association 132.1-2 (2002) 21-27 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/transactions_of_the_american_philological_association/v132/132.1pantelia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Menelaus]], would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/iliad3.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although [[Homer]] is not at the beginning of the [[Trojan War]], he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.

Although teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen.  Helen’s open admiration of both the Greek and [[Troy|Trojan]] warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint.  He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”&lt;ref&gt;Remarks on Counterpoint Characterization in Euripides.  Frederic Will.  ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 8. (May, 1960), pp. 338-344.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3294564].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in [[dramaturgy]].

Natural phenomena, too, may be conveyed by this device. Far-off drama such as the sun rising, or a description of stars across the firmament lend themselves to this treatment.

'''''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended''''' is an approximately 87,000-word composition written by Sir [[Isaac Newton]], first published posthumously in 1728 in limited supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last= Newton |title=The chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended : To Which is Prefix'd, A Short Chronicle From the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great  |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-37430|year=1728|publisher= Printed for J. Tonson ; J. Osborn ; T. Longman |place=London |edition=1 |volume=|access-date= June 17, 2016| via=e-rara.ch (ETH-Bibliothek Zürich)|doi= 10.3931/e-rara-37430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it had been republished in mass paperback format.  The work represents one of Newton's forays into the topic of [[chronology]], detailing the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms throughout antiquity.

The treatise is composed of eight primary sections.  First is an introductory letter to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] by Newton's estate manager [[John Conduitt]], followed by a short advertisement.  After this is found a section entitled "''A Short Chronicle''" which serves as a brief historical list of events listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest listed date of 1125 BC and the most recent listed at 331 BC.  The majority of the treatise, however, is in the form of six chapters that explore the history of specific civilizations.  These chapters are titled:

*Chap. I. Of the Chronology of the First Ages of the Greeks.
*Chap. II. Of the Empire of Egypt.
*Chap. III. Of the Assyrian Empire.
*Chap. IV. Of the two Contemporary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes.
*Chap. V. A Description of the Temple of Solomon.
*Chap. VI. Of the Empire of the Persians.

According to John Conduitt's introductory letter, ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' was Isaac Newton's last personally revised work before his death but had actually been written much earlier.  Some of its subject material and contents have led many people to categorize this work as one of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].

==Summary==

The book attempts to revise the accepted ancient chronology of Newton's day, in order to prove that [[Solomon]] was the earliest king in the world, and that his Temple the first ever built, with all others being copies, beginning with [[Sesostris]], King of Egypt, followed by others. Newton's results, therefore, diverge widely from presently accepted dates, often more widely than the system that he attempted to displace.

Newton attempted to [[Euhemerism|identify various mythological figures as historical]] or Biblical individuals, such as arguing that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was [[Noah]], the [[Sky deity|god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was [[Shem]], and [[Osiris]] and [[Dionysus]] were [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref name="Ernest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/Newton.pdf |title=Review of Newton and the Origin of Civilization, by Jed Z.

The '''Third-person effect''' &lt;ref name=Davison1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davison|first=W.|title=The third-person effect in communication|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1983|volume=47|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1086/268763}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hypothesis]]  predicts that people tend to perceive that [[Mass communication|mass media]] messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal [[bias]]es. The Third-person effect manifests itself through an individual’s overestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on the generalized other, or an underestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on themselves.

These types of perceptions stem from a self-motivated social desirability (not feeling influenced by mass messages promotes [[self-esteem]]), a social-distance [[corollary]] (choosing to dissociate oneself from the others who may be influenced) and a perceived exposure to a message (others choose to be influenced by [[persuasive]] communication).&lt;ref name="Davison1983"/&gt; Other names for the effect are "Third-person perception" and "Web Third-person effect". From 2015 the effect named "Web Third-person effect" when it is verified in social media, media websites, blogs and in websites in general.&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonopoulos|first=Nikos|title=Web Third-person effect in structural aspects of the information on media websites|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2015|volume=44|issue=3|pages=48–58|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.022|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations and Articulation of the Hypothesis==

Sociologist W. Phillips Davison, who first articulated the third-person effect hypothesis in 1983, explains that the phenomenon first piqued his interest in 1949 or 1950 upon learning of a Japanese attempt during [[World War II]] to dissuade black U.S. soldiers from fighting at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] using propaganda.  As Davison recounts, the leaflets stressed that the Japanese did not have a quarrel with the black soldiers and that they should give up or desert.  Although there was no indication that the leaflets had any effect on the soldiers, the incident preceded a substantial reshuffle among the officers and the unit was withdrawn the next day.&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

Several years later while interviewing [[West Germany|West German]] journalists to determine the influence of the press on foreign policy, Davison asked the journalists to estimate the influence their editorials had on readers.  Although no evidence could be found to support their claims, Davison writes that a common response was, “The editorials have little effect on people like you and me, but the ordinary reader is likely to be influenced quite a lot.”&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

In both anecdotes, the parties that evaluated the impact of the communication estimated a larger media effect for others than on self.  These and other experiences led Davison to articulate what he called the third-person effect hypothesis, which predicts:

:“people will tend to overestimate the influence that mass communications have on the attitudes and behavior of others.  More specifically, individuals who are members of an audience that is exposed to a persuasive communication (whether or not this communication is intended to be persuasive) will expect the communication to have a greater effect on others than on themselves.  And whether or not these individuals are among the ostensible audience for the message, the impact that they expect this communication to have on others may lead them to take some action.  Any effect that the communication achieves may thus be due not to the reaction of the ostensible audience but rather to the behavior of those who anticipate, or think they perceive, some reaction on the part of others.” (p. 3).&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

In a case study conducted by Douglas McLeod et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=McLeodEvelandNathanson1997/&gt; the third-person effect was analyzed via participants’ perceptions of being influenced by violent or misogynistic lyrics from [[Hip hop music|rap music]]. The sample participants were divided up into three groups: one listened to violent rap music, another heard misogynistic rap music and the third group was the control. All lyrics heard were from actual, recorded songs. The study asked subjects to estimate the effects of listening to these types of lyrics on someone’s behaviors, knowledge and attitudes. They were also asked how these lyrics would affect themselves, students at their university, youth in New York or Los Angeles, and the average person. The study found that students found the rap lyrics to be least influential on themselves and more influential on youths in New York or Los Angeles. Simply put, people are more likely to assume everyone else is more easily influenced by messages than themselves. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Nikos Antonopoulos et al. (2015),&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"/&gt; found characteristics of what users observe when visiting a media [[website]] as well as a prediction model. The influence that this information has over their opinion verifies the existence of Web Third-person effect (WTPE). With the use of an online survey (N = 9150) in all media websites ([[radio station]], [[television station]], portal, [[newspaper]] and email-[[social media]]) it was proved that the variables that have a greater impact either on others or our friends than ourselves are: The number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], or other social networks. Moreover, age is a significant factor that explains the findings and is important to the effect. Additionally, factors that affect the influence of the user generated messages on others than on oneself were found. Furthermore, the more credible the news is perceived to be and when there is not a particular mediated message the WTPE is absent confirming the existing theory.

==Initial Support for the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis==

To support the third-person effect hypothesis, Davison (1983) conducted four minor and informal surveys.  Each survey asked between 25 and 35 participants to estimate the influence of persuasive communication on themselves and others.  Participants estimated self-other effects for (1) a campaign theme on gubernatorial vote choice, (2) television advertising on children, (3) the results of early presidential primaries on vote choice, and (4) campaign messages on presidential vote choice. On average they estimated (1) other New York voters were more influenced by campaign themes than they were personally, (2) other children were more influenced by television advertising than they had been personally, (3) others were more influenced by the results of early presidential primaries than they were personally, and (4) others were more influenced by campaign advertisements than they were personally. Although the surveys were informal, they support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

===Is Third-Person Perception a Methodological Artifact?===

Price and Tewksbury tested whether the third-person effect was a methodological artifact as a result of asking participants self-other questions in close proximity.  Using a three-condition experiment in which they asked participants in the first condition self-only questions, participants in the second condition other-only questions, and participants in the third condition self and other questions, Price and Tewksbury’s results indicate consistent estimates of self and other estimates across conditions.  These results, then, indicate the effect is not the result of a methodological artifact.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksbury1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=V.|author2=Tewksbury, D. |title=Measuring the third-person effect of news: The impact of question order, contrast and knowledge|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=120–141|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Factors Facilitate the Third-Person Effect==

According to Perloff (1999, 2009),&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perloff2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perloff|first1=R.M.|editor1-last=Bryant|editor1-first=Jennings|editor2-last=Oliver|editor2-first=Mary Beth|title=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135591106|pages=252–268|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BeOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252|language=en|chapter=Mass media, social perception, and the third-person effect}}&lt;/ref&gt; two major factors facilitate the third-person effect: judgments of message desirability and perceived social distance (social distance corollary). In their meta-analysis of studies of third-person perception Sun, Pan, and Shen (2008) found that message desirability is the most important moderator of third-person perception.&lt;ref name=SunPanShen2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Y.|author2=Pan, Z. |author3=Shen, L. |title=Understanding the third-person perception: Evidence from a meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2008|volume=58 | issue = 2|pages=280–300|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-person effects are particularly pronounced when the message is perceived as undesirable—that is, when people infer that “this message may not be so good for me” or “it’s not cool to admit you’re influenced by this media program.” In line with these predictions, people have been found to perceive content that is typically thought to be antisocial to have a larger impact on others than on themselves (e.g., [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]], pornography, antisocial rap music).&lt;ref name=Perloff2009 /&gt; Indeed, many researchers have found evidence that undesirable messages, such as violent and hateful messages, yield a greater third-person effect.&lt;ref name=AndsagerWhite2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Andsager|first=J.L.|last2=White|first2=H.A. |title=Self Versus Others: Media, Messages, and the Third-person Effect|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2007|ISBN=9780805857160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWkWQzQppZIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DuckMullin1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duck|first=J.M.|author2=Mullin, B.-A. |title=The perceived impact of the mass media: Reconsidering the third person effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=25 | issue = 1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420250107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuntherHwa1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HoorensRuiter1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoornes|first=V.|author2=Ruiter, S. |title=The optimal impact phenomenon: Beyond the third person effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=599–610|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;599::aid-ejsp773&gt;3.0.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when messages are perceived as desirable, people are not so likely to exhibit a third-person effect. According to Perloff (2009),&lt;ref name=Perloff2009 /&gt; the first-person effect, or reversed third-person effect, is more common for desirable messages&lt;ref name=CohenDavis1991 /&gt; and seems to emerge when agreement with the message reflects positively on the self and to some degree when the message touches on topics that are congruent with the orientation of groups with which individuals identify. According to the self-enhancement view, if the third-person effect is driven by a desire to preserve self-esteem, people should be willing to acknowledge effects for communications that are regarded as socially desirable, healthy, or otherwise good for the self.&lt;ref name=HoorensRuiter1996 /&gt; Undergraduates perceived that others will be more influenced than themselves by cigarette ads but they will be more affected by anti-tobacco and drunk-driving PSAs.&lt;ref name=Meirick2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meirick|first=P.C.|title=Rethinking the target corollary: The effects of social distance, perceived exposure, and perceived predispositions on first-person and third-person perceptions|journal=Communication Research|year=2005|volume=32|issue=6|pages=822–843|doi=10.1177/0093650205281059}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Another factor that influences the magnitude of the third-person effect is perceived social distance between self and comparison others. In the “[[social distance corollary]],” the disparity of self and other is increased as perceived distance between self and comparison others is increased.&lt;ref name=Meirick2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meirick2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meirick|first=P.C.|title=Topic-relevant reference groups and dimensions of distance: Political advertising and first-and third-person effects|journal=Communication Research|year=2004|volume=31|issue=2|pages=234–255|doi=10.1177/0093650203261514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although social distance is not a necessary condition for the third-person effect to occur, increasing the social distance makes the third-person effect larger. In their meta-analysis, Andsager and White (2007) concluded that “Research consistently finds that others who are anchored to self as a point of reference are perceived to be less influenced by persuasive messages than are others who are not defined and, therefore, not anchored to any point of reference at all” (p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;ref name=AndsagerWhite2007 /&gt;

==Psychological Underpinnings of the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis==

Perloff notes that the majority of third-person effect studies attribute the psychological underpinnings of the effect to either attribution theory or biased optimism.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perloff|first=R.M.|title=The third-person effect: A critical review and synthesis|journal=Media Psychology|year=1999|volume=1|issue=4|pages=353–378|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0104_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attribution theory]] predicts that actors tend to attribute their actions to situational factors while observers tend to attribute the same actions to dispositional factors.  For example, attribution theory predicts that a student who turns in a late assignment may explain to the professor that the tardiness is uncharacteristic and due to a situational factor like an unusual computer problem while the professor might believe the tardiness was due instead to a dispositional factor like the student’s laziness.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, then, attribution theory explains why a person may think that he or she understands the underlying persuasive aspects of the message while others’ dispositional flaws prevent them from perceiving those same aspects.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

Biased optimism predicts that people tend to judge themselves as less likely than others to experience negative consequences and, conversely, that people tend to judge themselves as more likely than others to experience positive events.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, biased optimism explains why people judge themselves as being less likely than others to be affected by persuasion.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

==Meta-Analytic Support for the Perceptual Component==

In a critical review and synthesis of the third-person effect hypothesis, Perloff (1999) noted that of the 45 published articles that had tested the phenomenon by 1999, all had found support for the perceptual component of the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

One year later, Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne conducted a meta-analysis of 32 empirical analyses that tested the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis.  Their results indicate the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis received robust support (''r'' = .50), especially compared to meta-analyses of other media effects theories.&lt;ref name=PaulSalwenDupagne2000 /&gt;

Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne (2000) also found three significant moderators of the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis: (1) sampling – samples obtained from nonrandom samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from random samples; (2) respondent – samples obtained from student samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from non-student samples; and (3) message – different types of content (e.g., general media messages, pornography, television violence, commercial advertisements, political content, nonpolitical news, etc.) have differing effects on the size of the obtained third-person perceptions.&lt;ref name=PaulSalwenDupagne2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=B.|author2=Salwen, M.B. |author3=Dupagne, M. |title=The third-person effect: A meta-analysis of the perceptual hypothesis|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=57–85|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0301_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for the Behavioral Component==

Multiple studies have found support for the behavioral component of the third-person effect hypothesis.  Possibly because Davison noted that censors seldom admit to have been adversely affected by the information they proscribe,&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;  scholars who have found support for the behavioral component have generally operationalized behavior as a willingness to censor content to stop the content from having the perceived negative persuasive impact on others.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

Specifically, scholars have demonstrated that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor pornography,&lt;ref name=Gunther1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|title=Overrating the X-rating: The third-person perception and support for censorship of pornography|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1995|volume=45|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1995.tb00712.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RojasShahFaber1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rojas|first=H.|author2=Shah, D.V. |author3=Faber, R.J. |title=For the good of others: Censorship and the third-person effect|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=163–186|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;   television violence,&lt;ref name=RojasShahFaber1996 /&gt;  sexual and violent television in Singapore,&lt;ref name=GuntherHwa1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Hwa, A.P. |title=Public perceptions of television influence and opinions about censorship in Singapore|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=3|pages=248–265|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.3.248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  cigarette, beer, liquor, and gambling advertising,&lt;ref name=ShahFaberYoun1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=D.V.|author2=Faber, R.J. |author3=Youn, S. |title=Susceptibility and severity: Perceptual dimensions underlying the third-person effect|journal=Communication Research|year=1999|volume=26|issue=2|pages=240–267|doi=10.1177/009365099026002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; rap music&lt;ref name=McLeodEvelandNathanson1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeod|first=D.M.|author2=Eveland, W.P. |author3=Nathanson, A.I. |title=Support for censorship of violent and misogynic rap lyrics: An analysis of the third-person effect|journal=Communication Research|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2|pages=153–174|doi=10.1177/009365097024002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks.&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"/&gt;

Scholars, however, have not found that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor news or political media content including censorship of press coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial,&lt;ref name=SalwenDriscoll1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen|first=M.B.|author2=Driscoll, P.D. |title=Consequences of third-person perception in support of press restrictions in the O.J.

==Extending the Hypothesis==

Scholars have noted that in some situations, people don’t always estimate greater media effects for others than for themselves.  Indeed, in certain situations people tend to estimate greater media effects on themselves than on others, and in other situations people tend to estimate similar media effects on self and others.  These two phenomena are commonly known as first person and second person effects respectively.

===First Person Effects===

====First Person Perception====

First person effects – the estimation of greater media effects on self than others – tends to happen in situations in which people judge it desirable to be influenced by the media message.  Innes and Zeitz first documented this phenomenon in 1988 when they noticed that participants exposed to content with a violent message exhibited traditional third-person effects while those exposed to a public service announcement exhibited the reverse.  They described this reverse effect, however, only as “something akin to a third person effect” (p.&amp;nbsp;461).&lt;ref name=InnesZeitz1988&gt;{{cite journal|last=Innes|first=J.M.|author2=Zeitz, H. |title=The public's view of the impact of the mass media: A test of the "third-person" effect.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=18|issue=5|pages=457–463|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420180507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, Cohen and Davis, who found that people tended to overestimate the effect of attack advertisements for disliked candidates on themselves than on others, coined the term “reverse third-person effect” (p.&amp;nbsp;687).&lt;ref name=CohenDavis1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J.|author2=Davis, R.G. |title=Third-person effects and the differential impact in negative political advertising|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1991|volume=68|issue=4|pages=680–688|doi=10.1177/107769909106800409}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The same year, Tiedge, Silverblatt, Havice, and Rosenfeld coined the term “first-person effect” to refer to the perceived effects of media on self as being more than on others.&lt;ref name=TiedgeEtAl1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiedge|first=J.T.|author2=Silverbaltt, A. |author3=Havice, M.J. |author4=Rosenfeld, R. |title=Discrepancy between perceived first person and perceived third-person mass media effects|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1991|volume=68|issue=1/2|pages=141–154|doi=10.1177/107769909106800115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Gunther &amp; Thorson, in a study that paved the way for extension of the third-person effect hypothesis, demonstrated empirically that the social desirability of the message tended to affect whether participants were likely to exhibit third- or first- person effects.  Socially desirable messages, Gunther and Thorson argue, tend to produce first-person effects while messages that are not perceived as desirable to be influenced by tend to produce traditional third-person effects.&lt;ref name=GuntherThorson1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Thorson, E. |title=Perceived persuasive effects of commercials and public service announcements: The third-person effect in new domains|journal=Communication Research|year=1992|volume=19|issue=5|pages=574–596|doi=10.1177/009365092019005002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Person Behavioral Effects====

Only a handful of studies have, intentionally or unintentionally, examined the behavioral component of the first-person effect.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksburyHuang1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuhDelormeReid2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huh|first=J.|author2=Delorme, D. |author3=Reid, L.N. |title=The third-person effect and its influence on behavioral outcomes in a product advertising context: The case of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising|journal=Communication Research|year=2004|volume=31|issue=5|pages=568–599|doi=10.1177/0093650204267934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkSalmon2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=H.S.|author2=Salmon, C.T. |title=A test of the third-person effect in public relations: Application of social comparison theory|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=2005|volume=82|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/107769900508200103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GolanBanning2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golan|first=G.J.|author2=Banning, S. |title=Exploring a link between the third-person effect and the theory of reasoned action: Beneficial ads and social expectations.|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=208–224|doi=10.1177/0002764208321352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Day2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=A.|title=Out of the living room and into the voting booth: An analysis of corporate public affairs advertising under the third person effect|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=243–260|doi=10.1177/0002764208321354}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Of these, only one has specifically examined a relationship between first-person perceptions and behavioral consequences.  Day examined the relationship between first-person effects from socially desirable issue advertisements and the likelihood of voting for legislation supporting the issue.  Day found a significant relationship between first-person perceptions of the advertisement and the reported likelihood of voting for the legislation.

A '''tondo''' (plural "tondi" or "tondos") is a [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] term for a [[Circle|circular]] work of art, either a [[painting]] or a [[sculpture]]. The word derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rotondo,'' "round."  The term is usually not used in English for small round paintings, but only those over about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (two feet) in diameter, thus excluding many round [[portrait miniature]]s – for sculpture the threshold is rather lower.

==History==
Artists have created tondi since [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The circular paintings in the centre of [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|painted vases]] of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. van der Grinten, ''On the Composition of the Medallions in the Interiors of Greek Black- and Red-Figured Kylixes''. Amsterdam 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The style was revived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy, where it may have developed from the smaller [[desco da parto]] or birthing tray.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been less common. In [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape.

The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. [[Andrea della Robbia]] and other members of his family created glazed terracotta ''tondi'' that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]], Florence, 1421–24,  Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the [[spandrel]]s of the arches.

In the sixteenth century the painterly style of ''istoriato'' decoration for [[maiolica]] wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also [[Charger (table setting)|charger]]).

The tondo has also been used as a design element in [[architecture]] since the [[Renaissance]]; it may serve centered in the gable-end of a [[pediment]] or under the round-headed [[arch]] that was revived in the fifteenth century.

Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from [[Champmol]]  (of a ''Pietá'' by [[Jean Malouel]] of 1400-15, now in the [[Louvre]]), the tondo became fashionable in 15th century [[Florence]], with [[Botticelli]] painting many examples, both [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and narrative scenes.  [[Michelangelo]] employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including ''The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist'', the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/michelangelo/holy_family.jpg.html|title=Michelangelo, The Doni Tondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Raphael]].

The infrequently-encountered synonym ''[[rondo]]''&lt;ref name="Artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/  Artlex.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; much more usually refers to a musical form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Art Rating''' is a reference book published since 1999 by [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] as one of the instruments of art market regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Чтобы как-то стабилизировать ценообразование на арт-рынке, Профессиональный союз художников с 1999 года издает "Единый художественный рейтинг". В него входят имена, даты жизни и рейтинговые категории почти 40 тыс. художников Российской империи, СССР, русского зарубежья, Российской Федерации и республик бывшего Советского Союза. Живые и ушедшие — вперемешку. "Делить художников по принципу "жив или мертв" неправильно: с точки зрения ценообразования смерть мастера не самый значительный фактор",— рассказывает Сергей Заграевский. Тем не менее высшую часть пирамиды рейтинга формируют великие мастера прошлого. Основание пирамиды — растущие молодые художники или инертная масса работников изобразительного цеха, которые не участвуют в бурной выставочной жизни. Эксперты, занимающиеся составлением рейтинга, отслеживают динамику роста или деградации тех и других. Живопись — это не теннис, и здесь, конечно, трудно быть уверенным, кто кого обыграет… И все же справочник во многом — зеркало ценообразования: середнячки редко бывают богаты". ([http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1028246 Ксения Гулиа. Картинная лотерея. Журнал «Деньги», № 37(692) от 22.09.2008])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Проект «Арт—рейтинг» может помочь «войти» и в современное искусство, и в сложный процесс арт—рынка. В Арт—рейтинге — в Едином художественном рейтинге Профессионального союза художников — сделана некая попытка классификации: расположить художников по уровню реализации их дарования с учетом, конечно, участия в престижных выставках, внимания к ним средств массовой информации, искусствоведов, музейных работников, членства в союзах, творческих объединениях и прочее... Подобная попытка поставить художников в ряд «по росту» может показаться безнадежной. Но она удалась. Поставленная задача решена, правда, без особых претензий на полную строгость и объективность, что и хорошо".([http://www.artcitiez.com/index.php?id=813 Журнал «Арт Город», № 1 (24), 2010])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Оценивая современную живопись, из-за отсутствия аукционов галеристы и покупатели руководствуются художественным рейтингом. Рейтинг в данном случае понимается как попытка со стороны экспертов стратифицировать творчество художников. Наиболее полным на сегодняшний день рейтингом как украинских, так и российских художников является «Единый художественный рейтинг»".

== About ==
United Art Rating (before 2012, referred to as United Artists Rating) is a rating published as a periodical reference book, registered as [[mass media]]. As of 2016, it has stood 22 printed editions, total number of printed copies is more than 90000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artunion.ru/rating/archive_engl.htm Archive of United Art Rating editions]&lt;/ref&gt; The electronic version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/electronic_engl.htm United Art Rating. The electronic version]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2016, United Art Rating included the names, dates of life and rating categories of 58965 artists (painters, graphic and poster artists, theatre decorators, batik painters, illustrators, animators, sculptors, jewelers, ceramists, authors of installations etc.).

Editor-in-chief: [[Sergey Zagraevsky]], chairman of Artists Trade Union of Russia, member of [[Russian Academy of Arts]] and Russian Academy of Art-critics, Honored culture worker of Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zagraevsky.com Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky. Official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, United Art Rating was awarded the gratitude of the Minister of culture of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/feedback.htm United Art Rating. Feedback (in Russian).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of rating ==
The Rating Centre acts under Artists Trade Union of Russia and has a status of an independent professional jury, free in its judges and estimations. Defining rating categories is made on the basis of all available information about works of art, biographies, expositions, collections and sales of works, catalogues and Internet and press publications, art historians' and art-managers' opinions, public opinion polls etc.

United Art Rating consists of 2 sections:
*Russian Art Rating (Rating of artists of Russian Empire, the USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of the former Soviet Union);
*International Artists Rating (All-world Rating of artists of 18th–21st centuries, forming the world art heritage).

Artists are subdivided into categories "A" and "B": an artist of "A" category does not virtually submit to the market's demand. an artist of "B" category is mainly oriented to the market demand.

Each category has its levels from the first (the top of recognition and fame; is referred to the deceased classic artists, whose works of art are widely recognized in museums) to the seventh one (amateur artist).

According to the declared principles, defining of rating categories is made on available information about expositions, sales and collections of works, catalogues, publications, biographies, public-opinion polls etc. Rating criteria are: art level of works, their humanistic significance, professionalism, exhibitions, works in museums, recognition by the public, galleries and art critics, social and civil significance of works, price level of works etc.

United Art Rating contains pricing recommendations about sale and purchase of works of art.

United Art Rating is constantly changed, refined and supplemented.

== Description of rating categories ==
*1 – an artist of world fame, tested with time (for no less than a century).
*1A – a world-famous artist.
*1B – a high-class professional artist with remarkable organizational skills, who is popular and in demand.
*2A – a high-class professional artist with a bright creative individuality.
*2B – a high-class professional artist, recognized and in demand with the art-market and public.
*3A – a professional artist with a recognizable individual style.
*3B – a professional artist, recognized and asked for in the art market and by the public.
*4A – an established professional artist with creative potential.
*4B – an established professional artist, who is in demand in the art market.
*5A – a formed professional artist with creative potential.
*5B – a formed professional artist.
*6A – a forming professional artist with creative potential.
*6B – a forming professional artist.
*7 – an amateur artist with perspective evaluation of specialists.
*8 – an amateur artist.
*9 – an artist-beginner.
*10 – an artist-apprentice.

== International Art Rating ==
International Art Rating includes the first three categories of United Art Rating (i.e. 1, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B). These artists formed and are forming the history of world art of 18th–21st centuries.

International Art Rating includes artists of [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and former Soviet republics, the republics of the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[United States]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Japan]] and some other countries, such as [[Namibia]].

All famous artists of the period mentioned in the project are represented such as [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Andy Warhol]] just to name a few. From [[Namibia]] e.g. the artists [[Adolph Jentsch]], [[Hans Anton Aschenborn]], [[Dieter Aschenborn]] and [[Uli Aschenborn]] are listed in the project (see '' 'Internet-project' '' under ''' 'External links' ''' below). The art of the rated artists form the world art heritage. 

Internet-project "Greatest world artists of XVIII–XXI centuries" is created on the base of International Art Rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://best.artunion.ru/best_engl.htm Internet-project "Greatest world artists of XVIII–XXI centuries"]&lt;/ref&gt; (about 11000 artists). Before 2014 the project was called "10000 best world artists of XVIII–XXI centuries".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30045">'''Universal grammar''' ('''UG''') in [[linguistics]], is the theory of the [[genetics|genetic]] component of the [[language faculty]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [[Grammar|structural rules]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|innate]] to humans, independent of [[sensory experience]]. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of [[psychological development]], children then adopt specific [[syntactic rule]]s that conform to UG.&lt;ref name="toolmodule2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar|author=Noam Chomsky|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. [[Prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]], [[Descriptive grammar|descriptive]] and [[Pedagogical grammar|pedagogical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=1-4050-7063-3|page=92|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v382j|title=First Words: How do children develop language?|date=16 December 2014|work=BBC Radio 4|department=Word of Mouth|last1=Szendroi|first1=Kriszta|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on [[Poverty of the stimulus|the poverty of the stimulus]] (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural [[human languages]]. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |last2=Levinson |first2=Stephen C. |title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=26 October 2009 |volume=32 |issue=05 |pages=429-48 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X |pmid=19857320 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-myth-of-language-universals%3A-language-diversity-Evans-Levinson/1202032fc27b5da12362d82d48eed5e1c34c166f |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727171702/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f31/330319b363499ec974b27b7678d96025cde9.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.

== Argument ==
The theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme [[sensory deprivation]]), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing [[noun]]s from [[verb]]s, or distinguishing [[function word]]s from [[content word]]s). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.

As Chomsky puts it, "Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2007 |chapter=Approaching UG from Below |title=Interfaces + Recursion = Language? Chomsky's Minimalism and the View from Syntax-Semantics |series=Studies in Generative Grammar |editor=Hans-Martin Gärtner |editor2=Uli Sauerland |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-018872-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).

In the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: "How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).

Chomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term "UG" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:

"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is
appropriated from other systems."

In other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).

Some students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called [[linguistic universal]]s, often in the form of "If X holds true, then Y occurs." These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.

Later linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and [[Richard Montague]], developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the [[argument from poverty of the stimulus]] to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist [[Lydia White]].

Syntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being "hard-wired" (Chomsky's [[principles and parameters]] approach), a [[logical consequence]] of a specific syntactic architecture (the [[GPSG|generalized phrase structure]] approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the [[systemic functional linguistics|functionalist]] approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark C.

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article titled, "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hauser | first = Marc | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = Noam | author2-link = Noam Chomsky | last3 = Fitch | first3 = William Tecumseh | author3-link = W. Tecumseh Fitch | title = The Faculty of Language:  What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 1569–1579 | date = 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | issue = 5598 | access-date = 28 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.
This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== History ==
The idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to [[Roger Bacon]]'s observations in his {{circa|lk=no|1245}} ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' and {{circa|lk=no|1268}} ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek Grammar]]'' that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century [[speculative grammar]]ians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for [[philosophical language]]s. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], [[Hugh Blair]], [[James Burnett]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], and [[Adam Smith]]. The article on grammar in the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) contains an extensive section titled "Of Universal Grammar".

The idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the "[[linguistics wars]]".

During the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a [[behaviourist]] perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success.&lt;ref name=toolmodule&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said.  For example, when a child says "milk" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;Ambridge &amp; Lieven, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chomsky's theory ==

{{further|Language acquisition device|Generative grammar|X-bar theory|Government and binding|Principles and parameters|Minimalist program}}
Chomsky argued that the [[human brain]] contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

Speakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this [[poverty of stimulus]] means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/sasspdf/whatexactlyisUG.pdf|title=What exactly is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?|last=Northumbria University|first=Ewa Dąbrowska|date=|website=www.northumbria.ac.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like ''what'' cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:

: *"What did John meet a man who sold?"

Such expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of [[creole language]]s is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] controversial [[language bioprogram theory]]. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a [[pidgin]]. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a [[Creole language|creole]]. Unlike pidgins, creoles have [[native speaker]]s (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], they uniformly express [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. [[Negative concord]] occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson Kam | first1 = C.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of [[relexification]], which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticisms ==
[[Geoffrey Sampson]] maintains that universal grammar theories are not [[falsifiable]] and are therefore [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. He argues that the grammatical "rules" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate: Revised Edition |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-7385-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffrey Elman]] argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, "worst-case" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an [[explanandum]] looking for theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R. Hurford |chapter=Nativist and Functional Explanations in Language Acquisition |editor=I. M. Roca |title=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition |publisher=Foris Publications |location=Dordrecht, Holland and Providence, Rhode Island |year=1995 |page=88 |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/rocapaper.pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morten H. Christiansen]] and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, "apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Morten H 2008"&gt;Christiansen, Morten H. and [[Chater, Nick]]. "Language as Shaped by the Brain". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 31.5 (2008): 489–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation and is indeed unnecessary.
* Universal grammar is in conflict with biology: it cannot have evolved by standardly accepted [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] evolutionary principles.
* There are no linguistic universals: universal grammar is refuted by abundant variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.&lt;ref name="Hinzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinzen |first=Wolfram |title=The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar |journal=Language Sciences |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 2012 |pages=635–649 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see [[Distributional hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Scott |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael |year=2001 |title=Testing the distributional hypothesis: The influence of context on judgements of semantic similarity |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |pages=611–616 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.7535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker "ed" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like ''goed'' and ''eated'' and correct these errors over time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández |first=Eva M. |author2=Helen Smith Cairns |title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England:  |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ ''similarity-based generalization'' strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.&lt;ref name="Yarlett"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarlett |first=Daniel G. |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael J. A. |year=2008 |title=Language Learning Through Similarity-Based Generalization|accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.393.7298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language acquisition]] researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit [[negative feedback]] that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like ''goed'' to ''went'' through repetitive failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramscar |first=Michael |last2=Yarlett |first2=Daniel |year=2007 |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: A new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–960 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |pmid=21635323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of [[fast mapping]], as many nativists assume.

In the domain of field research, the [[Pirahã language]] is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by [[Daniel Everett]]. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for [[recursion]], including [[Dependent clause|embedded clauses]], as well as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] and [[colour]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=August–October 2005 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |title=How Do You Say 'Disagreement' in Pirahã? |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/books/a-new-book-and-film-about-rare-amazonian-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page=C1 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, et al., 2007 Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment [http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063250/http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive
structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 2012 |first=Steven T. |last=Piantadosi |first2=Laura |last2=Stearns |first3=Daniel L. |last3=Everett |first4=Edward |last4=Gibson |title=A corpus analysis of Pirahã grammar: An investigation of recursion |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Piantadosi_et_al_2012_LSAtalk_Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCrum |first=Robert |title=Daniel Everett: 'There is no such thing as universal grammar |work=The Observer |date=March 24, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/25/daniel-everett-human-language-piraha |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasello]], a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=Origins of human communication |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51520-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

'''Women in the workforce''' earning wages or  salary are part of a modern phenomenon, one that developed at the same time as the growth of paid employment for men, but women have been challenged by [[Gender inequality|inequality]] in the workforce. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation in the [[workforce]]. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor [[socio-economic status]] of women, have had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become [[professionalization|professionalized]] over the 19th and 20th centuries.

Women's lack of access to [[higher education]] had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like [[law]] and [[medicine]] was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, [[Cambridge University]] only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107063131/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html|date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term [[career]]s rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs.

The increasing rates of women contributing in the work force has led to a more equal disbursement of [[working hours|hours worked]] across the regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2007$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rdCufG2vozTpKw7TBGbyoWw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=26;dataMax=56$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=|title=Graph|publisher=[[Gapminder World]] |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in western European countries the nature of women's employment participation remains markedly different from that of men.

Although access to paying occupations (the "workforce") has been and remains unequal in many occupations and places around the world, scholars sometimes distinguish between "work" and "paying work", including in their analysis a broader spectrum of labor such as uncompensated [[household work]], childcare, [[eldercare]], and family [[subsistence farming]].

As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] raged in the U.S., [[Virginia Penny]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] was finishing up her research project and publish the ground-breaking book, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-women-can-make-money-married-or-single-in-all-branches-of-the-arts-and-sciences-professions-trades-agricultural-and-mechanical-pursuits/oclc/15690614 ''How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits'' (Philadelphia, 1862)]. Hoping to offer hard facts about what women in the workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person – when she would also interview workers. Much of her site visits were conducted in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to women as well as the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for wage differentials based on gender. She dedicated her book "to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood," and the book garnered much attention by reviewers and scholars across the country.

In the twentieth century, [[division of labor]] by [[gender]] has been studied most systematically in [[women's studies]] (especially [[women's history]], which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and [[gender studies]] more broadly. Occupational studies, such as the [[history of medicine]] or studies of [[professionalization]], also examine questions of gender, and the roles of women in the history of particular fields. Women dominate as accountants, auditors, and psychologists.&lt;ref name="Witz-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anne Witz | title = Patriarchy and Professions: The Gendered Politics of Occupational Closure | journal = Sociology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | date = 1990 | pages = 675–690 | url = http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/4/675 | doi = 10.1177/0038038590024004007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanagh-2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=S.

In addition, modern [[civil right]]s law has frequently examined gender restrictions of access to a field of occupation; [[gender discrimination]] within a field; and gender harassment in particular workplaces. This body of law is called [[employment discrimination|employment discrimination law]], and gender and race discrimination are the largest sub-sections within the area. Laws specifically aimed at preventing discrimination against women have been passed in many countries; see, e.g., the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] in the United States.

==Paid employment globally==
[[File:Changes in percentages of professionals by gender.png|thumbnail|This chart depicts the change in the percentage of women in three professional occupations (dentist, physician, lawyer), from 1970 to 2007.]]
Women still contribute to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid non-agricultural jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main forms of paid employment for women worldwide is actually a traditional one, that of the market "hawker". Women have worked outside the home as vendors at markets since ancient times in many parts of the world, such as Central America, South Asia, and Africa.

During the 20th century, the most significant global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel and the development of a large migrant workforce of women [[domestic workers]] seeking jobs outside of their native country. The [[Philippines]] is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos working outside the Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|title=Overseas deployment of Filipino domestic workers continues to rise|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|publisher=Inquirer Global Nation|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/32067/overseas-deployment-of-filipino-domestic-workers-continues-to-rise|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of Filipino women working overseas are in the millions. Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"/&gt; Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines to be cared for by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several countries in the Middle East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that [[remittances]] from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An atlas of migration|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation by sector===
[[File:Computer industry entrepreneur workshop.jpg|thumb|Attendees at a computer business networking event for potential entrepreneurs, United State.]]
[[File:Woodstock press photographer.jpg|thumb|A woman press photographer covers a music fest, Poland, 2008.]]

Women and men often participate in economic sectors in sharply different proportions, a result of gender clustering in occupations. Reasons for this may include a traditional association of certain types of work with a particular gender. There is a wide range of other possible economic, social and cultural variables that impact the gender distribution in different occupations, including within a region or country. An averaging of statistics gathered by the United Nations for 2004 through 2007 reflects these differences (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding):

'''Sectoral distribution of employed persons, by sector and sex (2004 through 2007)'''&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Women 2010|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW_full%20report_color.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 15, 2012|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Region'''||'''Agriculture'''||'''Industry'''||'''Services'''
|-
|Africa||43% women / 42% men||11% women / 20% men||46% women / 39% men 
|-
|Asia (excluding China)||32% women / 26% men||12% women / 25% men||56% women / 49% men 
|-
|Latin America and the Caribbean||7% women / 22% men||13% women / 27% men||80% women / 51% men 
|-
|Europe and other more developed regions||6% women / 8% men||15% women / 36% men||79% women / 55% men 
|}

More detailed statistics show large differences even within these regions. For example, 11% of employed women in East Asia are employed in agriculture, a number that rises to 55% in South Asia; 70% of women in Southern Africa are employed in the service sector, while in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa this number is 26%.&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"/&gt;

===Occupational dissimilarity index===
Choice of occupation is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to the male-female wage differential. In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from direct wage discrimination within occupations, as males in the female dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the male dominated occupations usually make higher than average wages. The occupational [[index of dissimilarity|dissimilarity index]] is a measure from 0 to 100; it measures the percent of laborers that would need to be rearranged into a job typically done by the opposite sex in order for the wage differential to disappear. In 1960, the dissimilarity index for the United States was measured at 62. It has dropped since then, but at 47 in 2000, is still one of the highest of any developed nation.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hong Li J | year = | title = Gender Differences in Class Mobility: A Comparative Study of the United States, Sweden, and West Germany | url = | journal = Acta Sociologica | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 315–333 | doi=10.1177/000169939804100402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations formed by women for rights==
In the nineteenth century women became involved in organizations dedicated to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Visions of America A History of the United States, books a La Carte Edition. Pearson College Div, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 The National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women. In 1920 The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was formed to create equal rights and a safe workplace for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline2.html#ixzz3Vlm8PLZb Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.: Timeline of Events (1921-1979).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 a group called Financial Women's Association (FWA), was formed. It is an organization established by a group of Wall Street women. The goal was: to advance professionalism in finance and in the financial services industry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women's achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices&gt;[http://www.diversitybestpractices.com/news-articles/20-womens-organizations-you-need-know "20 Women's Organizations You Need to Know"], Diversity Best Practices, February 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Nancy. "The American Women's Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with Documents."

Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE's mission: the advancement of women in the workplace.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices /&gt; Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace.

==Laws protecting women's rights as workers==

International laws protecting women's rights as workers exist through the efforts of various international bodies.  On June 16, 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) passed C189 [[Convention on Domestic Workers|Domestic Workers Convention, 2011]], binding signatories to regulations intended to end abuses of migrant domestic workers. It was anticipated that the Convention would put pressure on non-ratifying countries to support changes to their own laws to meet the change in international standards protecting domestic workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Switzerland – A step forward for domestic workers|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/world/europe/17briefs-Switzerland.html?gwh=9875484B408842FDAE59E701E668F0EF|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law preventing domestic workers from having residency rights granted to other foreign workers, a move that affected an estimated 100,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeParle|first=Jason|title=Domestic workers convention may be landmark|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/domestic-workers-convention-may-be-landmark.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO has previously ratified the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]] in 1951, which came into force in 1953, the [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]], which went into force in 1960 and the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]], which went into force in 2002. In 1966, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which went into force in 1976. [[UNESCO]] also adopted the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] in 1960, which came into force in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, went into force in 2003. The [[Home Work Convention]], adopted by the ILO, went into force in 2000;the Convention protects the rights of persons doing paid work out of their home, which is frequently women workers. It offers equal protection regarding working conditions, safety, remuneration, social security protection, access to training, minimum age of employment, and maternity protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking]] often targets young women who are abducted and sent outside their own country to work as domestic workers, often in conditions of extreme exploitation. A number of international laws have been ratified to address human trafficking of women and children.

Maternity protection measures are put in place to insure that women will not be discriminated against in the workplace once they return from having a child. They should also not be exposed to any health hazards while they are pregnant and at work. They are allowed time off for maternity leave as well, which allows them to bond with their child; this aspect of development is crucial for infants to gain proper attachment skills. Employers are expected to hold to these policies. Yet many women on maternity leave receive very small amounts of time off to allow for their health along with their babies' health. The amount of time allowed for maternity leave as well as the pay for maternity leave varies by country, with Sweden having the longest amount off with 68 weeks and the United States being one of the worst, with the typical period being 12 weeks without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, S.

==Women in workforce leadership==
[[File:Deli womens entre network.jpg|thumb|An information technology networking social for potential entrepreneurs. New Delhi, India]]

Female decision-makers from around Europe are organized in several national and European wide networks. The networks aim to promote women in decision-making positions in politics and the economy across Europe. These networks were founded in the 1980s and are often very different from the "service clubs" founded in the early days of the century, like Soroptimist and Zontas.

"Women in Management" is about women in business in usually male-dominated areas. Their motivation, their ideas and leadership styles and their ability to enter into leadership positions is the subject of most of the different networks.

As of 2009, women represented 20.9% of parliament in Europe (both houses) and 18.4% world average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm|publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union|title=Women in National Parliaments|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, 90 women serve in the U.S. Congress: 18 women serve in the Senate, and 73 women serve in the House Women hold about three percent of executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|title=Facts on Women Officeholders, Candidates and Voters|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, men still represent 9 out of 10 board members in European blue-chip companies, The discrepancy is widest at the very top: only 3% of these companies have a woman presiding over the highest decision-making body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

List of members of the [[European Network of Women in Decision-making in Politics and the Economy]]:

*Committee of Women Elected Representatives of Local and Regional Authorities (Council of European Municipalities and Regions)
*BPW Europe, Business and Professional Women – Europe
*[[Association of Organisations of Mediterranean Businesswomen]]
*[[Eurochambres]] Women's Network
*[[European Platform of Women Scientists]]
*Network of Parliamentary Committees for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union
*[[European Network to Promote Women's Entrepreneurship]]

*[[European Women's Management Development International Network]], EWMD
*[[Femanet – Eurocadres]]
*[[European Professional Women's Network]], EPWN
*[[Women's Forum for the Economy and the Society]]

The European Union Commission has created a platform for all these networks. It also funded the [[Women to the Top]] program in 2003–2005 to bring more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have been created to promote the presence of women in top responsibilities, in politics and business. One example is EWMD European Women's Management Development (cited above), a European and international network of individual and corporate members, drawn from professional organisations. Members are from all areas of business, education, politics and culture.

Women who are born into the upper class rather than the middle or lower class have a much better chance at holding higher positions of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in the work force if they choose to enter it.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} According to a study published 2015, of the women who held C-suite jobs in the U.S., 94% played [[competitive sports]], 52% at a university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ey.com/gl/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-sport-is-a-critical-lever-in-advancing-women-at-all-levels-according-to-new-ey-espnw-report|title=Sport is a critical lever in advancing women at all levels, according to new EY/espnW report|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to equal participation==
As [[gender role]]s have followed the formation of agricultural and then industrial societies, newly developed [[profession]]s and fields of occupation have been frequently inflected by gender. Some of the ways in which gender affects a field include:

*Prohibitions or restrictions on members of a particular gender entering a field or studying a field
*[[Discrimination]] within a field, including wage, management, and prestige hierarchies
*Expectation that mothers, rather than fathers, should be the primary childcare providers

Note that these gender restrictions may not be universal in time and place, and that they operate to restrict both men and women. However, in practice, norms and laws have historically restricted women's access to particular occupations;civil rights laws and cases have thus primarily focused on equal access to and participation by ''women'' in the workforce. These barriers may also be manifested in hidden bias and by means of many [[microinequities]].

Many women face issues with sexual abuse while working in agriculture fields as well. Many of the women who work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because the fact that they are documented will be brought up and may be deported.

===Access to education and training===
[[File:Maasai women at USAID literacy event (6595762621).jpg|thumb|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] women at [[USAID]] literacy event]]
A number of occupations became "[[professionalization|professionalized]]" through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining regulatory bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular [[higher education]]al requirements. As women's access to higher education was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to [[Cambridge University]] until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html "Fact Sheet: Women at Cambridge"].&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but access to higher education remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where access to higher education is formally available, women's access to the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where access to primary education is limited through social custom.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007"&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to capital===
[[File:Women's business conference bahia brazil.jpg|thumb|Governor of Bahia, Brazil, attending the first state women's business conference]]
Women's access to occupations requiring capital outlays is also hindered by their unequal access (statistically) to capital;this affects occupations such as entrepreneur and small business owner, farm ownership, and investor.&lt;ref&gt;"DEVELOPMENT: Gender Equality Equals Growth", ''World News'', June 2, 2004, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040208105312/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/may00/23_11_078.html archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous [[microloan]] programs attempt to redress this imbalance, targeting women for loans or grants to establish start-up businesses or farms, having determined that aid targeted to women can disproportionately benefit a nation's economy.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004"&gt;United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) statistics. See Erwin Northoff, "FOOD: Women Farmers are Invisible Actors in Hunger Drama", ''World News'', 2004 February 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  While research has shown that women cultivate more than half the world's food — in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women are responsible for up to 80% of food production — most such work is family subsistence labor, and often the family property is legally owned by the men in the family.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004" /&gt;

===Discrimination within occupations===
[[File:SHG women running a cabinet manufacturing business (5103677355).jpg|thumb|Women operating a cabinet manufacturing business, India]]
{{See also|Gender pay gap|Glass ceiling|Sexual harassment}}
The idea that men and women are naturally suited for different occupations is known as horizontal segregation.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;Massey, D. S. Categorically Unequal. New York: Russel Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company for a long period of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, E.F. Opting out and opting in: understanding the complexities of women's career transitions. Career Development International. 12, 218 – 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to earn less money than men, despite establishing equal pay laws.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]'', p.&amp;nbsp;41 (Figure 3.3 "Estimated earnings for women are substantially lower than for men");p.&amp;nbsp;36 (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the textbook ''Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology'', women are at a higher risk of financial disadvantage in modern-day society than men. Statistical findings suggest that  women are under paid for similar jobs men complete despite having the same qualifications. The statistical data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor suggests that women are discriminated against in the workforce based on gender. The textbook reads, “Women’s wages are also more volatile than men’s wages, and women face a much higher risk of seeing large drops in income than do men” (Kennedy 2008). Anderson clearly demonstrates a significant difference between men and women in the workforce in regards to pay. Women are left more exposed to financial devastation and unemployment. The textbook also mentions that women are often give public positions versus private or leadership positions despite having appropriate work experience, higher education, or necessary skills to qualify. According to the Joint Economic Committee, “Among women heading families, the unemployment rate has grown and is higher than the national unemployment rate and twice as high as that for either married men or married women” (Joint Economic Committee, 2009). In other words, unmarried women who are the head of household are more vulnerable to financial disadvantage than married men or women. The unemployment rate of women compared to men suggests that single women are discriminated against based on gender. Anderson writes, “All women are disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure crisis, since women are 32% more likely than men to have subprime mortgages (One-third of women, compared to one-fourth of men, have subprime mortgages; and, the disparity between women and men increases in higher income brackets)” (Anderson 265). The statistical information illustrates the dramatic difference between men and women in regards to finances. It can be inferred that men are favored in the workforce over women. Women are discriminated against based on their gender and thus are more likely to struggle financially because of discriminatory employers.

===Actions and inactions of women themselves===
Through a process known as "employee clustering", employees tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. Some women are content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is.

Furthermore, women as a whole tend to be less assertive and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so.&lt;ref name="women's media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmedia.com|title=Index of /|publisher=Womensmedia.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys are more likely to be pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Spade, Joan Z. "Gender and Education in the US." Gender Mosaics: Social Perspectives. Ed. Dana VannoyOxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue that contributes to income inequality by gender is that women are much more likely than men to take "breaks" in their careers to have children, often remaining out of the workforce for extended periods of time, while men in the same role or occupation (or other women who do not leave the workforce) most likely are continuing to earn promotions and/or merit-based salary increases. When a woman in this scenario re-enters the workforce, she may be offered a smaller salary or a lower position than she might have merited had she remained in the workforce alongside her colleagues (both male and female) who have not interrupted their careers.

In the last 50 years there have been great changes toward gender equality in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the [[feminist movement]] of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right back out of the labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the [[baby boomer]]s. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.

===Effects on the middle and upper classes===
The addition of women into the workforce was one of the key factors that has increased [[social mobility]] over the last 50 years, although this has stalled in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of [[birth control]], these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five states{{clarification needed|date=December 2018|reason=United States?}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} recorded 53 percent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 percent of women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, and 32 percent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women.

In comparison with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women, and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high, but this does not necessarily ensure a level playing field. For example, Microsoft (US) was sued because of the conduct of one of its supervisors over e-mail. The supervisor allegedly made sexually offensive comments via e-mail, such as referring to himself as "president of the amateur gynecology club." He also allegedly referred to the plaintiff as the "Spandex Queen. E-harassment is not the sole form of harassment. In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as "bimbos" and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India, HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, it has been suggested that there are fewer women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, ''Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do'', author [[Aparna Jain]] interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/towards-fostering-a-gender-neutral-workplace/story-32TrlU2iOhQfWGGWStcSYL.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/living/book-review-aparna-jains-own-it-brings-out-of-unarticulated-darkness-the-indescribable-things-that-happen-to-women-at-the-workplace-2614092.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]]' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna .&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/sexual-harassment-case-against-ihcl-boss-rakesh-sarna-may-have-added-to-cyrus-mistry-woes/articleshow/55361051.cms&lt;/ref&gt; A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] scandal at [[The Energy and Resources Institute]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/hostile-climate-rk-pachauri-reign-teri&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector.

Recognizing the invisible nature of power structures that marginalize women at the workplace, the Supreme Court in the landmark case ''Vaishaka versus High Court of Rajasthan'' (1997) identified sexual harassment as violative of the women's right to equality in the workplace and enlarged the ambit of its definition. The judgment equates a [[hostile work environment]] on the same plane as a direct request for sexual favors. To quote: "Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: physical contact and advances; a demand or request for sexual favours; sexually coloured remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature". The judgement mandates appropriate work conditions should be provided for work, leisure, health, and hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at the workplace and no woman employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in connection with her employment.

This law thus squarely shifts the onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies are yet to enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, "I have a few IT clients. When I point to the need for a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.

Not surprisingly many cases go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company policy is the first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing "woman's purity," the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and there is no guarantee that the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement."

===Effects on the working class===
Women in lower wage jobs are more likely to be subject to wage discrimination. They are more likely to bring home far less than their male counterparts with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.&lt;ref&gt;Edin, K. and Kefalas, M. (2005). ''Promises I Can Keep: Why poor women put motherhood before marriage. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in the history of this country,{{which|date=January 2014}} there were distinctive socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

==Impact issues of female participation in the workforce==
A 2008 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that women were 46% more likely to call in sick for short time periods than men and a third more likely than men to take short term sick leave.  At 60 days or more, men and women were equal in terms of sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science Daily]]'', "[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212846.htm Women Take Almost 50 Percent More Short-term Sick Leave Than Men]", ''[[BMJ]]'', 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women in the workforce have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers to be able to take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scharlach A. E. |author2=Grosswald B. | year = 1997 | title = The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 | url = | journal = Social Service Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 335–359 | doi=10.1086/604261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility===
Increased participation of women in the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]] effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well.&lt;ref name=bloom2007&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Bloom |first2=David |last2=Canning |first3=Günther |last3=Fink |first4=Jocelyn |last4=Finlay |year=2009 |title=Fertility, female labor force participation, and the demographic dividend |journal=[[Journal of Economic Growth]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1007/s10887-009-9039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[United Nation]]s data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/RevisedLIMpaper.PDF|title=Female Labour-Force Participation|author=Lin Lean Lim|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}, part of {{cite book|title=Completing the Fertility Transition|year=2009|publisher=[[United Nations]] Publications|isbn=9789211513707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] area, increased female labor participation has been associated with an increased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries|author1=Namkee Ahn  |author2=Pedro Mira |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=15|issue=4|year=2002|pages=667–682|jstor=20007839 |doi=10.1007/s001480100078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causality analyses indicate that fertility rate influences female labor participation and not as much the other way around.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;

Regarding types of jobs, women who work in nurturing professions such as teaching and health generally have children at an earlier age.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt; It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable [[work–life balance]] in order to combine motherhood and employment.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C.

==History==

===19th century===
Women have worked at agricultural tasks since ancient times, and continue to do so around the world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries changed the nature of work in Europe and other countries of the Western world. Working for a [[wage]], and eventually a [[salary]], became part of urban life. Initially, women were to be found doing even the hardest physical labor, including working as "hurriers" hauling heavy coal carts through mine shafts in Great Britain, a job that also employed many children. This ended after government intervention and the passing of the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], an early attempt at regulating the workplace.

During the 19th century, an increasing number of women in Western countries took jobs in factories, such as textile mills, or on assembly lines for machinery or other goods. Women also worked as "[[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s" of produce, flowers, and other market goods, and bred small animals in the working-class areas of [[London]]. [[Piecework]], which involved needlework (weaving, embroidery, winding wool or silk) that paid by the piece completed, was the most common employment for women in 19th century Great Britain. It was poorly paid, and involved long hours, up to 14 hours per day to earn enough wages to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class women were usually involved in some form of paid employment, as it provided some insurance against the possibility that their husband might become too ill or injured to support the family. During the era before [[workers' compensation]] for disability or illness, the loss of a husband's wages could result in the entire family being sent to a Victorian [[workhouse]] to pay debts.

Inequality in wages was to be expected for women. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d. Employers stated they preferred to hire women, because they could be "more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1870 US Census]] was the first United States Census to count "females engaged in each occupation" and provides an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in [[sweatshop]]s. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but [[teaching]] and the occupations of [[dressmaking]], [[Hatmaking|millinery]], and [[tailoring]] played a larger role. Two-thirds of [[teacher]]s were women. Women could also be found in such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), and hunter and trapper (2).

===20th century===
[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|right|upright "[[We Can Do It!]]" by [[J. Howard Miller]].|In the United States, the "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" image, as it has become known, is an iconic representation of the US government's efforts to exhort women to work during World War II, and has been adapted numerous times to represent working women or, more broadly, women overcoming adversity and other [[proto-feminist]] messages.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such.&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10"&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p.10. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1972,&lt;/ref&gt; Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p. 9. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the turn of the 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. H: "Life in the Age of Enterprise", pp. 120-121. Capricorn Books, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[World War I]] made space for women in the workforce, among other economical and social influences. Due to the rise in demand for production from Europe during the raging war, more women found themselves working outside the home.

In the first quarter of the century, women mostly occupied jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, "lace-collar" jobs.&lt;ref name="Green-57"&gt;Green, E: "The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915–1945", pp. 57-58. HarperCollins, 1992,&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1920, [[The New York Times]] ran a head line that read: "the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation"&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10" /&gt; which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce.

[[World War II]] created millions of jobs for women. Thousands of American women actually joined the military:
140,000 in the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)]] WAC;
100,000 in the Navy (WAVE);
23,000 in the Marines;
14,000 in the [[Navy Nurse Corps]] and,
13,000 in the Coast Guard.
Although almost none saw combat, they replaced men in noncombat positions and got the same pay as the men would have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force.&lt;ref name="Green-57"/&gt; Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been.&lt;ref name=Moody1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Moody|title=An injury to all : the decline of American Unionism|year=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London|page=22|isbn=0860919293|quote=The rate of participation of women in the labor force rose from about 28% in 1940 to 37% in 1945 and then fell to 30% in 1947.

Newspapers and magazines directed at women encouraged them to keep a tidy home while their husbands were away at work. These articles presented the home as a woman's proper domain, which she was expected to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/05/22/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday May 22, 1949|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era|last=May|first=Elaine Tyler|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=10–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, jobs were still available to women.

===The Quiet Revolution===

The increase of women in the labor force of Western countries gained momentum in the late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity.

The first phase encompasses the time between the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era gave birth to the "independent female worker." From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of [[marriage bars]], which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.

In the third phase, labeled the "roots of the revolution" encompassing the time from 1950– mid-to-late 1970s, the movement began to approach the warning signs of a revolution. Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a "career". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in "pink-collar jobs" as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. The [[sexual harassment]] experienced by these [[Pink-collar worker|pink collar]] workers is depicted in the film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]''. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse—the so-called "M.R.S. degree". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly.

The fourth phase, known as the "Quiet Revolution", began in the late 1970s and continues on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like [[women in medicine|medicine]], law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations that only worked intermittently due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning in the 1970s;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step into and out of the labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying later in life{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women's labor force participation more than offset the decline for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2003/wp2003-22.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|title=''Do Women’s and Men’s Labor Market Outcomes Differentially Affect Real Wage Growth and Inflation?''|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for this big jump in the 1970s has been attributed by some scholars to widespread access to the [[birth control pill]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} While "the pill" was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'', 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the [[age of majority]] had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely as a consequence of the [[Vietnam War]]; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a "big bang" revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldin, Claudia | title = The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education and Family | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 96 | issue = 2 | date = 2006 | pages = 1–21 | doi=10.1257/000282806777212350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupational safety and health ==
Women tend to have different occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[tendonitis]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress may be due to the fact that women are often [[caregiver]]s at home and do [[contingent work]] and [[contract work]] at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is [[homicide]], which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/#2|title = Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work|date = June 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women are at lower risk for work-related death than men. However, [[personal protective equipment]] is usually designed for typical male proportions, which can create hazards for women who have ill-fitting equipment.&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; Women are less likely to report an occupational injury than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research is ongoing into occupational hazards that may be specific to women. Of particular interest are potential [[Toxic substance|environmental causes]] of [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] is an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[insomnia]], and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation. Women are also at higher risk for [[occupational stress]], which can be caused by balancing roles as a parent or caregiver with work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
