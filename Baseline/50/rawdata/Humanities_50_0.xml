'''''An Area of Darkness''''' is a book written by [[V. S. Naipaul]] in 1964. It is a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] detailing Naipaul's trip through India in the early sixties. It was the first of Naipaul's acclaimed Indian trilogy which includes ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' and ''[[India: A Million Mutinies Now]]''.  The narration is anecdotal and descriptive.

A deeply pessimistic work, ''An Area of Darkness'' conveys the acute sense of disillusionment which the author experiences on his first visit to his ancestral land. The book was immediately banned in India for its "negative portrayal of India and its people".&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/you-cant-read-this-book/article2953626.ece | title=You can't read this book | work=[[The Hindu]] | accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeocryptography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀρχαῖος}}, ''arkhaios'', "ancient" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:κρυπτός|κρυπτός]]}} (''kruptós''), "hidden, secret"; and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:γράφω#Ancient Greek|γράφειν]]}} (''graphein''), "to write") is the [[Research|study]] of decoding a monument or structure by determining the underlying mathematical order beneath the proportions, size, and placement to find any re-occurring or unusual data in respect to that which is being studied,&lt;ref name=Munck&gt;{{cite web|last=Munck|first=Carl|title=The Spirit of Ma'at|url=http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/nov2/munck.htm|publisher=Spirit of Maat|access-date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within another monument or structure.

Archaeocryptography is not a recognized branch of [[archaeology]] or of any other academic discipline. It is an example of [[pseudoscience]] or [[pseudoarchaeology]] that employs contrived calculations involving many free parameters to achieve an impressive-looking result.&lt;ref name=Schmeh&gt;{{citation|last=Schmeh|first=Klaus| title = The Pathology of Cryptology—A Current Survey | journal =Cryptologia|volume= 36 | year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group|location=London|pages=14–45|doi = 10.1080/01611194.2011.632803 | quote = Arguments against archeocryptography are…: There are many numbers involved, which can be arranged in many different formulas and matched against many different values. Munck’s claims, therefore, would only be valid with a statistical foundation that proves that his findings are more than merely coincidence. However, Munck has never provided a proof like this. | postscript = , at pp. 19–20. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The word ''archaeocryptography'' is derived from ''archaeology'', which is the study of [[human]] activity in the past, and ''[[cryptography]]'', which is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.

== Methods ==
[[File:Biholomorphism illustration.svg|thumb|Mathematical coordinates including π may be used to form Grid Point Values]]Archaeocryptologists try to find underlying correlations in respect that which is being studied or decoded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lauralee.com/munck.htm |title=Archaeocryptography, Carl Munck |author=Laura Lee |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some factors taken into consideration while deciphering an object, structure or [[megalith]]ic monument can include the features such as faces, stairs, sides, and terraces.  The [[geolocation]] or mathematical operations are performed on latitude and longitude coordinates&lt;ref name="Munck" /&gt; as well as astronomical alignments, such as are found with [[archaeoastronomy]]. The incorporation of grids,&lt;ref name=Wilcock&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcock|first=David|title=Chapter 11: Global Grid 2|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|url=http://divinecosmos.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of numerical ordering, mathematical constants, Biblical [[gematria]], and any other re-occurring number that might stand out from the decoding process are determining factors.

Archaeocryptologists then can use different mathematical formulas to find correlations within that which is being studied or between other monuments or structures that share any underlying factors. Popular examples are the [[Orion correlation theory]] &lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Alexandra|title=Science or Superstition (The Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon)|year=2009|publisher=The Disinformation Company|isbn=978-1-934708-28-6|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and the [[Orion's Belt|three middle stars]] of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]], and also theories&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever | last = Hoagland | first = Richard C. | publisher = Berkeley | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-9381-907-83 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xBBMGwAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the region of [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Cydonia]] on [[Mars]].

== History ==
The coining of the word ''archaeocryptography'' is often attributed to Carl P. Munck,&lt;ref name="Schmeh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatdreams.com/gem10.htm |title=Geomorphic Resonance, by Michael Lawrence Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt; who after retiring from the United States military in the late 1970s began studying [[Cartography|cartographic]] material, among other topics, trying to search for better answers as to why certain megalithic monument exist. This led him to a formula he believes architects used to place and design various megalithic monuments.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=L |title=Archaeocryptography According to Carl Munck |url=http://www.atlantisrising.com/backissues/issue9/ar9archeocrypto.html |work=Magazine, Issue 9 |publisher=Atlantis Rising |access-date=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123118/http://www.atlantisrising.com/backissues/issue9/ar9archeocrypto.html |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Munck's theory claims that calculations using selected numbers or dimensions found in megalithic monuments or [[Egyptian pyramids]] yield the [[latitude]] or [[longitude]] of the site.&lt;ref name=Schmeh/&gt; However, in Munck's findings, the [[prime meridian]] does not run through [[Greenwich]], but through the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in [[Giza]]. His theory is known simply as "The Code" and asserts that an ancient Jewish numerological system known as [[gematria]] is used in the manipulation of numbers to other key locations, mathematical components and positions of sights in the geometry of their construction.

The theory later become popularized and among other practitioners and researchers in pseudo-scientific fields, such as Michael Lawrence Morton, [[Richard C. Hoagland]], [[Bruce Cathie]], and Hugh Harleston Jr. They adapted archaeocryptography to their own studies, developing different theories &lt;ref name="bruce"&gt;

== In literary studies ==
The marginal, or even fictional, status of archaeocryptography was suggested in [[Zachary Mason]]'s novel ''[[The Lost Books of the Odyssey]]'', which purports to be a collection of lost works which the author describes as being as old as the [[Odyssey]] and which he claims to have decoded from a manuscript he had uncovered. In the author's biography at the conclusion of the book he describes himself as "the John Shade Professor of Archaeocryptography and Paleomathematics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]". The "lost books" were actually written by Mason and, as reviewers have noted, Mason is a novelist and computer scientist who lives in California, [[John Shade]] is a fictional poet in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', and no such professorship exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Taoka | first = Yasuko | year = 2012 | title = A Liar's Yarn: Storytelling in ''The Lost Books of the Odyssey'' | journal = New Voices in Classical Reception Studies | issue = 7 | pages = 40–48  | url = http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/newvoices/Issue7/Yasuko-Taoka.pdf | access-date = 8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Calculus of Writing, Applied to a Classic|first=Larry|last=Rohter|date=February 9, 2010|access-date=9 January 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/books/10mason.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">The '''Arts and Humanities Data Service''' ('''AHDS''') was a [[United Kingdom]] national service aiding the discovery, creation and preservation of digital resources in and for research, teaching and learning in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]]. It was established in 1996 and ceased operation in 2008 (although the website and related digital collections are still accessible).

Organised via a Managing Executive at [[King's College London]] and five AHDS Centres, hosted by various UK Higher Education Institutions, the AHDS was funded until the end of March 2008 by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC).  

However, in March 2007 the AHRC decided to cease funding for the AHDS beyond March 2008. As a result, the AHDS is now advising AHRC applicants to ensure their projects include a budget for the costs of preservation and sustainability (whether with the AHDS or another service).

Following the demise of AHDS, and the cessation of the [[Methods Network]], the [[Centre for e-Research (CeRch)]] was established at [[King's College London]] in 2008. The Centre's aims are to facilitate interdisciplinary, institutional, national and international collaboration.

The five subject-based AHDS Centres are:

*[[AHDS Archaeology]] — [[University of York]]
*[[AHDS History]] — [[University of Essex]]
*[[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] — [[Oxford University]]
*[[AHDS Performing Arts]] — [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute|HATII]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]
*[[AHDS Visual Arts]] — [[University for the Creative Arts]] (Farnham campus)

Specific areas of work that the Arts and Humanities Data Service covers include:

*[[digital preservation]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/ahds-preservation-documents.htm preservation handbooks] detailing specific preservation issues with various digital file formats and information on its [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/repository.htm digital repository]
*Advice on [[digitization]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/case-studies/ case studies] of existing digitization projects, [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/information-papers/ information papers] on specific issues in digitization, and longer [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/guides Guides to Good Practice] dealing with digitization topics in particular arts and humanities disciplines
*Online collections created by universities and museums in the UK. These include:
**[http://ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/ An online catalogue] with details of collections held within the archive
**[http://www.ahds.rhul.ac.uk/ahdscollections/ Designing Shakespeare] — 40 years of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] performance in [[London]] and [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]]

==The Cosmere==
Sanderson writes many of his works in an overarching universe known as the ''[[Cosmere]]'' with series tending to be on different planets within that universe. The works, especially the magic systems within them, are often subtly connected, and some characters appear across the various series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's talk about Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere|url=http://www.tor.com/2015/07/21/lets-talk-about-brandon-sandersons-cosmere/|website=Tor.com|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aether of Night'' series===
Announced with very few details. "Seeds" of the story are in multiple other ''Cosmere'' books.&lt;ref name="2016 SotS"/&gt;

===''Dragonsteel'' series===
This story (the story of the shattering of Adonalsium, as told by Hoid) is next-to-last in Sanderson's sequence of Cosmere novels (though it is first chronologically). It will probably be released once ''Stormlight'' volume 10 is done.&lt;ref name="2016 SotS"/&gt;

In law, a '''case stated''' is a procedure by which a court or tribunal can ask another court for its opinion on a point of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case stated|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/case-stated|work=CollinsDictionary.com|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Magistrates Courts Act, 1980, section 111|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/111|publisher=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two kinds: consultative case stated and appeal by way of case stated. A consultative case stated is made at the discretion of a judge before he or she determines the case before the court. An appeal by way of case stated is made at the request of a party to the proceedings to the judge after the conclusion of a case.

On the hearing of a case stated, the higher court is restricted to consideration of the law alone and is required to accept the statement of facts submitted to it by the lower court.

If the application is granted, the matter is referred to the higher court. This usually takes the form "were we/was I correct to ..." and then the specified aspect of law to which the appeal relates. If the application to state a case is refused, the applicant may be able to seek redress by [[judicial review]]. The higher court will determine whether or not the law was correctly applied. If the appeal is upheld, the higher court will refer the case back to the referring court with directions to correct its decision. Otherwise, the appeal would be dismissed.

'''''Creep''''' is a 2014 American [[Independent film|independent]] [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Patrick Brice]], based on a story written by Brice and [[Mark Duplass]], and is Brice's [[directorial debut]], as well. Creep premiered on March 8, 2014, at [[South by Southwest]], and was released on [[video on demand]] on June 23, 2015, by [[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]] prior to an international release via [[Netflix]] on July 14, 2015.&lt;ref name=netflixitunes&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Finds ‘Creep’ Footage For July Premiere|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3344787/netflix-finds-creep-footage-july-premiere/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film follows Aaron (portrayed by Brice), a videographer who answers an ad, created by Josef (portrayed by Duplass). As they get closer together, he discovers that his client is not who he was expecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayne|first=Zach|title=SXSW 2014 Interview: Talking to CREEP's Mark Duplass And Patrick Brice|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/03/sxsw-2014-interview-talking-to-creeps-mark-duplass-and-patrick-brice.html|work=[[Twitch Film]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Aaron ([[Patrick Brice]]) is a [[videographer]] who decides to work for Josef ([[Mark Duplass]]) after answering his ad. All Aaron has to do is record Josef throughout the day. Aaron drives up to a secluded home up a steep driveway. After making him wait for quite a while, upon arrival, Josef insists on hugging Aaron, and insinuates there will be "more of that to come." Josef explains that the home is his family vacation home, and that he beat cancer two years earlier but now has a large brain tumor. His wife, Angela, is pregnant, and Aaron will be recording a series of videos for Josef's unborn son, as he is dying and will never be able to see him grow up. Josef tells Aaron that he and his wife are calling the baby "Buddy." Josef's first request for Aaron is to record him taking a bath with Buddy. He simulates holding a baby, then pretends to drown to scare Aaron.  

Later, Josef asks Aaron to go hiking with him. While getting a jacket, Aaron is startled by a wolf mask in the closet; Josef tells him that his father used to wear the mask, pretending to be a friendly wolf named Peachfuzz. While hiking, Josef claims to know of a secret place with "healing waters" and leads Aaron to a hidden waterfall. He writes "J+A" on a large stone with a rock, drawing a heart around the initials. Throughout their time together, Josef repeatedly scares Aaron, excusing his behavior by claiming he has a "weird sense of humor."

At a restaurant after their hiking trip, Aaron becomes suspicious that Josef has never been to this restaurant, or even the area. Josef asks Aaron if he has ever been ashamed of anything. Aaron tells him that as a child, he would often pee himself to a point where he wore a monitor to alert him when it became wet. Josef then admits to Aaron that while Aaron was waiting for Josef's arrival, he took photos of him standing by the front door. Josef says it was only because he wanted to get to know Aaron before meeting him and apologizes profusely. 

As Aaron gets ready to leave that night, Josef asks him to stay for a drink. Aaron is already suspicious of Josef's behavior and insist on leaving, but reluctantly agrees to join him. Josef asks Aaron to turn off the camera, claiming that what he was going to say was not appropriate for Buddy. Aaron shuts off the video but leaves the sound on. Josef tells him he lied about Peachfuzz, and he wore the wolf mask in order to rape his wife to confirm his suspicions about her [[animal pornography]] habit. An unsettled Aaron then attempts to leave, but is unable to find his keys. Josef tells Aaron that he should wait to leave till the morning, that it will be easier to find the keys and to sleep off the alcohol. Aaron agrees. He then drugs Josef's whiskey with Benadryl, and lays him to sleep. Josef begins to talk in his sleep, saying very disturbing things to Aaron and even begins to touch himself. Aaron attempts to search Josef for his keys when Josef's phone begins to ring. Aaron answers the phone to Josef's "wife," who tells Aaron that she is really his sister, and that her brother has problems. She insist that he leaves the house, with or without his keys. The call drops, and Aaron returns to find Josef gone. Aaron searches the home until Josef scares him again and tells him that he doesn't want to die. Aaron tells Josef that he spoke to his sister, and that he wants to help Josef. Josef becomes angry and runs back into the home. Aaron attempts to leave, but finds Josef blocking the front door with the Peachfuzz mask on. Aaron asks Josef to please let him leave, in which Josef shakes his head 'no' and begins to growl and grope the door. Aaron charges at him, and the camera shuts off.

When the video resumes, Aaron reveals that he escaped and made it home, but soon received a DVD in the mail from Josef. It depicts Josef dragging filled trash bags up a hill, and burying them. Aaron thinks it is meant as a threat but does not call the police.

Aaron admits that he has been having terrible nightmares about Josef wearing a wolf mask and Aaron wearing a baby mask, dancing in the waterfall they previously visited. Aaron then receives a large box with a knife and a stuffed wolf in it, as well as another DVD with a video of Josef apologizing and saying that he really cares about Aaron. Josef now repeatedly calls Aaron "Buddy" in the videos. Per Josef's instructions, Aaron rips open the stuffed wolf to find a locket with Josef's and Aaron's pictures in it. Upset, Aaron throws everything away. 

Aaron decides to go to the police, which are no help due to the fact that he does not know anything about Josef, including his full name. That night, Aaron hears odd noises in his home which prompts him to investigate. As Aaron searches his home, Josef can be seen looking through the front door. Josef runs away as Aaron approaches. Aaron does not see Josef, and goes to the alleyway only to find his trash knocked over. Later that night as Aaron sleeps, Josef turns on the camera and films Aaron, even cutting off a piece of Aaron's hair. Aaron wakes up to find that the screen in his window ripped, and another DVD labeled "My Last Video" next to his bed. Josef, in the video, apologizes again, revealing that he found the locket in Aaron's trash, which hurt him greatly. He claims this led to the realization that he needs help, as he is sad and needs a friend. He asks Aaron to come to a public lake by his house to talk so they could finally have "closure." His pleas move Aaron enough to compel him to go to the lake. Aaron leaves the camera rolling from his car and has 911 on speed dial just in case. Upon arrival Aaron does not find Josef, and sits on a bench overlooking the lake to wait for him. Josef is seen approaching Aaron from behind and stands there for a few moments, before putting on the Peachfuzz mask. He then sneaks closer to Aaron and reveals an axe in his hand. Still unbeknownst to Aaron, Josef stands behind Aaron with the axe over him, before he swings it into Aaron's skull, killing him instantly.

Josef is then shown filming himself watching the murder tape, which he has already done several times before. He expresses admiration and even puzzlement at Aaron's naivety and kindness, and claims he loves him and considers him to be his favorite "of them all." 

He puts a DVD labeled "Aaron &lt;3" in a cabinet full of videos and DVDs with different people's names on them, as he identifies himself as Bill over the phone while speaking to yet another person about hiring them to film him.

==Production==
Duplass said that the film's story "was inspired by character-driven dramas that are, at their heart, two-handers: ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'', ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'', and ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''" as well as "[his] myriad of strange [[Craigslist]] experiences over the years."&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{cite web|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=Mark Duplass Is a Creep|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-07-14/mark-duplass-is-a-creep/|publisher=''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brice and Duplass originally began working on ''Creep'' under the working title ''Peachfuzz'', but chose to rename the film as the title's relevance came later in the movie's plot and they did not want viewers to "spend the first half hour trying to figure out why the movie is called Peachfuzz and [not] pay attention to the very intricate details".&lt;ref name=STYD&gt;{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=SXSW Interview: Mark Duplass, Patrick Brice on Bringing Creep to Life|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/349719-sxsw-interview-mark-duplass-patrick-brice-on-bringing-creep-to-life/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two built the movie from a series of conversations they had with one another and decided to refine ''Creep'' while they were filming, which enabled them to film and screen portions of the film to see what would or wouldn't work on camera.&lt;ref name=STYD /&gt; As a result, the film had multiple alternate end scenarios and Duplass stated that there were "10 to 12 permutations of each scene".&lt;ref name=STYD /&gt;

Of the creative process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained "We were interested in the psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don’t quite understand what’s up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe a little bit too much love here and there. But, for me, there’s something wrong with both of these guys. Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'"&lt;ref name=BD&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Duplass And Patrick Brice On Mixing Comedy And Terror In 'Creep'!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3282601/sxsw-14-interview-mark-duplass-and-patrick-brice-on-mixing-comedy-and-terror-in-creep/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after ''Creep's'' premiere at [[South by Southwest]], Duplass announced that he intended to film a sequel and after the film distribution rights were purchased by [[Radius-TWC|RADiUS-TWC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=Radius-TWC Partners With Blumhouse, Duplass Brothers on 'Creep' Trilogy|url=http://www.thewrap.com/radius-twc-partners-blumhouse-duplass-brothers-creep-trilogy/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he further announced that he was planning on creating a trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Duplass and Patrick Brice Discuss Their Craigslist Nightmare 'Creep'|url=http://screenrant.com/mark-duplass-patrick-brice-creep-movie/|publisher=ScreenRant|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yamato|first1=Jen|title=Radius-TWC Springs For Blumhouse-Duplass SXSW Thriller 'Creep'; Trilogy In The Works|url=http://deadline.com/2014/04/radius-twc-blumhouse-duplass-thriller-creep-710902/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Duplass further stated that he and Brice planned on filming the second ''Creep'' film at the end of the year, that the film's cast would be announced during that time, and that the trilogy would be completed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Duplass Says CREEP 2 Will Shoot at the End of the Year; Aiming to Release the Entire CREEP Trilogy Next Year|url=http://collider.com/mark-duplass-creep-trilogy-release/|publisher=Collider|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2015, Duplass commented that neither he nor Brice had been able to start filming on ''Creep 2'' due to scheduling issues, as the careers of both men had greatly expanded since ''Creep''{{'s}} release, but that the both of them were still actively developing the project.&lt;ref name="Moviefone sequel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|title=Mark Duplass on 'Lazarus Effect' and Turning Down 'Huge Movies' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/02/27/mark-duplass-lazarus-effect-interview/|publisher=Moviefone|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Duplass &amp; Brice announced discussions had begun on the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MarkDuplass/status/734766086227435520|title=CREEP 2 discussions have officially begun.|website=[[Twitter]]|first=Mark|last=Duplass|date=May 23, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/patrick_brice/status/734799843428687873|title=CREEP 2|website=[[Twitter.com]]|first=Patrick|last=Brice|date=May 23, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Duplass revealed that he had begun trying on costumes for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3403159/mark-duplass-confirms-creep-2-works/|title=Mark Duplass Confirms ‘Creep 2’ in the Works|website=[[Bloody-Disgusting]]|first=Jonathan|last=Barkan|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''droit''' ([[French language|French]] for ''[[right]]'' or ''[[Law]]'') is a legal title, claim or due.

==Droits of admiralty (English law)==
{{Update-EB|section=yes|date=March 2016}}
The term is used in [[English law]] in the phrase "[[droits of admiralty]]".  This refers to certain customary rights or perquisites, formerly belonging to the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]], but now to the crown, for public purposes and paid into the [[Exchequer]]. These ''droits'' (see also [[Shipwreck|wreck]]) consisted of [[flotsam]], [[jetsam]], ligan -  (goods or wreckage on the sea bed that is attached to a buoy so that it can be recovered), [[treasure]], [[deodand]], [[derelict (maritime)]], within the admiral's jurisdiction; all [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]], [[ransom]]s, [[recognizance]]s and pecuniary punishments; all [[sturgeon]]s, [[whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[orca|grampuses]] and such large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road or port, by durance or mistake; all ships seized at sea, salvage, etc., with the share of prizes such shares being afterwards called "tenths", in imitation of the French, who gave their admiral a ''droit de dixième''. The droits of admiralty were definitely surrendered for the benefit of the public by Prince [[George of Denmark]], when Lord High Admiral of England in 1702. [[American law]] does not recognize any such droits, and the disposition of captured property is regulated by various acts of [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

==Other legal connexions (French law, etc.)==
The term ''droit'' is also used in various legal connexions (i.e., [[French law]]), such as the ''droit'' of [[angary]], the ''droit d'achat'' ([[right of pre-emption]]) in the case of [[contraband]], the [[feudal]] ''droit de bris'' (see wreck), the ''[[droit de regale]]'' or ancient royal privilege of claiming the revenues and patronage of a vacant [[Diocese|bishopric]], and the feudal droites of [[seignory]] generally.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

In French, ''droit'' can mean ''the whole body of the [[Law]]'', as in the motto "[[dieu et mon droit]]," which is to say "God and my whole body of Law."  ''Droit d'auteur'' is a term for [[French copyright law]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">[[File:Herzogshut Liechtenstein 1756.jpg|thumb|Ducal hat and insignia of the princely Liechtenstein [[primogeniture]] (gouache from 1756, Liechtenstein Museum)]]
The '''Ducal hat of Liechtenstein''' (German: ''Herzogshut'') is a former crown of the [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Princes of Liechtenstein]], who were also [[Duchy of Troppau|Dukes of Troppau and Jägerndorf]]. It went missing in the 18th century.

== History ==
The ducal hat of Liechtenstein was commissioned in 1623 by Prince [[Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Karl I of Liechtenstein]] and completed in 1626. It was discovered to be missing in 1781,&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Liechtenstein: The Princely Collections {{ISBN|0-87099-385-2}} Metropolitan Museum of Art, Middle Village, New York, U.S.A., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; following the death of Prince [[Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Joseph I]], and it remains lost to the [[House of Liechtenstein]] since that time.

In 1976, the people of Liechtenstein presented a replica of the crown to Prince [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Josef II]] on his 70th birthday.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; The replica is based on the only drawing of the crown, dated 1756, and is [http://www.tourismus.li/en/our-country/Liechtenstein-highlights/Highlights-Liechtenstein/Princely-Crown-National-Museum on display in the Liechtenstein National Museum].

The circlet of the crown was modeled on the circlet of the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]], while eight jeweled acanthus leaves, alternately large and small, rested on the rim of the circlet. As with the imperial crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], the precious stones used in this crown were white (diamonds and pearls) and red (rubies or red spinels), which may have had some alchemist significance. Inside the crown was a red velvet cap topped with a large jeweled button.

The gems used on the crown were chosen in accordance with the alchemical principles subscribed to in the Rudolphine Court, with the crown apparently being designed to protect its possessor against evil.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gembook"&gt;Gemmarum et lapidum historia (Hanau, 1609)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Emperor Rudolph's physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt]] (1550–1632), diamonds have an inherent power that wards off evil spirits, rubies protect against illness and poison and will warn the wearer when danger threatens by turning dark, and pearls strengthen the health of the wearer and counter the effects of poison.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qbook"&gt;Quellenband, {{ISBN|3-205-06271-X}} (EAN: 9783205062714 / 978-3205062714, Böhlau 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The only depiction of the original crown dates from 1756, a [[gouache]] painting that is kept in the [[Liechtenstein Museum]].

===Three Comprehensive Categories of Knowledge===
[[Image:Universal Categories.jpg|right|thumb|The Three Peircean Categories]]
Using the [[trikonic]] categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness developed by American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Earthscore splits knowledge into three modes of being: firstness (positive quality), secondness (actual fact), and thirdness (laws that will govern facts in the future), and defines these categories as "a theory of everything".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Three Person Solution: Creating Sustainable Collaborative Relationships|author=Ryan, P.|date=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535047|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EQk8oG7wFPUC|page=60|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earthscore3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/earthscore_eco/earthscore_notational_system.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102039/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/earthscore_eco/earthscore_notational_system.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=The Earthscore Notational System|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstness is positive quality in the realm of spontaneity, freshness, possibility, and freedom. Earthscore defines firstness as being "as is", without regard for any other. Examples include: the taste of banana, warmth, redness, and feeling gloomy.&lt;ref name="experimentaltvcenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/history/people/pview.php3?id=42|title=People &amp;#124; The History Project|publisher=experimentaltvcenter.org|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondness is a two-sided consciousness of effort and resistance engendered by being up against brute facts. Earthscore defines secondness as the "facticity", or "thisness", of something, as it exists, here and now, without rhyme or reason. Examples include: pushing against an unlocked door and meeting silent, unseen resistance.&lt;ref name="stichting-mai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stichting-mai.de/hwg/amb/aai/art_as_inquiry_13.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716215839/http://www.stichting-mai.de/hwg/amb/aai/art_as_inquiry_13.htm|archive-date=2004-07-16|dead-url=yes|title=M.J.Bijvoet - Art As Inquiry|author=Marga Bijvoet|accessdate=2015-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdness mediates between secondness and firstness, between fact and possibility. ''Earthscore'' defines thirdness as the realm of habit and laws that will govern facts in the future, and posits that a knowledge of thirdness can allow predictions of how certain future events will turn out. It is an 'if...then' sort of knowledge. Thirdness consists in the reality that future facts of secondness will conform to general laws.&lt;ref name="earthscore3"/&gt;

===The Relational Circuit===

The relational circuit is a self-penetrating, tubular continuum with six unambiguous positions which attempts to supply a [[Continuum (topology)|topological continuum]] to the [[trikonic]] categories. The circuit organizes differences in terms of firstness, secondness, and thirdness, and three "in-between" positions that connect them within the continuum. The relational circuit is to the Earthscore System what the staff and bars are to classical music notation, and is the basis of the third component, threeing.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/leonardo/v039/39.3ryan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthscore.org/articles/ed_creating_curriculum_two.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electricity-tool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricity-tool.com/doc/216963-Component-Two:-The-Relational-Circuit/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710181115/http://www.electricity-tool.com/doc/216963-Component-Two%3A-The-Relational-Circuit/|archive-date=2011-07-10|dead-url=yes|title=Component Two: The Relational Circuit-Electricity Tool &amp;#124; electricity tool|accessdate=2015-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threeing===

Threeing is a practice in which three people take turns playing three different roles; initiator, respondent and mediator, in an attempt to solve relational confusion. The roles correspond to the categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness.

===The Firstness of Thirdness===

Earthscore utilizes the Firstness of Thirdness as a means of creativity, in an attempt to imagine an ecologically sustainable life before living it. By incorporating pure firstness as the realm of spontaneity, Earthscore uses the disciplines of [[Zen]], [[yoga]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] to cultivate the human capacity to be comfortable in pure firstness and yield new insights and visions.

===The Semiotic System for Interpretation===

Earthscore approaches knowledge as a process of generating signs, and incorporates the semiotic system of Charles Sanders Peirce consistent with the trikonic categories: A sign (firstness) representing an object (secondness) for an interpretant (thirdness). Earthscore exfoliates the threefold division into  a sixty-six-fold classification of signs that is inclusive of everything in nature, in order to systematize both interdisciplinary and multimedia representations of ecosystems.

'''Elder Pastitsios''' ({{lang-ell|Γέρων/Γέροντας Παστίτσιος}}, ''Géron/Gérontas Pastítsios'') is a [[Satire|satirical]] figure of a fictitious [[monk]] who first appeared in a [[Facebook page]]. The satire is mostly based on the famous [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monk [[Elder Paisios of Mount Athos|Elder Paisios]], with his name and face substituted by [[pastitsio]] — a local [[pasta]] and [[béchamel sauce]] dish, thus combining Greek Orthodox and  [[Pastafarian]] imagery.&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/gerontas.pastitsios/timeline?filter=2|title=ΓΕΡΟΝΤΑΣ ΠΑΣΤΙΤΣΙΟΣ - ELDER PASTITSIOS|last1=Loizos|first1=Philippos|publisher=Facebook|date=2012|language=Greek|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The page ran for about a year until it was closed down after the arrest of its creator for [[blasphemy]] on [[Portal:Current events/2012 September 21|September 21, 2012]]. The case, which started as a Facebook [[Flaming (Internet)|flame]], reached the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] twice and created a strong local as well as international [[political]] impact.

==Background==
The main satire of the page revolved around [[Elder Paisios]] (d. 1994), a monk from [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]], famous for his spiritual teachings. Much has been written about his person and his prophecies concerning the [[End time]]s, the upbringing of children, couples' relationships, even the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] Paisios supposedly followed. High-ranking priests as well as believers have proposed that the Elder should be [[glorification|recognised]] as a [[Saint]] by the [[Greek Orthodox church|Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt; The page criticised, among others, the exploitation of Paisios by the press and by Orthodox [[website]]s that propagate the alleged [[prophecies]] and teachings of the [[charisma]]tic Elder (according to his followers he had predicted the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and the recent [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek crisis]]).&lt;ref name=prin /&gt;

The "Elder Pastitsios" page satirised and criticised (with no reported profanity according to the media),&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt; various [[Orthodoxy in Greece|religious aspects in Greece]] such as [[infant baptism]], [[religious education]] in schools and the lack of separation between [[church and state]]; these were presented through the eyes of the [[Pastafarian]] [[Parody religion|satirical pseudo-religion]] "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster", which has been used to lampoon the teaching of [[creationism]] in schools.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt;

The page created a [[hoax]] about a posthumous [[miracle]] by Elder Paisios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fimes.gr/2012/09/gerontas-pastitsios/|script-title=el:Το θαύμα που επινόησε ο Γέρων Παστίτσιος|publisher=fimes.gr|date=September 26, 2012|language=Greek|trans-title=The miracle that Elder Pastitsios invented|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was submitted to various Orthodox, conservative and far-right blogs in July. The story was based on several existing accounts that were already [[reblogging|circulating online]] and involved the miraculous recovery of a teenager who supposedly woke from a [[coma]] after his mother placed a [[talisman]] with dirt from Elder Paisios’ grave under his pillow.

The story reached 93,800 [[Google search]] results and was reproduced both online and in print, and even became a cover story on the far-right newspaper "Eleftheri Ora".&lt;ref name=seleo /&gt; The 27-year-old page creator would later state that he did this to expose the gullibility of the faithful, and also to show the poor fact-checking done among the religious and conservative [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref name=vaxevanis /&gt;

Four days before the page creator's arrest, [[Member of Parliament|MP]] Christos Pappas from the far-right [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] party had brought the page to the attention of the [[Minister of Justice (Greece)|Minister of Justice]] by raising a [[Question time|question]] to the Greek Parliament on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpost.gr/post/155764/%CE%95%CF%81%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%92%CE%BF%CF%85%C3%8E-%CE%AE-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%A7%CF%81%CF%85%CF%83%CE%AE-%CE%91%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%AE-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD----%CE%93%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF/|script-title=el:Ερώτηση στη Βουλή από τη Χρυσή Αυγή για τον...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">'''Euphorium''' was a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] theater installation produced by [[Antenna Theater]] that ran from 2000 to 2002 in [[San Francisco, California]], [[London, England]], and [[Black Rock City, Nevada]].  

The piece is based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem, [[Kubla Khan]].  It was one of a series of installations Antenna Theater's director, Chris Hardman, describes as "walkmanology", in which audience members are guided through a set wearing headphone devices.  For Euphorium, the audience members were given specially-designed helmets that included not only stereo speakers, but also a periscope-like device by which they would view a diorama created on a room's ceiling as they walked slowly through the performance.  Infrared triggers would initiate various [[mp3]]-encoded audio segments as they passed.&lt;ref name=sfg/&gt;  The result was alternately described as an immersive [[multimedia]] performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Editing Environments: The Architecture of Electronic Texts|author=Neil Fraistat|url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/fqn032v1|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Gothic aesthetics|gothic]] theater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4fnEHOuZ6UC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=euphorium+coleridge|title=The Routledge Companion to Gothic|author=Catherine Spooner, Emma McEvoy|publisher=Routledge|date=2007|isbn=978-0-415-39843-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''For all practical purposes (FAPP)''' is a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] approach towards the problem of incompleteness of every [[science|scientific]] [[theory]] and the usage of [[Limit (mathematics)|asymptotical]] [[approximation]]s.

When a [[physicist]] makes an approximation - which can not be justified on rigorous grounds - he or she may attempt to justify it by saying the results obtained are good for all practical purposes (FAPP). Meaning they agree with our experience and [[approximation error]]s cannot be detected in practical [[measurement]]s (for instance, if the error is smaller than the measurement resolution).

FAPP theories are incomplete or lackly-based theories that nevertheless have very high agreement with experiments and tend to be very useful for all practical purposes.

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]". Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, John. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/782/pg782.txt The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]''. Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Clark|title=A Concise History of Florida|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBl3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22|date=23 September 2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-62585-153-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth were performed in 1934 by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

'''Frame semantics''' is a theory of [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]] that extends his earlier [[case grammar]]. It relates [[natural language|linguistic]] [[semantics]] to encyclopedic knowledge.
The basic idea is that one cannot understand the meaning of a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one would not be able to understand the word "sell" without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between the money and the goods, the relations between the seller and the goods and the money, the relation between the buyer and the goods and the money and so on.

Thus, a word activates, or evokes, a frame of semantic knowledge relating to the specific concept to which it refers (or highlights, in frame semantic terminology).

A '''semantic frame''' is a collection of facts that specify "characteristic features, attributes, and functions of a denotatum, and its characteristic interactions with things necessarily or typically associated with it." &lt;ref&gt;Keith Alan (2001, p. 251), Natural Language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A semantic frame can also be defined as a [[Coherentism|coherent structure]] of related concepts that are related such that without knowledge of all of them, one does not have complete knowledge of any one; they are in that sense types of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]&lt;ref&gt; needed &lt;/ref&gt;. Frames are based on recurring experiences. So the commercial transaction frame is based on recurring experiences of commercial transactions.

Words not only highlight individual concepts, but also specify a certain perspective from which the frame is viewed. For example "sell" views the situation from the perspective of the seller and "buy" from the perspective of the buyer. This, according to Fillmore, explains the observed asymmetries in many [[lexical semantics|lexical relations]].

While originally only being applied to [[lexeme]]s, frame semantics has now been expanded to [[grammatical construction]]s and other larger and more complex linguistic units and has more or less been integrated into [[construction grammar]] as the main semantic principle. Semantic frames are also becoming used in [[information model]]ing, for example in [[Gellish]], especially in the form of 'definition models' and 'knowledge models'.

Frame semantics has much in common with the semantic principle of profiling from [[Ronald Langacker|Ronald W. Langacker]]'s [[Cognitive Grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cruse (2004, p. 137f.), Meaning in Language. An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics. Second Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-19-926306-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''9/11 humor''' refers to jokes, whether in print or otherwise, based on the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] in [[New York City]], [[Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

A number of scholars have studied the ways in which humor has been used to deal with the trauma of the event,&lt;ref name="chron1"&gt;Brottman, Mikita (February 12, 2012). [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-So-Funny-About-9-11-/130708/ What's So Funny About 9/11?], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newfolk"&gt;Ellis, Bill (June 6, 2002).

[Cracking Up: American Humor in a Time of Conflict] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; including researcher Bill Ellis who found that jokes about the attacks originating in the USA the day afterwards, and Giselinde Kuipers found jokes on Dutch websites a day later.&lt;ref name=kuipers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuipers|first=Giselinde|date=March 2005|title="Where Was King Kong When We Needed Him?"

During a comedy roast for Hugh Hefner at the [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] his 9/11 gag did not go over well with the crowd. One audience member at the club yelled out "Too soon!", which has since become a common response to jokes told in the immediate wake of tragedies. Gottfried then improvised and performed [[The Aristocrats (joke)|"The Aristocrats"]] routine, which released a great deal of tension and got rousing applause from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/37437 |title=The Guardian |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010202828/http://www.observer.com/node/37437 |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc1"&gt;Holt, Jim (August 27, 2011).

In contrast to these early jokes about 9/11, late-night comedy shows and humorous publications did not appear for several weeks following the attacks.&lt;ref name=kuipers/&gt; ''[[The Onion]]'', a satirical newspaper, cancelled the issue that had been scheduled to be released on September 11, 2001, and then returned to print with a special edition on September 26, 2001, which was devoted to the attacks. When the issue was released, the newspaper staff felt trepidation over making humor of such a tragic event. "Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print," according to one staff writer. Despite this expectation, ''The Onion'' staff was quickly inundated with comments from readers, the vast majority of which were positive.&lt;ref name=Onion&gt;{{cite news|last=Stableford|first=Dylan|title=Remembering The Onion's 9/11 issue: 'Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print'|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/remembering-onion-9-11-issue-everyone-thought-last-162024809.html|accessdate=May 17, 2012|newspaper=The Cutline|publisher=Yahoo News|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they self-censored the article titled "America Stronger Than Ever, Say [[Pentagon Memorial|Quadragon]] Officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/fast-chat-onion-154021|title=Fast Chat: The Onion|date=2001-10-21|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first 9/11 jokes made by a major American comedian in the UK was one told by [[Joan Rivers]] in London in 2002. The joke concerned the widows of fire fighters killed in the attacks, who Rivers said would be disappointed if their husbands had been found alive as they would be forced to return money they had received in compensation for their late spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0069193/ |title=Joan Rivers Jokes About 9/11 Victims |date=May 1, 2002 |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=June 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The joke received condemnation from [[Harold Schaitberger]], General President of the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firehouse.com/news/10574582/iaff-rebuts-joan-rivers-humor-on-9-11 |title=IAFF Rebuts Joan Rivers Humor on 9-11 |accessdate=June 25, 2012 |publisher=International Association of Fire Fighters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
"The Zero" (2006) by [[Jess Walter]] is a post-911 satirical novel which features a New York City cop who shoots himself in the head and forgets it minutes later; his brain damage accounts for gaps in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet (September 11, 2006). "[[New York Times]]: "After the Cataclysm, a Surreal Drift of Failing Senses" https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/books/11masl.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern novel "[[United States of Banana]]" (2011) by Latin American author [[Giannina Braschi]] treats the entropic scenes of disaster on September 11 with black humor; the work describes New York City without the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] as a mouth unwilling to laugh because it is missing its two front teeth.&lt;ref name="Evergreen"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.evergreenreview.com/128/review_us_of_banana.shtml|quotation=Challenging the fear and repression of dissent in the age of terror, Giannina Braschi wickedly brings a black humorous touch to the entropic scenes of disaster, writing from the estranged perspective of a Puerto Rican in New York.|title=Review of "United States of Banana"|date=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121638/http://www.evergreenreview.com/128/review_us_of_banana.shtml|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, comedian Billy Domineau uploaded a [[spec script]] to the Internet that he had written for ''[[Seinfeld]]'',&lt;ref name="Spec script"&gt;{{cite web|last=Domineau|first=Billy|title="The Twin Towers"|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B50l484pDaMobXI2Wk5CX0NMbkU/view|publisher=[[Google Docs]]|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had aired its last episode in 1998, set in New York during the days after the attacks. He said later that it had started when he suggested "a 9/11 episode of ''Seinfeld''" to a student as an example of "an exercise in bad taste" for a class.&lt;ref name="EW Seinfled script article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kickham|first=Dylan|title=Seinfeld 9/11 spec script author says episode should've existed, but couldn't|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/04/seinfeld-911-spec-script-author-interview|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his episode, the show's four main characters follow plotlines typical of them, all related to the attacks: [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] becomes convinced that dust from the fallen towers is contaminating his food; [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]], initially relieved that she won't have to break up with a boyfriend who worked at the Twin Towers, finds herself engaged to him when he unexpectedly survives; [[George Costanza|George]] basks in the glory after he is mistaken for a hero who rescued people, and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] attempts to recover the high-quality [[box cutter]] he loaned to [[Mohammed Atta]]. Popular [[list of Seinfeld minor characters|minor characters]], such as George's parents and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], also make appearances. "[It] is indeed in bad taste, but it perfectly captures the self-obsessed way these characters would handle such a crisis," wrote ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="Seinfeld script"&gt;{{cite news|last=Czajkowski|first=Elise|title=Seinfeld 9/11 script: a work of genius or just pretty, pretty good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/seinfeld-911-script-billy-domineau|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 5, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animation==
In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Back to the Pilot]]", broadcast in November 2011, Brian and Stewie take a trip back in time during which Brian tips off his past self about 9/11 so that the old him can play hero and stop the terrorist attacks. This causes [[George W. Bush]] not to be re-elected, meaning a [[Second American Civil War|Second Civil War]] starts that leads to nuclear attacks on the Eastern Seaboard. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic wrote of the episode, "It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and it probably is. But avid ''Family Guy'' viewers live for "too soon" moments, no matter how sensitive the material."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/11/14/did-family-guys-911-satire-go-too-far-for-a-laugh/ |title=Did Family Guy's 9/11 Satire Go Too Far for a Laugh? |publisher=''Time'' |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |date=November 14, 2011 |last=Pous |first=Terri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', also thought the show had gone too far with the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/11/14/family-guy-911-episode/ |title='Family Guy' 9/11 gag: Did they finally go too far this time? |publisher=''Entertainment Weekly'' |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |date=November 14, 2011 |last=Semigran |first=Aly}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' also commented that it "squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/family-guy-on-911-attack-let-it-happen/ |title='Family Guy' On 9/11 Attack: "Let It Happen" |website=Deadline Hollywood |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, perhaps reflecting how the acceptability to mainstream broadcasters of jokes referencing the 9/11 attacks has evolved only gradually, the DVD release of the earlier [[Family Guy (season 5)|season five]] ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Meet the Quagmires]]", first broadcast in 2007, contained an extended scene which was removed from the episode as first broadcast. In the deleted scene, while [[time travel|traveling]] in time back to 1980s Quahog with Peter, Brian is confronted by the boyfriend of a woman he has been hitting on. In response to the boyfriend's challenge that he will fight Brian 'anywhere, any time', Brian invites the man to meet him "On top of the World Trade Center, September 11th 2001 at 8am", to which the boyfriend replies "I will be there pal. You think I'll forget, but I won't!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945076/quotes  imdb.com], Family Guy: Meet the Quagmires (2007), Quotes. Retrieved July 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Family Guy (season 7)|season seven]] episode "[[Baby Not On Board]]" features a scene in which the Griffin family visits [[Ground Zero]], which Peter erroneously believes is "where the first guy got [[AIDS]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpP7b2lUxVE&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Family Guy (season 6)|season six]] episode "[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]" had Peter committing [[identity theft]] against a fictionalized [[James Woods]], in retaliation of him doing the same and ruining his life. Peter appears on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' proving he is Woods, promoting a comedy film based on the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetvcritic.org/reviews/comedies/family-guy/season-15/back-to-the-woods/|title=Episode 9 - Back to the Woods|publisher=The TV Critic|author=Pierson, Robin|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve the chance of an Oscar award, a 9/11 joke was cut from [[Jean Dujardin]]'s 2012 comedy film ''[[The Players (film)|The Players]]''. The deleted scene featured a man [[seduction|seducing]] a woman in a New York apartment while an aircraft crashes into the World Trade Center in the background.

==In advertising==
In the days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks in 2016, Miracle Mattress of [[San Antonio, Texas]], briefly ran a commercial promoting a [[Discounts and allowances|sale]] themed around the occasion. In it the daughter of the store's owner, in conversation with two employees who stood behind her, explained how the store was recalling the Twin Towers' collapse by selling all its inventory at the price of [[Bed size|twin-sized]] mattresses for the weekend with the slogan "Twin Towers, Twin Price". At the end of the ad, she inadvertently pushed the two employees into twin piles of mattresses behind her, one of which was topped with the American flag; both collapsed. After briefly expressing shock and horror, she turned to the camera and said "We'll never forget".&lt;ref name="Miracle Mattress ad"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jamie Narrientos |date=September 8, 2016 |title=Mattress company airs offensive 9/11 commercial|medium=Online video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmM-2gj5Gc|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company soon pulled the ad, but copies were saved and uploaded to the Internet, where it and Miracle became the subject of intense and vociferous criticism. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said it "might be most offensive commercial ever". Its [[Yelp!]] and [[Facebook]] pages filled with disparaging comments and calls for boycotts; the store itself also received [[death threat]]. Owner Mike Bonnano, whose daughter had, as the chain's head of marketing, conceived the commercials and starred in it, apologized profusely but eventually decided to close the San Antonio location "indefinitely" pending disciplinary measures and donations to the [[9/11 Foundation]].  Miracle Mattress reopened a few days later.&lt;ref name="EW mattress ad story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=9/11-themed mattress ad might be most offensive commercial ever|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/09/911-mattress-ad|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online==
Memes have become a rather popular way of distributing jokes about 9/11. A lot of these memes play with or make fun of [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] such as "Bush did 9/11" or "jet fuel can't melt steel beams." There have also been viral Vine videos that joke about fictional characters or other famous people doing the attacks. In these vines, the creators have a clip of them, or something they throw, or perhaps  an aircraft they fly, and then cut to footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers (mostly [[United Airlines Flight 175|Flight 175]] hitting the South Tower). This makes fun of that character or real person, saying "(blank) did 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hess |first=Amanda |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/07/teenagers_and_9_11_trutherism_jokes_how_these_memes_became_a_phenomenon.html |title=Teenagers and 9/11 trutherism jokes: How these memes became a phenomenon.|date=July 6, 2015 |work=Slate Magazine |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''inalienable possession'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/08_springschool/pdf/course_materials/Haspelmath_Possessives.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|inal}}''') is a type of [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]  in which a [[noun]] is [[Obligatory possession|obligatorily possessed]] by its possessor. Nouns or [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal affixes]] in an inalienable possession relationship cannot exist independently or be "alienated" from their possessor.&lt;ref name="ling dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=P. H.|title=Inalienable possession|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001|year=2007|isbn=9780199202720}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''a hand'' implies "(someone's) hand", even if it is severed from the whole body. Likewise, ''a father'' implies "(someone's) father". Inalienable nouns include body parts (such as ''leg'', which is necessarily "someone's leg"), [[Kinship terminology|kinship terms]] (such as ''mother''), and part-whole relations (such as ''top'').&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lichtenberk|first1=Frantisek|last2=Vaid|first2=Jyotsna|last3=Chen|first3=Hsin-Chin|title=On the interpretation of alienable vs. inalienable possession: A psycholinguistic investigation|journal=Cognitive Linguistics|date=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=659–689|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/919350399?accountid=14656|accessdate=29 September 2014|doi=10.1515/cogl.2011.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many languages reflect this distinction, but they vary on how they mark inalienable possession.&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt; Cross-linguistically, inalienability correlates with many [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntactic]], and [[semantic]] properties.

In general, the alienable–inalienable distinction is an example of a binary possessive [[noun class|class system]], a language in which two kinds of possession are distinguished (alienable and inalienable). The alienability distinction is the most common kind of binary possessive class system, but it is not the only one.&lt;ref name = Nichols&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have more than two possessive classes.

== Comparison to alienable possession ==
The following real-world relationships often fall under inalienable possession:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type of relationship !! Examples
|-
| kinship || father, mother, aunt
|-
| social relationship || trading partner, neighbor
|-
| body parts || eye, leg
|-
| part-whole relationship  || tabletop, side
|-
| possessed noun originates from the possessor || sweat, voice
|-
| mental states and processes || fear, mind
|-
| attributes of a known possessor || name, age
|}

Other things, such as most objects, may or may not be possessed. When such types of objects are possessed, the possession is '''alienable'''. Alienable possession is used generally for tangible items that one might cease to own at some point (such as ''my money''), but inalienable possession generally refers to a perpetual relationship that cannot be readily severed (such as ''my mother'').&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Variation among languages ==
Although the relationships listed above are likely to be instances of inalienable possession, what is ultimately classified as inalienable depends on conventions, specific to the language and the culture.&lt;ref name=Heine2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|first1=Bernd|title=Cognitive Foundations of Grammar|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=9780195356205|pages=85–86|url=http://www.myilibrary.com?ID=52858|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible to say that a particular relationship is an example of inalienable possession without specifying the languages for which thar holds true. For example, ''neighbor'' may be an inalienable noun in one language but alienable in another.&lt;ref name=Heine2/&gt; Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as alienable or inalienable can be arbitrary, and in that respect, alienability is similar to other types of [[noun classes]] such as [[grammatical gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=P. H.|title=Noun class|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001|year=2007|isbn=9780199202720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The examples below illustrate that the same phrase, ''the table's legs'', is regarded as inalienable possession in [[Italian language|Italian]] but alienable possession in [[French language|French]]:&lt;ref name="Cinque and Krapova"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque]]|first1=Guglielmo|last2=Krapova|first2=Iliana|title=The two "possessor raising" constructions of Bulgarian|journal=Working Papers in Linguistics|date=2008|volume=18|pages=68|url=http://arca.unive.it/bitstream/10278/1085/1/Working%20Papers%2018-2008%20PDF.pdf#page=60|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1b) is [[grammaticality|ungrammatical]] (as indicated by the asterisk). French cannot use the inalienable possession construction for a relationship that is alienable.

[[Bernd Heine]] argues that [[language change]] is responsible for the language-specific variability in categorization. That is because "rather than being a semantically defined category, inalienability is more likely to constitute a [[morphosyntactic]] or [[morphophonological]] entity, one that owes its existence to the fact that certain nouns happened to be left out when a new pattern for marking attributive possession arose."&lt;ref name=Heine&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|first1=Bernd|title=Possession: Cognitive Sources, Forces, and Grammaticalization|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his view, nouns that are "ignored" by a new marking pattern come to form a separate noun class.

==Morphosyntactic strategies for marking distinction==
The distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is often marked by various morphosyntactic properties such as [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological markers]] and [[word order]]. There is a strong [[linguistic typology|typological]] pattern for inalienable possession to require fewer morphological markers than alienable possession constructions.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krasnoukhova|first1=Olga|title=Attributive possession in the languages of South America|journal=Linguistics in the Netherlands|date=2011|volume=28|issue=1|pages=86–98|doi=10.1075/avt.28.08kra}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Inalienable possession constructions involve two nouns or nominals: the possessor and the possessee. Together, they form a unit, called a [[determiner phrase]] (DP). Within the DP, the possessor nominal may occur either before the possessee ('''prenominal''') or after its possessee ('''postnominal'''), depending on the language.&lt;ref name = "Blackwell Companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guéron|first1=Jacqueline|editor1-last=Everaert|editor1-first=Martin|editor2-last=van Riemsdijk|editor2-first=Henk|title=The Blackwell Companion to Syntax|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9780470996591|pages=589–638|doi=10.1002/9780470996591|chapter=Inalienable Possession}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; French, for example, can use a postnominal possessor (the possessor ''(of) Jean'' occurs after the possessee ''the arm''):
[[File:Postnominal DP structure - French.png|thumb|150px|''de Jean'' is a '''postnominal possessor''', as it occurs after the noun. This sentence adapted from Guéron 2007: 590 (1a)]]
{|
|-
|
 (2) ''le  bras '''de Jean'''''
     the arm  '''of''' '''Jean'''
     'John's arm'

 (Guéron 2007: 590 (la))
|}

By contrast, English generally uses a prenominal possessor (''John'''{{'}}s''' brother''). However, in some situations, it may also use a postnominal possessor, as in ''the brother '''of John'''''.&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt;

===Morphological markers===
====No overt possessive markers====
The [[South American language]] [[Dâw language|Dâw]] uses a special possessive [[morpheme]] (bold in the examples below) to indicate alienable possession:&lt;ref name = Martins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martins|first1=Silvana Andrade|title=Fonologia e gramática Dâw|date=2004|publisher=LOT|location=Utrecht, Netherlands|pages=546–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
|-
|
 '''Alienable'''
 (3) ''tɔp   Tũk-'''ɛ̃̀ɟ'''''
     house Tũk-'''POSS'''
     'Tũk's house'

 (4) ''tih-'''ɛ̃̀ɟ'''   cɤ̀g''
     3SG-'''POSS''' arrow
     'his arrow'

 (Martins 2004: 546)
|}

The possessive morpheme '''''ɛ̃̀ɟ''''' in examples (3) and (4) indicates an alienable relationship between the possessor and the possessee.

{|
|-
|
 '''Inalienable'''
 (5) ''tih nũh''
     3SG head
     ‘his head'

 (Martins 2004: 547)
|}

The possessive marker does not occur in inalienable possession constructions. Thus, the absence of '''''ɛ̃̀ɟ''''', as in example (5), indicates that the relationship between the possessor and possessee is inalienable possession.

====Identical possessor deletion====
[[Igbo language|Igbo]], a [[West African language]], [[elision|deletes]] the possessor if the sentence's [[subject (grammar)|subject]]  and the possessor of an inalienable noun both [[reference|refer]] to the same entity.&lt;ref name=Hyman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyman|first1=Larry M.|last2=Alford|first2=Danny|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Akpati|title=Inalienable Possession in Igbo|journal=Journal of West African Languages|date=1970|volume=VII|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} In (6a), both the [[referent]]s are the same; however, it is ungrammatical to keep both of them in a sentence. Igbo employs the processes of identical possessor deletion, and the '''''yá''''' (''his''), is dropped, as in the grammatical (6b).

{|
|-
|
 (6a) *''Ó   sàra   áka   '''yá'''''
       He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; washed hands '''his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (own)'''
      'He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; washed his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hands'

 (6b) ''Ó  sàra    áka''
      He washed  hands
     'He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; washed his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hands'

 (Hyman et al. 1970: 87 (11, 12))
|}

===Word order===
====Possessor switch====
The distinction between alienable and inalienable possession constructions may be marked by a difference in word order. Igbo uses another [[syntax|syntactic]] process when the subject and the possessor refer to different entities.&lt;ref name=Hyman/&gt;{{rp|89}} In possessor switch, the possessor of the inalienable noun is placed as close as possible to the [[verb]].&lt;ref name=Hyman/&gt; In the following examples, the possessor '''''yá''''' is not deleted because the two referents in the following sentence are different:

{|
|-
|
 (7a) ''*Ó  hùru áka''
       He saw  hand
      'He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw his&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; hand'

 (7b) ''Ó  hùru áka  '''yá'''''
      He saw  hand '''his'''
     'He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw his&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; hand'

 (Hyman et al. 1970: 87 (27, 28))
|}
In the ungrammatical (8a), the verb ''wàra'' (''to split'') follows the possessor '''''m'''''. Possessor switch requires the verb to be placed closer to the possessor. The grammatical (8b) does so by having ''wàra'' switch with the possessor:

{|
|-
|
 (8a) ''*ísi  m  wàra''
       Head my split
       'I have a headache'
   
 (8b) ''ísi  wàra  m''
      Head split to me
      'I have a headache'

 (Hyman et al. 1970: 87 (44, 45))
|}

====Genitive-noun ordering====
[[Maybrat languages|Maybrat]], a language from [[New Guinea]], varies the order of the [[genitive case]] and the noun between alienable and inalienable constructions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dol|first1=Philomena|title=A Grammar of Maybrat: A Language of the Bird's Head, Irian Jaya, Indonesia|date=1999|location=University of Leiden|pages=93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dryer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryer|first1=Matthew S.|title=Order of Genitive and Noun|url=http://wals.info/chapter/86|website=The World Atlas of Language Structures Online|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In (9), the genitive '''''Sely''''' precedes the possessee '''''me''''', marking inalienable possession.
{|
|-
|
 '''Inalienable: Gen-N'''
 (9) ''Sely '''m-me'''''
      Sely '''3SG.F.POSS-mother'''
     'Sely's mother'

 (Dol 1999: 93)
|}
However, the genitive follows the possessee in alienable possession constructions, such as (10) whose genitive '''''Petrus''''' follows the possessee '''''amah'''''.
{|
|-
|
 '''Alienable: N-Gen'''
 (10) ''amah  '''ro'''-Petrus''
      house '''GEN'''-Petrus
      ‘Petrus' house'

 (Dol 1999: 97)
|}

===Explicit possessors===
Another way that languages can distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession is to have one noun class that cannot appear without an explicit possessor.&lt;ref name= Nichols4&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://wals.info/feature/description/58
| title = Obligatory Possessive Inflection
| work = [[World Atlas of Language Structures]]
|author1=Nichols, Johanna |author2=Bickel, Balthasar | accessdate = 2011-03-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]], has a class of nouns that must have explicit possessors.&lt;ref name =Valentine&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph ''Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 2001. §3.3.1. pg. 106 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "concise dictionary of Ojibwe"&gt;Nichols, J. D.; Nyholm, E. ''A Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Technically, the obligatory occurrence of a possessor is a property of certain morphemes called [[obligatory possession]], but linguists often use the term ''inalienable possession'' to mean that.}}

If explicit possessors are absent (as in (11b) and (12b)), the phrase is ungrammatical. In (11), the possessor '''''ni''''' is necessary for the inalienable noun '''''nik''''' (''arm''). In (12), the same phenomenon is found with the inalienable noun '''''ookmis''''' (''grandmother''), which requires the possessor morpheme '''''n''''' to be grammatical.
{|
|-
|
 '''Inalienable'''
 (11a) '''''ni'''   nik''
       '''POSS''' arm
       ''''my''' arm'

 '''Alienable'''
 (11b) *''nik''
        arm
      '(an) arm'

 (Nichols &amp; Nyholm 1995: 138)
|-
|
 '''Inalienable'''
 (12a) '''''n'''ookmis''
       '''POSS'''-grandmother
      ''''my''' grandmother'

 '''Alienable'''
 (12b) *''ookmis''
        grandmother
       '(a) grandmother'

 (Nichols &amp; Nyholm 1995: 189)
|}

===Prepositions===
[[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] uses different [[prepositions]] to mark possession, depending on alienability: '''''a''''' (alienable ''of'') is used to indicate alienable possession, as in (13a) and (14a), and '''''o''''' (inalienable ''of'') indicates inalienable possession.&lt;ref name = Elbert&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elbert|first1=Samuel H.|last2=Pukui|first2=Mary Kawena|title=Hawaiian Grammar|date=1979|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|location=Honolulu|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
|
 '''Alienable'''
 (13a) ''nā  iwi   '''a'''   Pua''
       the bones '''of'''  Pua
      'Pua's bones' [as in the chicken bones she is eating]

 '''Inalienable'''
 (13b) ''nā  iwi   '''o'''   Pua''
       the bones '''of'''  Pua
      'Pua's [own] bones'

 (Elbert &amp; Pukui 1979: 139)
|}

However, the distinction between '''''a''''' (alienable ''of'') and '''''o''''' (inalienable ''of'') is used for other [[semantic]] distinctions that are less clearly attributable to common alienability relationships except [[metaphor|metaphorically]]. Although ''lei'' is a tangible object, in Hawaiian  it can be either alienable (15a) or inalienable (15b), depending on the context.

{|
|-
|
 '''Alienable'''
 (14a) ''ke  kanaka '''a'''  ke  ali‘i''
       the man    '''of''' the king
      'the subject [controlled or appointed by] the chief'

 '''Inalienable'''
 (14b) ''ke  kanaka '''o'''  ke  ali‘i''
       the man    '''of''' the king
      'the [hereditary] subject of the chief'

 (Elbert &amp; Pukui 1979: 139)
|-
|
 '''Alienable'''
 (15a) ''ka  lei '''a'''  Pua''
       the lei '''of''' Pua
      'Pua's lei [to sell]'

 '''Inalienable'''
 (15b) ''ka  lei '''o'''  Pua''
       the lei '''of''' Pua
      'Pua's lei [to wear]'

 (Elbert &amp; Pukui 1979: 139)
|}

===Definite articles===
Subtler cases of syntactic patterns sensitive to alienability are found in many languages. For example, French can use a [[definite article]], rather than the [[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]], for body parts.&lt;ref name=Nakamoto&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakamoto|first1=Takeshi|title=Inalienable Possession Constructions in French|journal=Lingua|date=2010|volume=120|issue=1|pages=74–102|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2009.05.003}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
|
 (16) ''Il lève   '''les''' mains.'' 
      he raises '''the''' hands
     'He raises '''his''' hands.'

 (Nakamoto 2010: 75 (2a))
|}
Using the definite article with body parts, as in the example above, it creates [[ambiguity#Linguistic forms|ambiguity]]. The following sentence has both an alienable and an inalienable interpretation:
{|
|-
|
 a) he raises his own hands [inalienable]
 b) he raises another pair of hands [alienable]
|}

That type of ambiguity also occurs in English with body part constructions.&lt;ref name=VZ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vergnaud|first1=Jean-Roger|last2=Zubizarreta|first2=Maria Luisa|title=The Definite Determiner and the Inalienable Construction in French and in English|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=1992|issue=Vol. 23, no. 4|pages=595–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] also uses a definite article ('''''las''''') to indicate inalienable possession for body parts.&lt;ref name=Kockelman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kockelman|first1=Paul|title=Inalienable Possession as Grammatical Category and Discourse Pattern|journal=Studies in Language|date=2009|volume=33|issue=1|pages=29–30|doi=10.1075/sl.33.1.03koc}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
|-
|
 (17) ''él se      lava   '''las''' manos''
      he himself washes '''the''' hands
      'He washes '''his''' hands'

 (Kockelman 2009: 30)
|}

[[German language|German]] uses a definite article ('''''die''''') for inalienable body parts but a possessive ('''''meine''''') for alienable possession.&lt;ref name=Kockelman/&gt;
{|
|-
| 
 '''Inalienable'''
 (18) ''Er wäscht sich   '''die''' Hände.''
      he washes REFLEX '''the''' hands
      'He is washing '''his''' hands'

 (Kockelman 2009: 29)
|-
|
 '''Alienable'''
 (19) ''ich zerriß '''meine''' Hose''
      I   tore   '''my'''    pants
      'I tore '''my''' pants'

 (Kockelman 2009: 30)
|}

===No distinction in grammar===
Although English has alienable and inalienable nouns (''Mary's brother'' [inalienable] vs. ''Mary's squirrel'' [alienable]), there are few formal distinctions of that in the grammar.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Chris|editor1-last=Maienborn|editor1-first=Claudia|editor2-last=von Heusinger|editor2-first=Klaus|editor3-last=Portner|editor3-first=Paul|title=Semantics: An international handbook of natural language meaning|date=2011|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|location=Berlin|chapter-url=http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/WYxOTc5M/barker-possessives.pdf|chapter=Possessives and relational nouns}}&lt;/ref&gt; One subtle grammatical distinction is the postnominal genitive construction, which is normally used only for inalienable, relational nouns. For example, ''the '''brother''' of Mary'' [inalienable] is acceptable, but *''the '''squirrel''' of Mary'' [alienable] would be awkward.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Since the alienability distinction is rooted in semantics, in languages like English with few morphological or syntactic distinctions sensitive to alienability, ambiguities can occur. For example, the phrase ''she has her '''father's eyes''''' has two different meanings:
{|
|-
|
 a) her eyes resemble her father's [inalienable possession] &lt;br&gt;b) she is in actual physical possession of the eyes [alienable possession]
|}

Another example in [[dependency grammar#Semantic dependencies|semantic dependency]] is the difference between possible interpretations in a language that marks inalienable possession (such as French) with a language that does not mark it (such as English). Inalienable possession is semantically dependent and is defined in reference to another object to which it belongs.&lt;ref name=VZ/&gt; (20) is ambiguous and has two possible meanings. In the inalienable possessive interpretation, ''la main'' belongs to the subject, ''les enfants''. The second interpretation is that ''la main'' is an alienable object that does not belong to the subject. The English equivalent of the sentence (''The children raised the hand'') had only the alienable possessive reading in which the hand does not belong to the children.
{|
|-
|
 (20) ''Les enfants  ont  levé   '''la'''  main''
      The children have raised '''the''' hand
     'The children raised the hand'

 (Vergnaud and Zubizarreta 1992: 596 (1))
|}
Syntactically, [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed that some genitive or possessive cases originate as part of the [[determiner]] in the underlying structure.&lt;ref name = Stockwell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=Robert P.|last2=Schachter|first2=Paul|last3=Partee|first3=Barbara Hall|title=The Major Syntactic Structures of English|date=1973|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-03-088042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|680}} The inalienable possessives are derived from a different [[deep structure]] than that of alienable possession. For example, given the following interpretations of the [[phrase]] ''John's arm'':
{|
|-
|
 a) an arm that is part of John's body [inalienable]
 b) the arm that John happens to have physical possession of [alienable]

In the inalienable reading, ''arm'' is a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of the determiner phrase. That contrasts to the alienable reading in which ''John has an arm'' is part of the determiner.&lt;ref name=Stockwell/&gt;{{rp|690}} [[Charles J. Fillmore]] and Chomsky make a syntactic distinction between alienable and inalienable possession and suggest that the distinction is relevant to English.&lt;ref name=Stockwell/&gt;

In contrast, others have argued that although semantics plays a role in inalienable possession, it is not central to the syntactic class of case-derived possessives. For example, compare the difference between ''the book's contents'' and ''the book's jacket''. While a book cannot be divorced from its contents, it can be removed from its jacket.&lt;ref name=Stockwell/&gt;{{rp|690}} Still, both phrases have the same syntactic structure. Another example is ''Mary's mother'' and ''Mary's friend.'' The mother will always be Mary's mother, but an individual might not always be Mary's friend. Again, both have the same syntactic structure.

The distinction between alienable and inalienable possessions can be influenced by cognitive factors.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Languages such as English that do not encode the alienability distinction in their grammar rely on the real-world relationship between the possessed noun and possessor noun. Nouns that are "inherently relational" and whose possession is associated with a single, dominant interpretation (''mother''), are of the inalienable type, and nouns whose possession is open to interpretation (''car'') are of the alienable type.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Cross-linguistic properties==
Although there are different methods of marking inalienability, inalienable possession constructions usually involve the following features:&lt;ref name=Heine2/&gt;

* The distinction is confined to attributive possession.

* Alienable possession requires more [[phonological]] or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] features than inalienable possession.

*Inalienable possession involves a tighter structural bond between the possessor and the possessee.

* Possessive markers on inalienable nouns are [[etymologically]] older{{efn|For example, in the [[Native American language]] [[Kumeyaay people#Language|Diegueño]], the alienable possessive marker ('''''?-ə'''n&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;'') appears to originate from the inalienable possessive marker ('''''?-ə'''''), suggesting the latter to be older.&lt;ref name="space and time"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Johanna|title=Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=116–123|edition=ACLS Humanities E-Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Inalienable nouns include kinship terms and/or body parts.

* Inalienable nouns form a [[closed class]], but alienable nouns form an [[open class (linguistics)|open class]]. 
(Heine 1997: 85-86 (1-6))

===Restricted to attributive possession===
[[File:Attributive possession DP.jpg|thumb|170px|Attribution possession: the possessor (Ron) and the possesee (dog) form a [[phrase]].]]
 [[File:Predicative possession 1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Predicative possession: the possessor (Ron) and the possesee (dog) form not a phrase but instead a [[clause]].]]
Alienability can be expressed only in attributive possession constructions, not in predicative possession.&lt;ref name=Heine2/&gt;

Attributive possession is a type of possession in which the possessor and possessee form a [[phrase]]. That contrasts to predicative possession constructions in which the possessor and possessee are part of a [[clause]] and the verb affirms the possessive relationship.&lt;ref name="Herslund and Baron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herslund|first1=Michael|last2=Baron|first2=Irène|title=Dimensions of Possession|date=2001|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027229519|pages=1–15|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lcCKtWG3wsAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Dimensions+of+Possession#v=onepage&amp;q=Dimensions%20of%20Possession&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examples in (21) express the same alienable relationship between possessor and possessee but illustrate the difference between attributive and predicative possession:

{|

 (21a) Ron's dog

 '''Predicative possession'''
 (21b) Ron has a dog
 (21c) The dog is Ron's

 (Heine 1997: 87 (2))
|}

===Requires fewer morphological features===
If a language has separate alienable and inalienable possession constructions, and if one of the constructions is overtly marked and the other is "zero-marked", the marked form tends to be alienable possession. Inalienable possession is indicated by the absence of the overt marker.&lt;ref name=Haspelmath&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haspelmath|first1=Martin|title=Alienable vs. inalienable possessive constructions|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/08_springschool/pdf/course_materials/Haspelmath_Possessives.pdf|website=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology|publisher=Leipzig Spring School on Linguistic Diversity|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Inalienable possession#No overt possessive markers|data from Dâw]].

One typological study showed that in 78% of South American languages that distinguish between inalienable and alienable possession, inalienable possession was associated with fewer [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] markers than its alienable counterpart. By contrast, only one of the surveyed languages required more [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] features to mark inalienable possession than alienable possession.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; If a language makes a grammatical distinction between alienable and inalienable nouns, it is redundant to have an overt possessive marker to mark inalienability. Just by being inalienable, a noun must be possessed.

===Tighter structural bond between possessor and possessee===
In inalienable possession constructions, the relationship between the possessor and possesee is stronger than in alienable possession constructions. [[Johanna Nichols]] characterizes that by the tendency of inalienable possession to be [[head-marking language|head-marked]] but alienable possession to be [[dependent-marking language|dependent-marked]].&lt;ref name="space and time"/&gt; In head-marking, the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of an inalienable possession construction (the possessed noun) is marked, but in dependent-marking, the dependent (the possessor noun) is marked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=P. H.|title=Head marking|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001|year=2007|isbn=9780199202720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of representation in syntax==
Since the possessor is crucially linked to an inalienable noun's meaning, inalienable nouns are assumed to take their possessors as a semantic [[argument (linguistics)|argument]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guéron|first1=Jacqueline|title=The Blackwell Companion to Syntax, Volume I (Chapter 35)|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Ltd.|pages=595–596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possessors (to either alienable or inalienable nouns) can be expressed with different constructions. Possessors in the [[genitive case]] (such as ''the friend '''of Mary''''') appear as [[complement (linguistics)|complements]] to the possessed noun, as part of the phrase headed by the inalienable noun.&lt;ref name=VZ/&gt; That is an example of '''internal possession''' since the possessor of the noun is inside of the determiner phrase.

===External possession===
[[File:External possession structure.png|thumb|'''External possession''' in French. The possessor is outside the phrase that contains the possessee (circled in red). Sentence adapted from Vergnaud and Zubizarreta 1992: 596 (4b)]]
[[File:Internal possession structure - French.png|thumb|'''Internal possession''' in French. The possessor and possessee are contained inside the same phrase (circled in red). Sentence adapted from Vergnaud and Zubizarreta 1992: 596 (6b)]]
Inalienable possession can also be marked with '''external possession'''. Such are constructions have the possessor appearing outside the determiner phrase. For example, the possessor may appear as a dative complement of the verb.

French exhibits both external possessor construction and internal possessor construction, as in (22):&lt;ref name=VZ/&gt;
{|
|-
|
 '''External possession:'''
 (22a) ''Le  médecin    '''leur'''        a examiné    la                 gorge.''
       the  doctor    '''to them'''      examined    SG DEF DET         throat
      'The doctor examined their throats.'

 '''Internal possession:'''
 (22b) ''Le   médecin    a examiné    '''leurs'''        gorges.''
       the  doctor     examined     '''POSS(3PL)'''    throat
      'The doctor examined their throats.'

 (Vergnaud and Zubizarreta 1992: 596 (4b, 6b))
|}

However, those types of possessors are problematic. There is a discrepancy between the possessor appearing syntactically in an inalienable possession construction and what its semantic relationship to the inalienable noun seems to be. Semantically, the possessor of an inalienable noun is intrinsic to its meaning and acts like a [[Argument (linguistics)#Syntactic vs. semantic arguments|semantic argument]]. On the surface syntactic structure, however, the possessor appears in a position that marks it as an argument of the verb.&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt;  Thus, there are different views on how those types of inalienable possession constructions should be represented in the syntactic structure. The binding hypothesis argues that the possessor is an argument of the verb. Conversely, the possessor-raising hypothesis argues that the possessor originates as an argument of the possessed noun and then [[syntactic movement|moves]] to a position in which on the surface, it looks like it is an argument of the verb.&lt;ref name = "Kempchinsky 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempchinsky|first1=Paula|editor1-last=Hirschbühler|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=Koerner|editor2-first=E.F.K.|title=Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages|date=1992|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=90 272 3591 0|pages=135–148|edition=20|chapter=The Spanish possessive dative construction: θ-role assignment and proper government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Binding hypothesis (Guéron 1983)====
The binding hypothesis reconciles the fact that the possessor appears both as a syntactic and semantic argument of the verb but as a semantic argument of the possessed noun. It assumes that inalienable possession constructions are subject to the following syntactic constraints:&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt;
{|
|-
|
 a. There must be an obligatory possessor.
 b. The possessor must be in the same minimal [[locality (linguistics)#Domain|domain]] of the possessee.
 c. The possessor must [[c-command]] the possessee or its [[trace (linguistics)|trace]]
     (The c-command must occur in the underlying or [[Transformational grammar#Deep structure and surface structure|surface structures]] of the inalienable possession constructions.
|}
[[File:Binding between possessor and possessee.PNG|thumb|300px|'''Inalienable possession binding:''': the possessor c-commands the possessee in its domain. The possessor and possessee constitute a lexical chain and receive the same theta-roles from the verb.]]
It is assumed that inalienable possession constructions are one form of [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric binding]]: [[control (linguistics)|obligatory control]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion2"/&gt; Thus, the possessor DP originates in the [[specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] of the verb; the fact that the possessor seems to be a semantic argument of the noun arises from the binding relationship between the possessor and possessee DPs. The parallel between inalienable possession constructions and obligatory control can be seen in the examples below:&lt;ref name=Nakamoto/&gt;
{|
|-
|
 '''Inalienable possession'''
 (23a) ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; lève  la&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;  main''
       Jean  raise the hand
      'Jean raises his hand.'

 '''Obligatory control'''
 (23b) ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; veut  PRO&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;   partir''
       Jean  want (Jean)  to leave
       'Jean wants to leave'

 (Nakamoto 2010: 80 (30a,b))
|}

That hypothesis accounts for differences between French and English, and it may also eliminate the ambiguity created by definite determiners.&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion2"/&gt; According to this hypothesis, anaphoric binding in inalienable possession constructions relates to the [[theta-role|theta-features]] that a language assigns to its determiners.&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt; Thay hypothesis predicts that inalienable possession constructions exist in languages that assign variable theta-features to its determiners and that inalienable possession constructions do not exist in languages that lack variable theta-feature assignment.&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt; Therefore, inalienable possession is predicted to exist in [[Romance languages]] and even [[Russian language|Russian]] but not in languages like [[English language|English]] or [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt; In the French sentence ''Il lève les mains'', the determiner ''les'' is assigned theta-features. Thus, it is understood as inalienable possession. However, in the English translation, the determiner ''the'' does not have theta-features because English is considered does not assign theta-features to its determiners. Therefore, ''the'' does not necessarily signify inalienable possession and so ambiguity surfaces.

That hypothesis, however, does not account for verbs allowing [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] anaphora (''Jean '''se''''' lave 'Jean washes himself').&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt;  To account for the grammaticality of such verbs, Guéron proposes that in an inalienable construction the '''POSS DP''' (possessor DP) and '''BP DP''' (body part DP) constitute two links of a [[lexical chain]], in addition to their anaphoric relation.&lt;ref name="Blackwell Companion"/&gt; The two links of a lexical chain must obey the same constraints as anaphora, which accounts for the locality restrictions on inalienable construals. Every chain is then associated with one theta-role. Inalienable possession surfaces as ungrammatical when the possessed DP and the possessor DP are assigned two different theta-roles by the verb. That explains why sentence (24b) is ungrammatical. The POSS DP is assigned an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] theta-role, anf the BP DP is assigned a [[thematic relation|theme]] theta-role.

====Possessor-raising hypothesis (Landau 1999)====
[[File:Tree diagram of possessor-raising, movement from SpecDP to SpecVP.jpeg|thumbnail|'''Possessor-raising''' from SpecDP to SpecVP]]

Possessor-raising is a syntactic hypothesis that attempts to explain the structures of inalienable [[determiner phrase|DPs]]. Landau argues that the possessor is initially introduced in the specifier position of DP (Spec-DP), but it later raises to the specifier of the [[verb phrase|VP]]. The possessor DP gets its [[theta-role]] from the [[head (linguistics)|head]] D, and that gives rise to the meaning that the possessor is related to the possessee.&lt;ref name='Landau 1999'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landau|first1=Idan|title=Possessor Raising and the Structure of VP|journal=Lingua|date=1999|volume=107|issue=1|pages=1–37|doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(98)00025-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Landau's analysis is made on the basis of several properties possessives in the data case in [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref name=Nakamoto/&gt;
{|
|-
|
 a. The possessor dative must be interpreted as a possessor, not an object/theme.
 b. Possession interpretation is obligatory.
 c. The possessed DP cannot be an external argument.
 d. The possessor dative must c-command the possessed DP (or its trace).
 e. Possessive interpretation is constrained by locality.

 (Nakamoto 2010: 76)
|}

[[File:French example of possessor-raising.jpg|thumb|Illustration of possessor-raising in French. Sentence adapted from (Guéron 2007: 611 (100b)]]
The French data below illustrate how that is thought to work. The possessor ''lui'' originates in the specifier of DP as an argument of the noun ''figure''. That is equivalent to an underlying structure ''Gilles a lavé '''lui''' la figure.'' The possessor raises to the specifier of VP, which is seen in the surface structure ''Gilles '''lui''' a lavé la figure.''

{|
|-
|
 (25) ''Gilles lui      a lavé        la  figure''
      Gilles him.DAT  washed        the face
      [TP Gilles [VP '''lui&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' a lavé [DP '''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' la figure]]]
      'Gilles washed his face'

 (Guéron 2007: 611 (100b))
|}

According to Guéron, a benefit of the hypothesis is that it is consistent with principles of [[syntactic movement]] such as locality of selection and [[c-command]]. If the position to which it needs to move is already filled, as with a [[transitive verb|transitive]] verb like ''see'', the possessor cannot raise, and the sentence is correctly predicted to be ungrammatical.&lt;ref name = "Blackwell Companion"/&gt;

{|
|-
|
 '''Hebrew'''
 (26) ''*Gil ra'a le-Rina et  ha-punim''
       Gil saw  to Rina the face
       [TP '''Gil&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' [VP '''t&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' ra'a [DP le-Rina et ha panim]]]
           NOM                  *DAT          ACC
       'Gil saw Rina's face'

 (Guéron 2007: 613 (109))
|}

However, some languages such as Russian do not have to raise the DP possessor and can leave it ''[[in situ]]'', making it unclear why the possessor would ever have to raise.&lt;ref name = "Blackwell Companion"/&gt; Possessor-raising also violates a [[Syntactic movement#Islands and barriers to movement|constraint on syntactic movement]], the '''specificity constraint''': an element cannot be moved out of a DP if that DP is [[Specificity (linguistics)|specific]].&lt;ref name = "Blackwell Companion"/&gt; In (23), the DP ''lui'' is specific, yet possessor-raising predicts it can be moved out of the larger DP ''lui la figure''. Such movement is excluded by the specificity constraint.

===Form function motivations===
Inalienable possession constructions often lack overt possessors.&lt;ref name=Haspelmath/&gt; There is a debate as to how to account for the [[linguistic universal|linguistically-universal]] difference in form. Iconicity explains the in terms of the relationship between the conceptual distance between the possessor and possessee,&lt;ref name=Haiman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haiman|first1=John|title=Iconic and Economic Motivation|journal=Language|date=1983|volume=59|issue=4|doi=10.2307/413373|pages=781|jstor=413373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economy explains it by the frequency of possession.&lt;ref name="Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Johanna|chapter=On Alienable and Inalienable Possession|title=In Honor of Mary Haas|date=1988|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co|location=Berlin|pages=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iconic motivation (Haiman 1983)====
Haiman describes iconic expression and conceptual distance and how both concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect each other and cannot be separated from each other.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt; [[Joseph Greenberg]] hypothesizes that the distance between the possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession is greater than in a sentence with inalienable constructions.&lt;ref name=Heine3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenberg|first1=Joseph|title=Universals of Human Language|date=1966|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect thay and there is little distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would, in turn, increase their conceptual independence.

That is demonstrated in [[Yagaria language|Yagaria]], a [[Papuan language]]. It marks alienable possession by a free form pronoun as in (27a). In contrast, inalienable possession constructions use an inalienable possessor [[prefix]]ed on the possessee, as in (27b). That construction has less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee than in the alienable construction:
{|
|-
|
 '''Alienable'''
 (27a) ''dgai' fu''
       my    pig
      'my pig'

 '''Inalienable'''
 (27b) ''d-za'''
       my-arm
      'my arm'

   (Haiman 1983: 793 (30a,b))
|}

However, there are cases of linguistic distance not necessarily reflecting conceptual distance. In [[Mandarin Chinese]], there are two ways to express the same type of possession, POSSESSOR + POSSESSEE and POSSESSOR + de + POSSESSEE; the latter has more linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee, but it reflects the same conceptual distance.&lt;ref name=hsu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsu|first1=Yu-Yin|title=Possessor extraction in Mandarin Chinese|journal=University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics|date=2009|volume=15|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both possessive expressions, with and without the marker '''''de''''', are found in the Mandarin phrase "my friend", seen in (28a) compared to (28b):&lt;ref name="Li and Thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Charles|last2=Thompson|first2=Sandra|title=Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
|
 '''POSSESSOR + de + POSSESSEE'''
 (28a) ''wǒ '''DE''' péngyǒu''
       I  '''DE''' friend
      'My    friend'

 '''POSSESSOR + POSSESSEE'''
 (28b) ''wǒ péngyǒu''
       I  friend
      'My friend'

 (Hsu 2009: 101 (22a,b))
|}

In contrast to the previous example, the omission of the marker ''de'' is ungrammatical, as in example (29b). The linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee is much smaller in (29b) than in (29a). It has been argued that the omission of ''de'' occurs only in kinship relationships, but phrasal constructions with a mandatory ''de'' encompasses other inalienable possession examples, such as body parts.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|783}} That contradicts the notion that inalienable possession is marked by less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee.
{|
|-
|
 (29a) ''wǒ xǐhuān nǐ  '''DE''' tóufà''
       I  like   you '''DE''' hair
      'I  like   your   hair'

 (29b) ''*wǒ xǐhuān nǐ   tóufà''
        I  like   you  hair
       'I  like   your hair'

 (Li &amp; Thompson 1981: 169)
|}

====Economic motivation (Nichols 1988)====
Nichols notes that frequently-possessed nouns, such as body parts and kinship terms, almost always occur with possessors, and alienable nouns occur with possessors less often.&lt;ref name="Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Good&gt;{{cite book|last1=Good|first1=Jeff ed.|title=Linguistic Universals and Language Change|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following shows the frequency of possession between alienable and unalienable nouns in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt; The table below shows the number of times each noun occurred with or without a possessor in texts from the German Goethe-Corpus, the works by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Noun category !! Noun !! Unpossessed !! Possessed
|-
| Alienable || ''Gärtner''   'gardener' &lt;br&gt; ''Jäger''   'hunter' &lt;br&gt; ''Pfarrer''   'priest' || 24 &lt;br&gt; 48 &lt;br&gt; 12  || 0 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 0
|-
| Inalienable || ''Schwester''   'sister' &lt;br&gt; ''Tante''   'aunt' &lt;br&gt; ''Tochter''   'daughter' || 32 &lt;br&gt; 47 &lt;br&gt; 46 || 58 &lt;br&gt; 22 &lt;br&gt; 53
|}

The alienable nouns above are rarely possessed, but the inalienable kinship terms are frequently possessed.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt; Consequently, inalienable nouns are expected to be possessed even if they lack a distinct possessive marker. Therefore, overt markings on inalienable nouns are redundant, and to employ economical syntactic construction, languages often zero-mark their inalienable nouns.&lt;ref name="Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co"/&gt;

That could be explained by [[Zipf's Law]] in which the familiarity or the frequency of an occurrence motivates the linguistic simplification of the concept.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt; A listener who hears an inalienable noun can predict that it will be possessed, thereby eliminating the need for an overt possessor.&lt;ref name=Haspelmath/&gt;

=== Austronesian Languages ===
==== Rapa ====
Old [[Rapa language|Rapa]] is the indigenous language of [[Rapa Iti]], an island of French Polynesia located within its Bass Islands archipelago. Within the language structure of Rapa are two primary possessive particles, a and o. The usage of the two particles is dependent on the relation between the possessor and the object. When words of the language are categorized by possessive particles, there is a very close resemblance to the usage of the possessive particle and the object's alienability. However, this relation is better defined by William Wilson in his article ''Proto-Polynesian Possessive Marking''.

Briefly, through his two theories, the Simple Control Theory and Initial Control Theory, Wilson can contrast and thus better define the usage of the possessive particles, a and o. The Simple Control Theory speculates that the determining factor directly correlated to the possessor’s control over the object; emphasizing a dominant vs. less-dominant relationship. Old Rapa adheres closer to the latter of Wilson's two theories, the Initial Control Theory, which speculates that "the possessor's control over the initiation of the possessive relationship is the determining factor." Here, his Initial Control Theory can also be generally expanded to the whole Polynesian language family in terms of better describing the "alienability" of possession.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WILSON, WILLIAM H. 1982. Proto-Polynesian possessive marking. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Old Rapa, the possession particle, o, is used to define a possession relationship that was not initiated on the basis of choice. The possession particle, a, is defines possession relationships that are initiated through the possessor's control. The following list and classifications are literal examples provided by Mary Walworth, in her dissertation of the Rapa language. Words that are marked with the o possessive markers are nouns that are:

However, Wilson's theory does fall short in properly categorizing a few miscellaneous items such as articles of clothing and furniture that his theory would incorrectly predict to be marked with an a-possessive particle. The reverse would occur forobjects such as food and animals. The synthesis of Wilson's theory and other approach a better understanding of the Rapa language. Svenja Völkel proposed the idea of looking further into the ritualistic beliefs of the community, namely their mana. That idea has been relatable to other languages in the Eastern Polynesian language family, and it states that objects that possess less mana than the possessor are indicated with the a-possessive particle, and the usage of the o-possessive marker is reserved for the possessor’s mana not being superior.&lt;ref&gt;Vökel, Svenja. 2010. ''Structure, space, and possession in Tongan culture and language: An ethnolinguistic study''. John Benjamins Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same usage of the possessive particles, a and o, in possessive pronouns can be seen in the contracted portmanteau, the combination of the articles and possessive markers. The resultants are the tō and tā prefixes in the following possessive pronouns, as can be seen in the table below:

=== Wuvulu ===
[[Wuvulu-Aua language|Wuvulu language]] is a small language spoken in [[Wuvulu Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Introduction|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct possession has a close relationship with inalienability in the Oceanic linguistics. Similarly, the inherent possession of the possessor is called the possessum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Possession|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=59–60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inalienable noun also has a possessor suffix and includes body parts, kin terms, locative part nouns, and derived nouns. According to Hafford's research, "-u" (my), "-mu" (your) and "na-"（his/her/its) are three direct possession suffix in Wuvulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Possessor Suffixes|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=61|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Body parts 
Direct- possession suffix "-u"(my), "-mu" (your) and "na-"（his/her/its) can be taken to attach the noun phrase of body part.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Direct possession|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=|via=61-63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Varun Blake is an Indian-born Atlanta police detective that is deeply affected by various incidents in his life like the loss of his biological family in India, the move to a predominantly white school in The States, and the death of his partner. He develops into a temperamental and disturbed man, forcing his Indian wife, Roshni to divorce him and move out of their home with their daughter. Varun then gets into a complicated rebound relationship with a local news reporter, Kate. After gaining American citizenship, Roshni gets a job at a newly outsourced Indian company based in Atlanta called InfoTech. She soon discovers that the company's young but successful director is her childhood friend, Krish Hebbar. The two start seeing each other outside the office, much to Varun's dismay since he still has feelings for his ex-wife. Things take a turn for the worse when several Indian-born young men working for outsourced companies have been found murdered by a professional serial killer. The only link is that all the murder victims knew Krish. Varun brings him in for questioning but does not have enough evidence to arrest him. At around the same time, Krish's true colours are revealed when he blackmails his boss into giving him a promotion. On the dinner date night Roshni comes across a few pictures of the girl whom Krish had forced to go into the cabin of his boss. Seeing this Roshni confronts Krish and tells him that she does not hold any trust on him anymore. Krish tries explaining but couldn't  and his plan to propose her remains unfulfilled.
After more investigation, Varun learns that the real murderer is a former soldier who was fired from several jobs who were then taken by Indian immigrants. The soldier comes for Krish, who took over his job several years ago.He is finally saved by Varun. In the end, Krish marries Roshni and they move back to India to work for the Indian branch of their company to be closer to family.

{{Transgender sidebar}}

'''''Kathoey''''' or '''''katoey''''' ({{lang-th|กะเทย}}; {{RTGS|''Kathoei''}} {{IPA-th|kàtʰɤːj}}) is a [[transgender]] woman or an [[effeminate]] gay male in [[Thailand]]. Transgender women in Thailand mostly use terms other than kathoey when referring to themselves, such as ''phuying'' (Thai: ผู้หญิง "women"). A significant number of [[Thai people]] perceive kathoey as belonging to a [[third gender]], including some trans women themselves.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;Winter, Sam (2003).

Most transgender women in Thai society refer to themselves as ''phuying'' (Thai: ผู้หญิง "women"), with a minority referring to themselves as ''phuying praphet song'' (a "second kind of woman") and only very few referring to themselves as ''kathoey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thai Transgenders in Focus: Demographics, Transitions and Identities|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J485v09n01_03|journal = International Journal of Transgenderism|date = 2006-06-14|issn = 1553-2739|pages = 15–27|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1300/J485v09n01_03|first1=Sam|last1 = Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related phrases include ''phet thi sam'' ({{lang-th|เพศที่สาม}}, "third gender"), and ''sao praphet song'' or ''phu ying praphet song'' ({{lang-th|สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง}}—both meaning "second-type female"). The word ''kathoey'' is of [[Khmer language|Khmer]] origin.&lt;ref name="Peter Jackson-1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter A|title=Male Homosexuality in Thailand; An Interpretation of Contemporary Thai Sources|date=1989|publisher=Global Academic Publishers|location=Elmhurst NY|ref=Peter Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often rendered as "ladyboy" or "lady boy" in English conversation with Thais, an expression that has become popular across [[Southeast Asia]].

== General description ==
Although ''kathoey'' is often translated as "[[transgender]]" in the English usage, this term is not used frequently in Thailand. As well as trans individuals, the term can refer to [[gay men]], and was originally used to refer to [[intersex]] individuals.&lt;ref name="Peter Jackson-1989" /&gt; Before the 1960s, the use of kathoey included anyone who deviated from the dominant and sexual norms.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; Because of this confusion in translation, the [[English language|English]] translation of ''kathoey'' is usually "ladyboy" (or variants of the term).

Use of the term "''kathoey''" suggests that the person [[gender identity|self-identifies as a type of male]], in contrast to ''sao praphet song'' (which, like "trans woman", suggests a "female" (''sao'') gender identity), and in contrast to ''phet thi sam'' (which means "[[third gender]]"). The term ''phu ying praphet song'', which can be translated as "second-type female", is also used to refer to ''kathoey''.&lt;ref name="Peter Jackson-1999"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lady Boys, Tom Boys, Rent Boys: Male and Female Homosexualities in Contemporary Thailand |last=Jackson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jackson (academic) |year=1999 |publisher=[[Haworth Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G30kIcfc8HMC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137#PPA146,M1 |isbn=0-7890-0656-1 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|146}} Australian scholar of sexual politics in Thailand [[Peter Jackson (academic)|Peter Jackson]] claims that the term ''kathoey'' was used in pre-modern times to refer to [[intersex]] people, and that the usage changed in the mid-20th century to cover [[cross-dressing]] males.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Jackson (academic)|Jackson, Peter]] (2003). [http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue9/jackson.html Performative Genders, Perverse Desires: A Bio-History of Thailand's Same-Sex and Transgender Cultures]. in "Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context," Issue 9, August 2003. See paragraph "The Homosexualisation of Cross-Dressing."&lt;/ref&gt; Kathoey became an iconic symbol of modern Thai culture.&lt;ref name="Sam Winter"&gt;Winter, Sam. Queer Bangkok: Twenty-first Century Markets, Media, and Rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The term can refer to males who exhibit varying degrees of femininity. Many dress as women and undergo "feminising" medical procedures such as [[breast implant]]s, [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormones]], [[silicone]] injections, or [[Chondrolaryngoplasty|Adam's apple reductions]]. Others may wear makeup and use feminine [[pronouns]], [[transvestism|but dress as men]], and are closer to the Western category of [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] gay man than transgender.

The term "''kathoey''" may be considered pejorative, especially in the form "''kathoey-saloey''". It has a meaning similar to the English language "fairy" or "queen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpamedia.com/culture/thailand_kathoey/ CPAmedia.com: Thailand's Women of the Second Kind&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120226190848/http://www.cpamedia.com/culture/thailand_kathoey/ archive])&lt;/ref&gt; "''Kathoey''" can also be seen as a derogatory word for those who self-identify as gay.&lt;ref name="Ojanen" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
Bunmi, a Thai Buddhist author, believes that the origins of homosexuality stems from "lower level spirits" (phi-sang-thewada), a factor that is influenced by one's past life.&lt;ref name="Peter Jackson-1989"/&gt; Buddhists view kathoeys as the marking of an individual who is born with a disability as a direct consequence for their past sins.&lt;ref name="Peter Jackson-1989"/&gt;

== Requirements to confirm eligibility for gender reassignment surgery ==

Patients must be at least 18 years old and permission from parents if under 20 years old.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Debbie 2017"&gt;Duncan, Debbie. "Prerequisites - The Transgender Center." ''Prerequisites - The Transgender Center''. N.p., n.d.

Before going through gender reassignment surgery, one must be on hormones/antiandrogens for at least one year.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Debbie 2017"/&gt; Patients must have a note from the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. Two months prior to the surgery, patients are required to see a psychiatrist in Thailand to confirm eligibility for sex reassignment surgery.

== Social context ==
Many ''kathoey'' work in predominately female occupations, such as in shops, restaurants, and [[beauty salon]]s, but also in factories (a reflection of Thailand's high proportion of female industrial workers).&lt;ref name="SwinterNsak"&gt;Winter S, Udomsak N (2002). [http://www.symposion.com/ijt/ijtvo06no01_04.htm Male, Female and Transgender: Stereotypes and Self in Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228130914/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/ijtvo06no01_04.htm |date=28 February 2007 }}. ''International Journal of Transgenderism''. 6,1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kathoey'' also work in entertainment and tourist centers, in [[cabaret]]s, and as [[prostitution|sex workers]]. ''Kathoey'' sex workers have high rates of HIV.&lt;ref name="Tooru Nemoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemoto|first=Tooru|date=|year=2012|title=HIV-Related Risk Behaviors among Kathoey (Male-to-Female Transgender) Sex Workers in Bangkok, Thailand|url=|journal=AIDS Care|volume=24|issue=2|pages=210–9|doi=10.1080/09540121.2011.597709|pmc=3242825|pmid=21780964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kathoy1649.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pattaya]]: ''Kathoey''s on the stage of a [[cabaret]] show]]

''Kathoeys'' are more visible and more accepted in Thai culture than [[transgender]] people are in other countries in the world. Several popular Thai models, singers and movie stars are ''kathoey''s, and Thai newspapers often print [[photograph]]s of the winners of female and ''kathoey'' beauty contests side by side. The phenomenon is not restricted to urban areas; there are ''kathoey''s in most villages, and ''kathoey'' beauty contests are commonly held as part of local fairs.

Using the notion of [[karma]], some Thai believe that being a ''kathoey'' is the result of transgressions in [[reincarnation|past lives]], concluding that ''kathoey'' deserve pity rather than blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Totman| first = Richard | title = The Third Sex: Kathoey: Thailand's Ladyboys |publisher=Souvenir Press | year = 2003 | location = London | page = 57  | isbn = 0-285-63668-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common stereotype is that older, well-off ''kathoey'' [[Sugar daddy (slang term)|provide financial support]] to [[gigolo|young men]] with whom they are in a personal relationship.&lt;ref name=encycl&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/thailand.html Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729232531/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/thailand.html |date=29 July 2008 }}, in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Sexuality]]'', Volume I–IV 1997–2001, edited by [[Robert T. Francoeur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kathoey''s currently face many social and legal impediments. Families (and especially fathers) are typically disappointed if a child becomes a ''kathoey'', and ''kathoey''s often have to face the prospect of [[coming out]]. However, ''kathoey'' generally have greater acceptance in Thailand than most other Asian countries.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roderick|first1=Daffyd|title=Boys Will Be Girls: In a Bangkok clinic, $1,000 can turn a man into a woman.

Findings, Controversies, and Perspectives.'' De Gruyter, Berlin and Boston 2016, pp. 219-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal recognition of ''kathoey''s and transgender individuals is non-existent in Thailand: even if trans people have had genital reassignment surgery, they are not allowed to change their legal sex. Discrimination in employment also remains rampant.&lt;ref name=bkpost&gt;Are you man enough to be a woman? ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', 1 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can also arise in regards to access to amenities and gender allocation; for example, a ''kathoey'' and a transgender person who has undergone [[sexual reassignment surgery]] would still have to stay in an all-male prison.

== Performance ==

=== Representation in cinema ===
Kathoeys began to gain prominence in the [[cinema of Thailand]] during the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ünaldim Serhat" /&gt; The depiction at first was negative by showing kathoeys suffering from bad karma, suicide, and abandoned by straight lovers.&lt;ref name="Ünaldim Serhat"&gt;Ünaldim Serhat.

== Recent developments ==
[[File:Kathoey.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Kathoey'' working in a go-go bar in [[Bangkok]]'s [[Nana Plaza]] entertainment area]]

In 1993, Thailand's teacher training colleges implemented a semi-formal ban on allowing homosexual (which included ''kathoey'') students enrolling in courses leading to qualification for positions in kindergartens and primary schools. In January 1997, the [[Rajabhat University system|Rajabhat Institutes]] (the governing body of the colleges) announced it would formalize the ban, which would extend to all campuses at the start of the 1997 academic year. The ban was quietly rescinded later in the year, following the replacement of the Minister of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lady Boys, Tom Boys, Rent Boys: Male and Female Homosexualities in Contemporary Thailand |last=Jackson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jackson (academic) |year=1999 |publisher=[[Haworth Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G30kIcfc8HMC |isbn=0-7890-0656-1 |pages=xv-xiv |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a volleyball team composed mostly of gays and ''kathoey''s, known as ''The Iron Ladies'' ({{lang-th|สตรีเหล็ก}}, ''satree lek''), later [[The Iron Ladies (film)|portrayed in two Thai movies]], won the Thai national championship. The Thai government, concerned with the country's image, barred two of the ''kathoey''s from joining the national team and competing internationally.

Among the most famous ''kathoey''s in Thailand is [[Parinya Kiatbusaba|Nong Tum]], a former champion [[Muay Thai|Thai boxer]] who emerged into the public eye in 1998. She would present in a feminine manner and had commenced hormone therapy while still a popular boxer; she would enter the ring with long hair and makeup, occasionally kissing a defeated opponent. She announced her retirement from professional boxing in 1999&amp;nbsp;– undergoing genital reassignment surgery, while continuing to work as a coach, and taking up acting and modeling. She returned to boxing in 2006.

In 2004, the Chiang Mai Technology School allocated a separate restroom for ''kathoey''s, with an intertwined male and female symbol on the door. The 15 ''kathoey'' students are required to wear male clothing at school but are allowed to sport feminine hairdos. The restroom features four stalls, but no urinals.&lt;ref&gt;"Transvestites Get Their Own School Bathroom", [[Associated Press]], 22 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état]], ''kathoey''s are hoping for a new third sex to be added to passports and other official documents in a proposed new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&amp;subID=1805 "Thailand's 'third sex' seeks legal recognition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523060201/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&amp;subID=1805 |date=23 May 2007 }}. ''The First Post''. 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, legislative efforts have begun to allow ''kathoey''s to change their legal sex if they have undergone genital reassignment surgery; this latter restriction was controversially discussed in the community.&lt;ref name=bkpost/&gt;

[[Bell Nuntita]], a contestant of ''[[Thailand's Got Talent]]'' TV shows, became a [[YouTube]] hit when she first performed singing as a girl and then switched to a masculine voice.&lt;ref name=GlobalPostThaiKathoeySinger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=UPDATED: Thai transgender talent show shocker = YouTube gold|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-rice-bowl/thai-transgender-talent-show-shocker-youtube-gold|accessdate=22 March 2015|publisher=''[[globalpost]]''|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that as many as six in every thousand individuals assigned as male at birth later present themselves as transwomen or phu-ying kham-phet.&lt;ref name="Sam Winter" /&gt;

== Advocacy  ==

=== Activism   ===

Activism in Thailand is discouraged if it interferes with official policy.&lt;ref name="Liz Cameron"&gt;Cameron, Liz. "Sexual Health and Rights Sex Workers, Transgender People &amp; Men Who have Sex with Men." ''OPEN SOCIETY INSTITUTE Public Health Program''(2006): n. pag.

Social spaces are often limited for kathoeys even if Thai society does not actively persecute them.&lt;ref name="Ojanen" /&gt; Indigenous cultural traditions have given a social space for gender-diverse individuals of Thailand.&lt;ref name="Sam Winter" /&gt; In January 2015, Thailand announced it would recognize the third gender in its constitution in order to ensure all genders be treated equally under the law.&lt;ref name="Isobel Yeung" /&gt;

=== Privacy issues ===
Identity cards are particularly important in Thailand. The vast majority of trans people in the country were unable to change their documents at all, and those who are able to were held to rather severe standards.&lt;ref name="Armbrecht-2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armbrecht|first1=Jason|title=Transsexuals and Thai Law|url=http://www.thailawforum.com/Transsexuals-and-Thai-Law.html|website=Thailand Law Forum|accessdate=23 March 2018|date=11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; IDs facilitate many daily activities such as interface with businesses, bureaucratic agencies (i.e., signing up for educational courses or medical care), law enforcement, etc. Impeded by these identity cards on a daily basis, [[transgender]] individuals are "outed" by society.&lt;ref name="Salvá-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salvá|first1=Ana|title=An LGBTI Oasis?

== In popular culture ==

The first all ''kathoey'' music group in Thailand was formed in 2006. It is named [[Venus Flytrap (group)|Venus Flytrap]] and was selected and promoted by [[Sony BMG]] Music Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?file=/columnists/2007/2/3/thaitakes/16770000&amp;sec=Thai%20Takes "'Katoeys' hit the music scene"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', 3 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lady Boys of Bangkok is a ''kathoey'' [[revue]] that has been performed in the UK since 1998 touring the country in both theatres and the famous "Sabai Pavilion"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ladyboysofbangkok.co.uk/the-sabai-pavilion/|title=The Sabai Pavilion {{!}} The Lady Boys of Bangkok|newspaper=The Lady Boys of Bangkok|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; for nine months each year.

''[[Ladyboys (film)|Ladyboys]]'', also a popular term used in Thailand when referring to a transgender woman, was the title of a popular documentary in [[the United Kingdom]], where it was aired on [[Channel 4]] TV in 1992 and was directed by [[Jeremy Marre]]. Marre aimed to portray the life of two teenage kathoeys living in the rural part of Thailand, as they strived to land a job at a cabaret revue located in the popular city known as [[Pattaya]].

The German-Swedish band [[Lindemann (band)|Lindemann]] wrote the song "Ladyboy", on their first studio album ''[[Skills in Pills]]'', about a man's preference of kathoeys.

In the TV series ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'', the protagonist regularly mentions ladyboys, seemingly expressing a sexual interest in them.

Thai kathoey style and fashion has largely borrowed from Korean pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackwood|first1=Evelyn|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark|title=Queer Asian Subjects: Transgressive Sexualities and Heteronormative Meanings|journal=Asian Studies Review|date=2012|volume=36|issue=4|pages=441–451|doi=10.1080/10357823.2012.741037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Uncle Go Paknam" ===
"Uncle Go Paknam", created by Pratchaya Phanthathorn, is a popular gay and lesbian advice column that first appeared in 1975 in a magazine titled ''Plaek'', meaning "strange."&lt;ref name="Uncle Go"&gt;Jackson, Peter A. ''First Queer Voices from Thailand: Uncle Go's Advice Columns for Gays, Lesbians and Kathoeys''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2016. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Through letters and responses it became an outlet to express the desires and necessities of the LGBT community in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; The magazine achieved national popularity because of its bizarre and often queer content.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; It portrayed positive accounts of kathoeys and men called "sharks" to view transgender people as legitimate or even preferred sexual partners and started queer-accepting public discourse in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; Under the pen name of Phan Thathron he wrote the column "Girls to the Power of 2"  that included profiles of kathoeys in a glamorous or provocative pose.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; "Girls to the Power of 2" were the first accounts of kathoey lives based on interviews that allowed their voices to be published in the national mainstream press of Thailand.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; The heterosexual public became more inclined to read about new transgender communities that were previously given negative press in Thai newspapers.&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt; Go Paknam's philosophy was "kathoeys are good (for men)."&lt;ref name="Uncle Go" /&gt;

=== ''Inside Thailand's Third Gender'' ===
A documentary entitled ''Inside Thailand's Third Gender'' examines the lives of ladyboys in Thailand and features interviews with various transgender women, the obstacles these individuals face with their family and lovers, but moreover on a larger societal aspect where they feel outcast by the religious Thai culture. Following contestants participating in one of the largest [[transgender]] beauty pageants, known as [[Miss Tiffany's Universe]], the film not only illustrates the process and competitiveness that takes place during the beauty pageant, but also highlights the systems of oppression that take place to target the transgender community in Thailand.

'''Kenneth Goodman''' (born December 23, 1927) is Professor Emeritus, Language Reading and Culture, at the University of Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kgoodman/ken.html|title=Kenneth S. Goodman|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for developing the theory underlying the literacy philosophy of [[whole language]].

== Biography ==
After publishing an influential book on the subject, Goodman began to create a psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic model of reading inspired by the work of [[Noam Chomsky]]. Goodman decided that the process of reading was similar to the process of learning a language as conceptualized by Chomsky, and that literacy developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with print, just as language ability developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with language. Goodman concluded that attempts to teach rules ("[[phonics]]") to children for decoding words were inappropriate and not likely to succeed.

After developing and researching the Whole Language model, Goodman presented his work to the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA) conference and published an article in the ''Journal of the Reading Specialist,'' in which he famously wrote that reading is a "[[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] guessing game." He retired from the [[University of Arizona]] in August 1998.

== Theory ==
Goodman's concept of written language development views it as parallel to oral language development. Goodman's theory was a basis for the [[whole language]] movement, which was further developed by [[Yetta Goodman]], [[Regie Routman]], [[Frank Smith (psycholinguist)|Frank Smith]] and others. His concept of reading as an analogue to language development has been studied by brain researchers such as Sally Shaywitz, who rejected the theory on the grounds that reading does not develop naturally in the absence of instruction. Despite this, the theory continues to receive support from some scholars. Goodman's theory and strong convictions made him an icon of the whole language movement and a lightning rod for criticism from those who disgree with it. His book ''What's Whole in Whole Language'' sold over 250,000 copies in six languages.

== Achievements ==
Goodman is a controversial figure in the education community. He has served in several important capacities, including as President of the [[International Reading Association]], President of the National Conference on Research in Language and Literacy, and President of the Center for Expansion of Language and Thinking. He also worked extensively with the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]. He received a number of awards, including the James Squire award from NCTE for contributions to the profession and NCTE (2007). Goodman has published over 150 articles and book chapters as well as a number of books. In addition to ''What's Whole in Whole Language'', he also wrote ''Ken Goodman on Reading'' and ''Phonics Phacts''; all were published by Heinemann.  His latest book is ''Scientific Realism in Studies of Education'', which was published by Taylor and Francis in 2007.

The '''Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies''' is an interfaculty interdisciplinary research centre of the Humanities and Social Sciences at [[KU Leuven]], Belgium. It carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, and has been recognized as a KU Leuven Centre of Excellence.

== History and Research ==
The Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, with a particular focus on the following areas, taking the many cross-cutting issues into account: (i) the European Union and global governance, (ii) human rights, democracy and rule of law, (iii) trade and sustainable development, (iv) peace and security, (v) emerging powers, (vi) federalism and multi-level governance, (vii) global commons and outer space, and (viii) non-state actors.

In full recognition of the complex issues involved, the Centre approaches global governance from a multilevel and multi-actor perspective. The Centre considers non-European perspectives to global governance of great importance. It also hosts the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/eu_china_chair|title=– InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; which engages in interdisciplinary research and education on EU-China relations in close synergy with the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair at the Université catholique de Louvain, and the Leuven India Focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/india_focus|title=– Leuven India Focus|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which aims at developing knowledge and expertise on India and South Asia by organizing conferences, lectures and seminars and interdisciplinary research. The Centre regularly organizes transatlantic conferences and events focusing on Latin America and Asia, and takes a keen interest in the Global South.

In addition to its fundamental research, the Centre carries out independent applied research and advises policy-makers on multilateral governance and global public policy issues. It works with academic and policy partners from all over the world, including the [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], [[European External Action Service]], [[Committee of the Regions]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[World Bank]] and [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The Centre publishes the Leuven Global Governance Series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-elgar.com/search_results.lasso?series_title=Leuven%20Global%20Governance%20series&amp;series_search=Yes&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Edward Elgar Publishing|Edward Elgar Publishers]], makes it research available through academic journal articles, working papers, policy briefs and global governance opinions on its web site and regularly publishes a newsletter.

Since March 2011, the Centre is located in the historical house de Dorlodot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/contact.html|title=Contact Information|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the Centre of Leuven. The house is named after {{ill|Henry de Dorlodot|nl}}, a Belgian theologian and paleontologist (1855–1929).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12710">{{about|the linguistic concept}}

A '''lexicon''', '''word-hoard''', '''wordbook''', or '''word-stock''' is the [[vocabulary]] of a person, [[language]], or branch of [[knowledge]] (such as [[nautical]] or [[medical]]).  In [[linguistics]], a '''lexicon''' is a language's inventory of [[lexeme]]s. The word "lexicon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λεξικόν}} (''lexicon''), neuter of {{lang|grc|λεξικός}} (''lexikos'') meaning "of or for words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός] in Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Perseus Digital Library). Sc. βιβλίον "book").&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its [[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]); and a [[grammar]], a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include [[bound morpheme]]s, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most [[affix]]es).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OKvziaqXzXwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=morphemes+lexicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CB_0QMidAO&amp;sig=1YiUJnAc0kj-Pbh0V6duJhHPktg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl99OPt_TTAhWK0xoKHUolARo4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=morphemes%20lexicon&amp;f=false|title=Morphological structure, lexical representation, and lexical access|last2=Taft|first2=Marcus|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|last1=Dominiek|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some analyses, [[compound word]]s and certain classes of [[idiom]]atic expressions and other [[collocation]]s are also considered to be part of the lexicon. [[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, [[lexeme]]s are grouped into lemmas. A [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] is a group of lexemes generated by [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional morphology]]. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the [[citation form]]s and any [[English irregular verbs|irregular forms]], since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. [[Part of speech|Closed categories]], such as [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] or [[pronoun]]s, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily [[Syntax|syntactic]]. Open categories, such as [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
{{anchor#Lexicalization}}

A central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established ''lexical norms and conventions''. [[Lexicalization]] is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization&lt;ref name="Geert2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geert |first=Booij |title=The grammar of words : an introduction to linguistic morphology |series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-928042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], are often close semantically. Two examples are ''[[wikt:aptitude|aptitude]]'' versus ''[[wikt:attitude|attitude]]'' and ''[[wikt:employ|employ]]'' versus ''[[wikt:imply|imply]]''.&lt;ref name="Skeat 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRGhnkZq3HQC |date=2010-04-17 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=978-1-4400-5722-9 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornan |first=Uzzi |authorlink=Uzzi Ornan |title=The Final Word — Mechanism For Hebrew Word Generation |year=2003 |publisher=Haifa University Press |location=Haifa |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Allan |title=Predicting New Words — The Secrets of Their Success |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-13006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as ''slang'', ''branding''.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* [[Abbreviation]] of compounds.
* [[Acronyms]], the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as [[wikt:NASA|NASA]] and [[wikt:laser|laser (from "LASER")]].
* [[Inflection]], a morphology change with a category, such as number or tense.
* [[Morphological derivation|Derivation]], a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* [[Agglutination]], the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
[[Neologism]]s are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake.&lt;ref name="Jaeger2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Jeri J. |title=Kid's slips: what young children's slips of the tongue reveal about language development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YGd1FkRgAC |accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-3579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guestword (in German: ''Gastwort''): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: ''Fremdwort''): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: ''Lehnwort''): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using [[Target language (translation)|target language]] lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'', by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phono-semantic matching]] (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves [[Generative grammar|generative]] devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] "-able" is usually only added to [[transitive verb]]s, as in "readable" but not "cryable".

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through [[analogy]], [[Pragmatics|common sense and, most commonly, context]].&lt;ref name="Geert2005" /&gt; Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound.&lt;ref name="Maity2016"&gt;Suman Kalyan Maity, Ritvik Saraf and Animesh Mukherjee (2016). #Bieber + #Blast = #BieberBlast: Early Prediction of Popular Hashtag Compounds. In ''ACM CSCW'', San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. 

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to  shape the lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutscher |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist) |title=The Unfolding of Language: An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention  |date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=Metropolitan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.
* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Phonological assimilation]], the modification of loanwords to fit a new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too "foreign", inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* [[Analogy]], where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Emphasis]], the modification of words' stress or accenting.
* [[Metaphor]], a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
{{main|Bilingual lexical access}}

The term "lexicon" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants ([[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]], for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a ''[[wikt:cash dispenser|cash dispenser]]'' (British English) as well as an  [[wikt:automatic teller machine|automatic teller machine]] or [[wikt:ATM|ATM]] in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/[[concept]] relationship; [[lexical access]] and lexical access failure; how a word's [[phonology]], [[syntax]], and meaning intersect; the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use ([[pragmatics]]); [[language acquisition]]; the history and evolution of words ([[etymology]]); and the relationships between words, often studied within [[philosophy of language]].

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

This is a '''list of cities and towns founded by the Romans'''. It lists every city established and built by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] to have begun as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] often for the settlement of [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] or veterans of the [[Roman legion|legions]]. Many Roman colonies rose to become important commercial and cultural centers, transportation hubs and capitals of global empires. Most [[Europe|European towns]] still retain part of the original Roman street-grid.

'''Meninism''' is term used which has been used to describe various groups, including the [[men's rights movement]], and [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]]. The term is sometimes used sincerely to challenge social issues facing men, and sometimes satirically or semi-satirically as a word-play on [[feminism]]. Members of these groups are known as '''meninists'''.

==History==
The term meninism was used in the early 2000s to describe [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]] who opposed [[sexism]] and supported women's right for equality in [[society]], [[politics]] and at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MENININST: MEN SUPPORTING THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/links/men.htm|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=feminist.com|date=8 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kay|first1=Tom Zatar|title=Out if the Box|date=2003|publisher=Xlibris|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=1-4134-1757-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrick-Jones|first1=Amanda|title=Men who Believe in Feminism|date=2002|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-96822-7|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next decade, the term was used on [[social media]] to make jokes which mocked and criticised [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zand|first1=Benjamin|title=#BBCtrending: Feminism v Meninism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25462758|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daubney|first1=Martin|title=Will 2015 be the year of meninism?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11308455/Will-2015-be-the-year-of-meninism.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[BBC]] reported that the hashtag #MeninistTwitter was being used on [[Twitter]], first to share jokes about [[feminism]], but later to share more serious difficulties facing modern men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; In 2015, Nolan Feeney of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that those who used meninist hashtags "generally fall in two camps: people who use the term to call out ways they believe they’ve been victimised by feminism, and people who make fun of the first group for not understanding what feminism means in the first place".&lt;ref name=time /&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with terms like Meninism

==Meaning==
The term has partially evolved into a movement promoting awareness of the issues which the movement perceives as affecting men, opposition to the perceived oppression men face in the 21st century, opposition to the way some perceive that men are victimised by modern-day feminism, and occasionally violence against men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feeney|first1=Nolan|title=This Is What Happens When You Show Off Your 'Meninist' T-Shirt|url=http://time.com/3673614/meninist-meninism-t-shirts-hashtag/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=TIME|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also identify as meninists.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Alison|title=Women disillusioned with feminism are turning to meninism|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/25/women-disillusioned-with-feminism-are-turning-to-meninism-5265103/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Metro|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Daubney]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', some meninists have used the term to discuss serious issues affecting men, such as [[domestic violence against men]]; [[fathers' rights]] and [[divorce]] issues; and disproportionate male prison sentences, [[suicide]] rates, and rates of homelessness.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; According to Radhika Sanghani of ''The Telegraph'', the hashtag is most commonly used on Twitter to mock feminism, but has also been used as a way to draw attention to men's issues, similar to "The Red Pill" forum on [[Reddit]]. Sanghani says that the movement's reaction to feminism is based more on the label than feminism's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghani|first1=Radhika|title=Feminists v Meninists: The labels we could all afford to ditch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11380282/Feminists-v-Meninists-The-labels-we-could-all-afford-ditch.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abigail James writing for ''Catholic Online'' said that while meninism raises legitimate issues which should be taken seriously, its heart is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Abigail|title=Feminism takes a sharp hit as men fight back with Meninism|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/family/story.php?id=58102|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Catholic Online|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with the Meninist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lin|first=Jie Liang|title=Antifeminism Online: MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way)|date=2017|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1xxrxw.9|work=Digital Environments|pages=77–96|series=Ethnographic Perspectives Across Global Online and Offline Spaces|publisher=Transcript Verlag|isbn=9783837634976|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Mintified, an India-based media website, started the #BlameOneNotAll hashtag to discourage generalisations of men. According to Victoria Richards of ''[[The Independent]]'', the campaign was  part of the meninist movement. The campaign received backlash for shifting focus away from the victims of rape and implying that basic decency should be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Victoria|title='Don't blame all men for rape' campaign backfires spectacularly|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/blameonenotall-the-meninist-rape-campaign-that-spectacularly-backfired-10278297.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for ''[[The Economic Times]]'' Shephali Bhatt criticised the use of the movement and [[International Men's Day]] to sell deodorant, saying "...for an initiative to become a social phenomena, it needs to be rooted in truth. And the truth is that [men are] a sufficiently privileged gender, comparatively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhatt|first1=Shephali|title=How meninism campaigns can explain gender inequality against men better|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-26/news/56490134_1_international-men-harsh-agarwal-feminism|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Economic Times|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hashtags have also been used for T-shirts and similar, with self-portraits of people wearing the clothes widely shared on social media. Several outlets reported that the clothes and images were widely mocked, and often Photoshopped sarcastically.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Rossalyn|title=People Are Wearing Anti-Feminist "Meninist" T-Shirts And The Internet Has Responded Amusingly|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/people-are-wearing-anti-feminist-meninist-t-shirts-and-the-i|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Lucia|title=#Meninist T-Shirts Got a Photoshop Makeover Thanks to Twitter, and It's Glorious|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/59653-meninist-t-shirts-got-a-photoshop-makeover-thanks-to-twitter-and-its-glorious|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Bustle.com]]|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mr. Irrelevant''' is the title bestowed each year upon the last pick of the annual [[National Football League Draft|National Football League draft]]. Although the NFL Draft dates back to 1936, the first person to officially be given the "Mr. Irrelevant" title was [[Kelvin Kirk]], pick number 487 of the [[1976 NFL Draft|1976 draft]]. The current Mr. Irrelevant is [[Trey Quinn]], former wide receiver for the [[SMU Mustangs football]] team, who was picked 256th by the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[2018 NFL Draft|2018 draft]].

==History==
"Mr. Irrelevant" and "Irrelevant Week" arose in 1976, when former [[USC Trojans Football|Southern California]] and NFL receiver [[Paul Salata]] founded the event in [[Newport Beach, California]]. He continued to announce the final pick of the NFL draft until 2013; from 2014 his daughter took over in announcing the pick. During the summer after the draft, the new Mr. Irrelevant and his family are invited to spend a week in Newport Beach where they enjoy a golf tournament, a [[regatta]], a [[roast (comedy)|roast]] giving advice to the new draftee, and a ceremony awarding him the '''Lowsman Trophy'''. The trophy mimics the [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]], but depicts a player [[Fumble|fumbling]] a football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/21474/irrelevant-week-is-pretty-well-relevant|title=Irrelevant Week is pretty, well, relevant|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Irrelevant Week" gave so much publicity to "Mr. Irrelevant" that in [[1979 NFL Draft|1979]] the [[Los Angeles Rams]], with the penultimate pick, intentionally passed to let the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], with the last pick, choose first. The Steelers also wanted the publicity and passed as well. The two teams continued to refuse to choose a player until [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] forced the teams to pick. The incident led to the "Salata Rule", which prohibits teams from passing to get the final pick.&lt;ref name="merron20050418"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=list/050418/draftdays&amp;num=0 | title=The strangest NFL draft moments | publisher=ESPN | date=April 18, 2005 | accessdate=December 18, 2014 | author=Merron, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable "winners"==
Since the NFL draft was cut to its current seven-round format in 1994, players  presented with this dubious honor have more often succeeded in making the team that drafted them, with some making significant contributions on the field.
*[[Special teams]] player [[Marty Moore]] became the first Mr. Irrelevant to play in a [[Super Bowl]], with the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XXXI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nesn.com/2010/03/mr-irrelevant-marty-moore-a-major-success-story-for-patriots/|title=‘Mr. Irrelevant’ Marty Moore a Major Success Story for Patriots|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mike Green (defensive back)|Mike Green]] played a significant role in the [[Chicago Bears]] secondary in the 2000s, and played from 2000 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/national/2013/04/nfl_draft_2013_top_5_mr_irrele.html|title=NFL Draft 2013: Top 5 most relevant Mr. Irrelevant selections of all time|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jim Finn]] was on the roster as a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] for the [[New York Giants]] on their victory in [[Super Bowl XLII]].  Prior to the 2007 season, Finn was placed on injured reserve, and never played a game for the Giants on their road to the Super Bowl that year, having been replaced by [[Madison Hedgecock]].  Prior to 2007, he had been the Giants fullback for four seasons.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/where-are-they-now-catching-up-with-20-different-mr-irrelevant-draft-picks|title=20 NFL draft Mr. Irrelevants who worked their way to (some sort of) relevance|date=April 29, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2008 NFL Draft|2008 winner]] [[David Vobora]] was a starting [[linebacker]] for the [[St. Louis Rams]] during the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]].&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;
*[[2009 NFL Draft|2009 winner]] [[Ryan Succop]] became the starting [[place kicker|kicker]] for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He went on to tie the NFL record for highest field goal percentage by a rookie in a season with 86.2%, and also passed NFL Hall of Famer [[Jan Stenerud]] for most field goals made by a rookie in Chiefs history. Succop was awarded the [[Kansas City Chiefs awards#Mack Lee Hill Award|Mack Lee Hill Award]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kcchiefs.com/news/2010/01/05/rb_jamaal_charles_voted_derrick_thomas_award_winner_k_ryan_succop_wins_mack_lee_hill_award/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113032704/http://kcchiefs.com/news/2010/01/05/rb_jamaal_charles_voted_derrick_thomas_award_winner_k_ryan_succop_wins_mack_lee_hill_award/ |archivedate=January 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; He has been a starting kicker since his rookie season making 81.5% of his field goals and a perfect 100% on extra points. Succop moved on to the [[Tennessee Titans]] for the 2014 season and was signed to a contract extension in early 2018.
*[[2017 NFL Draft|2017 winner]] [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] Quarterback [[Chad Kelly]] is the nephew of former [[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback, and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Jim Kelly]]. Drafted last largely because injury and discipline questions had lowered his previously high draft stock, Kelly progressed to become the [[Denver Broncos]]' second-string quarterback by the 2018 preseason before being released October 24, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000930840/article/john-elway-broncos-not-giving-up-on-paxton-lynch | title=John Elway: Broncos not giving up on Paxton Lynch | website=nfl.com | date=May 1, 2018 | accessdate=May 2, 2018 | author=Wesseling, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One "Mr. Irrelevant" (who actually predated the award by nearly a decade) went on to a productive professional career in another sport. [[Jimmy Walker (basketball, born 1944)|Jimmy Walker]] was the final pick in [[1967 NFL Draft|1967]] despite never having played college football. His main sport, however, was [[basketball]], in which he was a consensus All-American and the nation's leading scorer as a senior at [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence College]]. Walker was the first pick in the [[1967 NBA Draft]], and opted for a career in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/colleges/mens_basketball/articles/2007/07/03/providence_hoops_legend_jimmy_walker_dies_at_63/?p1=MEWell_Pos4 |title=Providence hoops legend Jimmy Walker dies at 63 |first=Peter |last=May |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

'''Oxford Aspire''' is a consortium of the [[Oxford University Museums]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.ox.ac.uk | title=Oxford University Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oxfordshire County Council]] Museums Service.  It was established in April 2012 as one of the 16 Major Partner Museum services nationwide funded by [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordaspiremuseums.org/aspire/about-aspire |title=About ASPIRE &amp;#124; Oxford ASPIRE |publisher=Oxfordaspiremuseums.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; when ACE took over funding for Museums from Museums Libraries and Archives (MLA).

The consortium includes the following museums:
* [[The Ashmolean Museum]]
* [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Museum of the History of Science, University of Oxford]]
* [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]
* [[Pitt Rivers Museum]]
* [[The Oxfordshire Museum]]

As part of their activity Oxford ASPIRE runs a programme of knowledge sharing events for the sector around the themes of Fundraising and Philanthropy, Commercial Enterprise, Managing Museums and Digital.

In March 2015 ASPIRE will be running a new leadership programme for the sector called Oxford Cultural Leaders. This week-long residential for established and emerging cultural sector leaders will be delivered in partnership with the [[Saïd Business School]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17504">[[File:Pedrolino and the Doctor in 1621 woodcut.jpg|thumb|Pedrolino scuffles with the Doctor, 1621.]]

'''Pedrolino''' is a ''primo [[Zanni#Two types of Zanni|zanni]]'', or comic servant, of the ''[[Commedia dell'Arte]]''; the name is a [[hypocorism]] of ''Pedro'' (Peter), via the suffix ''-lino''.  The character made its first appearance in the last quarter of the 16th century, apparently as the invention of the actor with whom the role was to be long identified, Giovanni Pellesini.  Contemporary illustrations suggest that his white blouse and trousers constituted "a variant of the typical ''zanni'' suit",&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Bergamasque dialect]] marked him as a member of the "low" rustic class.&lt;ref&gt;So asserted Bartolomeo Rossi in the foreword to his 1584 pastoral play ''Fiamella'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ow08AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3].  See also Andrews, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  But if his costume and social station were without distinction, his dramatic role was certainly not: as a multifaceted "first" ''zanni'', his character was&amp;mdash;and still is&amp;mdash;rich in comic incongruities.

Many Commedia historians make a connection between the Italian Pedrolino and the later [[Pierrot]] of the French [[Comédie-Italienne]], and, although a link between the two is possible, it remains unproven and seems unlikely, based on the scant evidence of early Italian scenario texts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, pp. xxv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type, plot-function, and character==
Pedrolino appears in forty-nine of the fifty [[scenario]]s of [[Flaminio Scala]]'s ''Il teatro delle favole rappresentative'' (1611) and in three (undated) pieces of the "Corsini" collection of manuscripts;&lt;ref&gt;The Scala scenarios have been translated by Salerno; the plots of the "Corsini" pieces have been summarized by Pandolfi (V, 252-76).  As Storey (1978) notes, at least one of Pandolfi's summaries "gives indication that [Pedrolino] may enjoy here different nuances of character from those of Scala's ''zanni'': in ''Il Granchio'' [The Crab] he appears to be a father on equal footing with Pantalone" (p. 15, n. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; he also appears (as "Pedrolin") in a 1587 scripted comedy by [[Luigi Groto]], ''La Alteria.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k752872|title=La Alteria , comedia di Luigi Groto, cieco d'Hadria. Novamente ricorretta e ristampata|last=Groto|first=Luigi (1541-1585)|date=1612-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these provide evidence of how he was conceived and played.  He is obviously a type of what Robert Storey calls the "social wit", usually incarnated as "the go-between, the willing servant, the wily slave" who "survives in serving others".&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1996), pp. 170, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Scala scenarios, which offer the most revealing showcase of his character, he is invariably cast as the "first" ''zanni'', a type to be distinguished from the "second" ''zanni'' by his or her function in the plot.  The Commedia critic and historian Constant Mic clarifies the distinctions when he notes that the first ''zanni''
&lt;blockquote&gt;instigates confusion quite voluntarily, [but] the second creates disturbance through his blundering.  The second ''zanni'' is a perfect dunce; but the first sometimes gives indication of a certain instruction. ... ''The first'' zanni ''incarnates the dynamic, comic element of the play, the second its static element''.&lt;ref&gt;Mic, p. 47; tr. Storey (1978), p. 13 (emphasis Storey's).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since his function is "to keep the play moving",&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Pedrolino seems to betray, in Storey's words, "a [[Janus]]-faced aspect": "He may work cleverly in the interests of the Lovers in one play&amp;mdash;''Li Quattro finti spiritati'' [The Four Fake Spirits], for example&amp;mdash;by disguising himself as a magician and making Pantalone believe that the 'madness' of Isabella and Oratio can be cured only by their coupling together; then, in ''Gli avvenimenti comici, pastorali e tragici'' [Comic, Pastoral, and Tragic Events], indulge his capricious sense of fun by compounding the young persons' misfortunes."&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  So multiform is his character that his cleverness can often give way to credulity (as when he is tricked into believing that he was drunk when he learned of his wife's infidelity and so merely imagined the whole affair) and his calculation can sometimes be routed by grotesque sentimentality (as when he, [[Arlecchino]], and [[Burratino]] share a bowl of macaroni, the three blubbering all the while).&lt;ref&gt;The parenthetical examples are from two plays in the Scala collection, [https://sites.google.com/site/italiancommedia/plays-and-scenari/la-fortunata-isabella ''La Fortunata Isabella'' (Lucky Isabella)] and ''Il Pedante'' (The Pedant).&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite such inconsistencies in character and behavior, he has (or at least had, for his Renaissance audiences) an "instantly recognizable" identity.  "The recognizability came," as Richard Andrews writes, "from his costume; from his body language; and most of all from his style of speech, which for Italian audiences was based on a regional dialect as well as more personal idiosyncrasies."&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, pp. xix, xx.&lt;/ref&gt;  That recognizability also arose from his puckish love of mischief: "He takes a child-like delight in practical jokes and pranks," as a modern-day practitioner of the Commedia writes, "but otherwise his intrigues are on behalf of his master. ... At times, however, the best he can scheme for is to escape the punishment others have in store for him."&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Naively volatile, he can be moved to violence when angry, but, in obedience to the conventions of comedy, his pugnaciousness is usually deflected or foiled.

Pedrolino is most often presented as having an all-white wardrobe and wearing exaggeratedly over-sized and loose-fitting clothes, typically including a white jacket with large buttons and comically long sleeves, a large neck ruff, and a large, floppy hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pedrolino|title=Pedrolino {{!}} stock theatrical character|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the few unmasked male characters that was not an [[Innamorati]]. Instead of a mask, Pedrolino is said to have been defined, according to some Commedia historians, by a white "floured" makeup, also known as ''infarinato'', which later inspired, in part, the makeup of the modern-day white-faced clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factionoffools.org/history|title=Faction of Fools {{!}} A History of Commedia dell'Arte|website=www.factionoffools.org|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pellesini==
Pedrolino first appears among the records of the Commedia in 1576, when his interpreter Giovanni Pellesini (c. 1526-1616) turns up in Florence, apparently leading his own troupe called ''Pedrolino''.&lt;ref&gt;For the movements of this troupe and of Pellesini himself, see Lea, I, 265-92.&lt;/ref&gt;  A member of some of the most illustrious companies of the 16th and 17th centuries&amp;mdash;the ''Confidenti'', ''Uniti'', ''Fideli'', ''[[I Gelosi|Gelosi]]'', and ''Accessi''&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of these troupes and of Pellesini's movements among them is given by Rudlin and Crick, pp. 1-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;Pellesini was obviously "a much sought-after and highly paid guest star".&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  His status is underscored by the fact that Pedrolino figures so prominently in Scala's scenarios, since, as K.M. Lea convincingly argues, Scala, in compiling them, drew upon the "chief actors of his day ... without regard to the composition of a company at any particular period."&lt;ref&gt;Lea, I, 293.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pedrolino&amp;mdash;and Pellesini&amp;mdash;were, we must conclude, among the brightest luminaries of the early Commedia dell'Arte.

Pellesini had a lengthy run as Pedrolino and performed for a number of high-ranking spectators, including the Duke of Mantua at [[Fontainebleau]] while traveling with the ''Confidenti''.  His last appearance as Pedrolino was in 1613 at the age of eighty-seven, performing with the ''Accessi'' company at the court theater of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin and Crick, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; an engagement to which the poet [[François de Malherbe|Malherbe]] responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Harlequin is certainly quite different from what he was, and so is Petrolin [i.e., Pedrolino]: the first is fifty-six and the second eighty-seven.  These are no longer proper ages for the theater; gay spirits and sharp wits are needed there, and one hardly finds these in bodies as old as theirs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludovic Lalanne]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k52098/f355.image.r=.langEN vol. 3, p. 337], has the original French: "Arlequin est certainement bien différent de ce qu'il a été, et aussi est Petrolin : le premier a cinquante-six ans et le dernier quatre-vingts et sept; ce ne sont plus âges propres au théâtre : il y faut des humeurs gaies et des esprits délibérés, ce qui ne se trouve guère en de si vieux corps comme les leurs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pedrolino and Pierrot==
Since the names of the two types translate into the same diminutive ("Little Pete") and they enjoy (or suffer) the same dramatic and social status, as comic servants, in the Commedia, many authors have concluded that Pedrolino is either the "Italian equivalent" or the direct ancestor of the 17th-century French [[Pierrot]].&lt;ref&gt;"Italian equivalent" is Nicoll's phrase ([1963], p. 88); Mic writes that the historical connection between Pedrolino and Pierrot is "absolutely evident" (p. 211).  Sand and Duchartre assume a close kinship between the two characters, as does Oreglia; Storey (1978) sees Pedrolino and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] as establishing behavioral "poles" for Pierrot, between which he oscillates throughout his long history (pp. 73-74). As late as 1994, Rudlin (pp. 137-38) renames Pierrot "Pedrolino", in a translation of a scene from ''Arlequin, Empereur dans la lune'', first performed in 1684 and published in the Gherardi collection, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vDg0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 vol. 1, p. 179].&lt;/ref&gt;  But there is no documentation from that century that establishes a clear connection between the two types.  "Dominique" Biancolelli, Harlequin of the first Paris-based Italian troupe in which Pierrot appeared by name, contended that Pierrot was conceived as a [[Pulcinella]], not a Pedrolino:  "The nature of the ''rôle''," he wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is that of a Neapolitan Pulcinella a little altered.  In point of fact, the Neapolitan scenarii, in place of Arlecchino and Scapino, admit two Pulcinellas, the one an intriguing rogue and the other a stupid fool.  The latter is Pierot's [sic] ''rôle''.&lt;ref&gt;MS 13736, Bibliothèque de l'Opéra, Paris, I, 113; cited and tr. Nicoll (1931), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more direct source is the patois-spouting and lovelorn peasant Pierrot of [[Molière]]'s play ''[[Dom Juan|Don Juan, or The Stone Guest]]'' (1665).  Some eight years after its highly successful premiere, the Italians spoofed Molière's comedy with an ''Addendum to "The Stone Guest"'', in which Pierrot first appeared by name among his fellow masks;&lt;ref&gt;Both masked and unmasked characters of the Commedia were known as "masks": see Andrews, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; he was played by one Giuseppe Giaratone, an actor who thereafter would be identified with the character for the next quarter-century.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey (1978), pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Molière's, Giaratone's Pierrot would also prove to be lovelorn, subject to a malady that does not afflict Pedrolino.&lt;ref&gt;"Pedrolino's love for Franceschina sometimes provides the occasion for a farcical scuffle between him and Arlecchino (''Li Duo vecchi gemelli'' [The Two Old Twins]) or for a burst of jealous anger when he is cuckolded by Doctor Gratiano (''La Fortunata Isabella'' [Lucky Isabella]).  But it never elicits the tenderness, both comic and pathetic, that infuses [a] scene of [[Jean-François Regnard|Regnard]]'s ''La Coquette'' (1691), in which Pierrot stands tongue-tied with love before his master's young daughter, Columbine": Storey (1978), pp. 25-26.  For the scene, see Gherardi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 vol. 3, pp. 100-102].&lt;/ref&gt;  And, notwithstanding Giaratone's usually playing Pierrot as an Italianate ''zanni'', it is probably no accident that, in several of the plays left behind by his troupe, Pierrot is portrayed as a patois-spouting peasant in the French mold.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA195 Act III, scene iii] of [[Eustache Le Noble]]'s ''Harlequin-Aesop'' (1691) in the Gherardi collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedrolino and Pierrot are clearly differentiated by their respective functions in the plots of their plays.  Pedrolino, as a first ''zanni'', is, as Mic notes above, the "dynamic" element of the play; Pierrot, on the other hand, as a second ''zanni'', is static.  The latter appears, as Storey writes, "in comparative isolation from his fellow masks, with few exceptions, in all the plays of ''Le Théâtre Italien'', standing on the periphery of the action, commenting, advising, chiding, but rarely taking part in the movement around him."&lt;ref&gt;Storey (1978), pp. 27-28. ''Le Théâtre Italien'' is the Gherardi collection cited in "References" below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pedrolino, by contrast, is not a character to be caught standing still.

'''Philosophy of language''' in the analytical tradition explored logic and accounts of the mind at the end of the nineteenth century, with English-speaking writers [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] being pivotal, followed by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''), the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], while on the continent a foundation work was Ferdinand de [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'', published posthumously in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/|title=Philosophy of Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of Language may investigate the relations between language, language users, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-language|title=Philosophy of language|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of Philosophy of Language may include inquiry into the origins of [[language]], the nature of meaning, the usage and cognition of language. It overlaps to some extent with the study of [[Epistemology]], [[Logic]], [[Philosophy of mind|Philosophy of Mind]] and other fields (including linguistics and psychology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_philosophy_of_language.html|title=Philosophy of Language - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense it may be said that the philosophy of language explores the relationship between language and reality. In particular, philosophy of language studies issues that cannot be addressed by other fields, like linguistics, or psychology. Major topics in the philosophy of language include the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|nature of meaning]], [[intentionality]], [[reference]], the constitution of sentences, concepts, [[learning]], and [[thought]].

==Overview==
The topic that has received the most attention in the philosophy of language has been the ''nature'' of meaning, to explain what "meaning" is, and what we mean when we talk about meaning. Within this area, issues include: the nature of [[synonymy]], the origins of meaning itself, our apprehension of meaning, and the nature of composition (the question of how meaningful units of language are composed of smaller meaningful parts, and how the meaning of the whole is derived from the meaning of its parts).

Secondly, this field of study seeks to better understand what speakers and listeners do with language in [[communication]], and how it is used socially. Specific interests include the topics of [[Language acquisition|language learning]], language creation, and [[speech act]]s.

Thirdly, the question of how language relates to the minds of both the speaker and the [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] is investigated. Of specific interest is the grounds for successful [[translation]] of words and concepts into their equivalents in another language.

Finally, philosophers of language investigate how language and meaning relate to [[truth]] and [[Reference|the reality being referred to]]. They tend to be less interested in which sentences are ''actually true'', and more in  ''what kinds of meanings can be true or false''. A truth-oriented philosopher of language might wonder whether or not a meaningless sentence can be true or false, or whether or not sentences can express propositions about things that do not exist, rather than the way sentences are used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Major topics and sub-fields==

===Composition and parts===
{{Philosophy-of-language-key-terms}}
It has long been known that there are different [[parts of speech]]. One part of the common sentence is the [[lexical word]], which is composed of [[nouns]], verbs, and adjectives. A major question in the field – perhaps the single most important question for [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] and [[structuralism|structuralist]] thinkers – is, "How does the meaning of a sentence emerge out of its parts?"

[[File:syntactic-semantic trees.gif|right|thumb|230px|Example of a syntactic tree]]

Many aspects of the problem of the composition of sentences are addressed in the field of linguistics of [[syntax]]. Philosophical semantics tends to focus on the [[principle of compositionality]] to explain the relationship between meaningful parts and whole sentences. The principle of compositionality asserts that a sentence can be understood on the basis of the meaning of the ''parts'' of the sentence (i.e., words, morphemes) along with an understanding of its ''structure'' (i.e., syntax, logic).&lt;ref&gt;Pagin, P. "Are Holism and Compositionality Compatible?" In ''Olismo''. ed. Massimo dell'Utri. Macerata: Quodlibet. 2002. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, syntactic propositions are arranged into 'discourse' or 'narrative' structures, which also encode meanings through [[pragmatics]] like temporal relations and pronominals.&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy GivónJohn Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to use the concept of ''functions'' to describe more than just how lexical meanings work: they can also be used to describe the meaning of a sentence. Take, for a moment, the sentence "The horse is red". We may consider "the horse" to be the product of a ''[[propositional function]]''. A propositional function is an operation of language that takes an entity (in this case, the horse) as an input and outputs a ''semantic fact'' (i.e., the proposition that is represented by "The horse is red"). In other words, a propositional function is like an algorithm. The meaning of "red" in this case is whatever takes the entity "the horse" and turns it into the statement, "The horse is red."&lt;ref name="Stainton"&gt;Stainton, Robert J. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=889RAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophical perspectives on language]. Peterborough, Ont., Broadview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists have developed at least two general methods of understanding the relationship between the parts of a linguistic string and how it is put together: syntactic and semantic trees. [[Syntax|Syntactic]] trees draw upon the words of a sentence with the ''[[grammar]]'' of the sentence in mind. [[Semantics|Semantic]] trees, on the other hand, focus upon the role of the ''meaning'' of the words and how those meanings combine to provide insight onto the genesis of semantic facts.

{{Main|Meaning (linguistic)}}
{{Main|Meaning (philosophy of language)}}

There have been several distinctive explanations of what a [[Meaning (linguistics)|linguistic "meaning"]] is. Each has been associated with its own body of literature.

* The [[ideational theory of meaning]], most commonly associated with the British [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[John Locke]], claims that meanings are [[mental representation]]s provoked by signs.&lt;ref&gt; Grigoris Antoniou, John Slaney (eds.), ''Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence'', Springer, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this view of meaning has been beset by a number of problems from the beginning (see the main article for details), interest in it has been renewed by some contemporary theorists under the guise of ''[[semantic internalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Ned. "Conceptual Role Semantics" [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/ConceptualRoleSemantics.html (online)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth-conditional theory of meaning]] holds meaning to be the conditions under which an expression may be true or false. This tradition goes back at least to [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and is associated with a rich body of modern work, spearheaded by philosophers like [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref name="Tarsk"&gt;Tarski, Alfred. (1944). ''The Semantical Conception of Truth''. [http://www.ditext.com/tarski/tarski.html PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TandI"&gt;Davidson, D. (2001) ''Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-924629-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[use theory of meaning]], most commonly associated with the [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]], helped inaugurate the idea of "meaning as use", and a [[communitarian]] view of language. Wittgenstein was interested in the way in which the communities use language, and how far it can be taken.&lt;ref name="LW"&gt;Wittgenstein, L. (1958) ''Philosophical Investigations''. Third edition. trans. G. E. M. Anscombe. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with [[P. F. Strawson]], [[John Searle]], [[Robert Brandom]], and others.&lt;ref name="Brand"&gt;Brandom, R. (1994) ''Making it Explicit''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-54330-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] theory of meaning claims that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality it is describing through [[speech act]]s, which for linguistics was as revolutionary a discovery as for [[physics]] was the discovery that the very act of [[measurement]] can change the measured reality itself.  [[Speech act]] theory was developed by [[J. L. Austin]], although other previous thinkers have had similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Filozofija jezika i pragmatika |trans-title=Philosophy of language and pragmatics |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446878.rec_PUPOVAC.PDF |deadurl=no |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Revija |volume=30 |issue=7 |page=99 |year=1990 |issn=0034-6888 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AZGjjiCD?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446878.rec_PUPOVAC.PDF |accessdate=6 June 2015 |df= }} [http://katalog.nsk.hr/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=000147293 (NSK)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''reference theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, also known collectively as ''[[semantic externalism]]'', views meaning to be equivalent to those things in the world that are actually connected to signs. There are two broad subspecies of externalism: social and environmental.

* The [[verificationist]] theory of meaning is generally associated with the early 20th century movement of [[logical positivism]]. The traditional formulation of such a theory is that the meaning of a sentence is its method of verification or falsification. In this form, the thesis was abandoned after the acceptance by most philosophers of the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]] of [[confirmation holism]] after the publication of [[W.V.O. Quine|Quine]]'s "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Voltolini, A. (2002) "Olismi Irriducibilmente Indipendenti?". In ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo Dell'Utri. Macerata: Quodlibet. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Dummett]] has advocated a modified form of verificationism since the 1970s. In this version, the ''comprehension'' (and hence meaning) of a sentence consists in the hearer's ability to recognize the demonstration (mathematical, empirical or other) of the truth of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;Dummett, M. (1991) ''The Logical Basis of Metaphysics''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|88-15-05669-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic theory of meaning]] is any theory in which the meaning (or understanding) of a sentence is determined by the consequences of its application. Dummett attributes such a theory of meaning to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and other early 20th century [[American philosophy|American]] pragmatists.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;
* The [[contrast theory of meaning]] suggests that knowledge attributions have a ternary structure of the form 'S knows that p rather than q'. This is in contrast to the traditional view whereby knowledge attributions have a binary structure of the form 'S knows that p'.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, J., "Contrastive Knowledge," in Gendler and Hawthorne, eds.

Other theories exist to discuss [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|non-linguistic meaning]] (i.e., meaning as conveyed by body language, meanings as consequences, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Grice, Paul. "Meaning". ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000), ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference&lt;!--'Philosophy of reference', 'Reference theory', and 'Theory of reference' redirect here--&gt;===

Investigations into how language interacts with the world are called '''theories of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. [[Gottlob Frege]] was an advocate of a [[mediated reference theory]]. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components: sense and reference. The sense of a sentence is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding sentence expresses. Senses determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. [[Referent]]s are the objects in the world that words pick out. The senses of sentences are thoughts, while their referents are [[truth value]]s (true or false). The referents of sentences embedded in [[propositional attitude]] ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;Frege, G. (1892) "On Sense and Reference". In ''Frege: Senso, Funzione e Concetto''. eds. [[Eva Picardi]] and [[Carlo Penco]]. Bari: Editori Laterza. 2001. {{ISBN|88-420-6347-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in his later writings and for reasons related to his theory of acquaintance in [[epistemology]], held that the only directly referential expressions are, what he called, "logically proper names". Logically proper names are such terms as ''I'', ''now'', ''here'' and other [[indexical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Jason. (2006). [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/routledge.pdf Philosophy of Language in the Twentieth Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424165706/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/routledge.pdf |date=2006-04-24 }}. Forthcoming in the Routledge Guide to Twentieth Century Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaynesford, M. de ''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed proper names of the sort described above as "abbreviated [[definite description]]s". Hence ''Donald J. Trump'' may be an abbreviation for "the current President of the United States and husband of Melania Trump."  Definite descriptions are denoting phrases (see "[[On Denoting]]") which are analyzed by Russell into existentially quantified logical constructions. Such phrases denote in the sense that there is an object that satisfies the description. However, such objects are not to be considered meaningful on their own, but have meaning only in the [[proposition]] expressed by the sentences of which they are a part. Hence, they are not directly referential in the same way as logically proper names, for Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (1905) "On Denoting". Published in ''Mind''.[http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Russell/denoting/ online text], Neale, Stephen (1990) Descriptions, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (1903) ''I Principi della Matematica''. Original title: ''The Principles of Mathematics''. Italian trans. by Enrico Carone and Maurizio Destro. Rome: Newton Compton editori. 1971. {{ISBN|88-8183-730-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Frege's account, any [[referring expression]] has a sense as well as a referent. Such a "mediated reference" view has certain theoretical advantages over Mill's view. For example, co-referential names, such as ''Samuel Clemens'' and ''Mark Twain'', cause problems for a directly referential view because it is possible for someone to hear "Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens" and be surprised – thus, their cognitive content seems different.

Despite the differences between the views of Frege and Russell, they are generally lumped together as [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivists]] about proper names. Such descriptivism was criticized in [[Saul Kripke]]'s ''Naming and Necessity''.

Kripke put forth what has come to be known as "the modal argument" (or "argument from rigidity"). Consider the name ''Aristotle'' and the descriptions "the greatest student of Plato", "the founder of logic" and "the teacher of Alexander". [[Aristotle]] obviously satisfies all of the descriptions (and many of the others we commonly associate with him), but it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] that if Aristotle existed then Aristotle was any one, or all, of these descriptions. Aristotle may well have existed without doing any single one of the things for which he is known to posterity. He may have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he may have died in infancy. Suppose that Aristotle is associated by Mary with the description "the last great philosopher of antiquity" and (the actual) Aristotle died in infancy. Then Mary’s description would seem to refer to Plato. But this is deeply counterintuitive. Hence, names are ''[[rigid designator]]s'', according to Kripke. That is, they refer to the same individual in every possible world in which that individual exists. In the same work, Kripke articulated several other arguments against "[[Frege–Russell view|Frege–Russell]]" descriptivism.&lt;ref name="SK" /&gt;

It is worth noting that the whole philosophical enterprise of studying reference has been critiqued by linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] in various works.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. ''New horizons in the study of language and mind''. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piattelli-Palmarini, Massimo, Juan Uriagereka, and Pello Salaburu, eds. ''Of Minds and Language: A Dialogue with Noam Chomsky in the Basque Country: A Dialogue with Noam Chomsky in the Basque Country''. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind and language ===

==== Innateness and learning ====
Some of the major issues at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy of mind are also dealt with in modern [[psycholinguistics]]. Some important questions are ''How much of language is innate? Is language acquisition a special faculty in the mind? What is the connection between thought and language?''

There are three general perspectives on the issue of language learning. The first is the [[behaviorist]] perspective, which dictates that not only is the solid bulk of language learned, but it is learned via conditioning. The second is the ''hypothesis testing perspective'', which understands the child's learning of syntactic rules and meanings to involve the postulation and testing of hypotheses, through the use of the general faculty of intelligence. The final candidate for explanation is the [[Psychological nativism|innatist]] perspective, which states that at least some of the syntactic settings are innate and hardwired, based on certain modules of the mind.&lt;ref name="Fodor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fodor |first=Jerry A. |title=The Modularity of Mind: An Essay in Faculty Psychology |year=1983 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;Pinker, S. (1994) ''L'Istinto del Linguaggio''. Original title: ''The Language Instinct''. 1997. Milan: Arnaldo Mondadori Editori. {{ISBN|88-04-45350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying notions of the structure of the brain when it comes to language. [[Connectionism|Connectionist]] models emphasize the idea that a person's lexicon and their thoughts operate in a kind of distributed, [[associationism|associative]] network.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, P. (1995) Engine of Reason, Seat of the Soul: A Philosophical Journey Into the Brain. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychological nativism|Nativist model]]s  assert that there are [[language acquisition device|specialized devices]] in the brain that are dedicated to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt; [[Computationalism|Computation]] models emphasize the notion of a representational [[language of thought]] and the logic-like, computational processing that the mind performs over them.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J and E. Lepore. (1999) "All at Sea in Semantic Space: Churchland on Meaning Similarity." Journal of Philosophy 96, 381–403.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergentism|Emergentist]] models focus on the notion that natural faculties are a complex system that emerge from simpler biological parts. [[Reductionism|Reductionist]] models attempt to explain higher-level mental processes in terms of the basic low-level neurophysiological activity of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R. (1979)''Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Language and thought ====
An important problem which touches both philosophy of language and [[philosophy of mind]] is to what extent language influences thought and vice versa. There have been a number of different perspectives on this issue, each offering a number of insights and suggestions.

Linguists [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir and Whorf]] suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a "linguistic community" can think about certain subjects (a hypothesis paralleled in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Kay, P. and W. Kempton. 1984. "What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis?" American Anthropologist 86(1): 65–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language was analytically prior to thought. Philosopher [[Michael Dummett]] is also a proponent of the "language-first" viewpoint.&lt;ref name=BlackwellPhil&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas |first2=E. P. |last2=Tsui-James |title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |pages=97, 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stark opposite to the Sapir–Whorf position is the notion that thought (or, more broadly, mental content) has priority over language. The "knowledge-first" position can be found, for instance, in the work of [[Paul Grice]].&lt;ref name="BlackwellPhil" /&gt; Further, this view is closely associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and his [[language of thought]] hypothesis. According to his argument, spoken and written language derive their intentionality and meaning from an internal language encoded in the mind.&lt;ref name="LOT"&gt;Fodor, J. ''The Language of Thought'', Harvard University Press, 1975, {{ISBN|0-674-51030-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main argument in favor of such a view is that the structure of thoughts and the structure of language seem to share a compositional, systematic character. Another argument is that it is difficult to explain how signs and symbols on paper can represent anything meaningful unless some sort of meaning is infused into them by the contents of the mind. One of the main arguments against is that such levels of language can lead to an infinite regress.&lt;ref name="LOT" /&gt; In any case, many philosophers of mind and language, such as [[Ruth Millikan]], [[Fred Dretske]] and Fodor, have recently turned their attention to explaining the meanings of mental contents and states directly.

Another tradition of philosophers has attempted to show that language and thought are coextensive – that there is no way of explaining one without the other. Donald Davidson, in his essay "Thought and Talk", argued that the notion of belief could only arise as a product of public linguistic interaction. [[Daniel Dennett]] holds a similar ''interpretationist'' view of [[propositional attitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gozzano, S. "Olismo, Razionalità e Interpretazione". In ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo dell'Utri. 2002. Macerata: Quodlibet. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To an extent, the theoretical underpinnings to [[cognitive semantics]] (including the notion of semantic [[framing (social sciences)|framing]]) suggest the influence of language upon thought.&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. (1987) ''Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind''. Chicago:University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46804-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same tradition views meaning and grammar as a function of conceptualization, making it difficult to assess in any straightforward way.

Some thinkers, like the ancient sophist [[Gorgias]], have questioned whether or not language was capable of capturing thought at all.
{{cquote|...speech can never exactly represent perceptibles, since it is different from them, and perceptibles are apprehended each by the one kind of organ, speech by another. Hence, since the objects of sight cannot be presented to any other organ but sight, and the different sense-organs cannot give their information to one another, similarly speech cannot give any information about perceptibles. Therefore, if anything exists and is comprehended, it is incommunicable.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgias (c. 375 BCE) translated by Kathleen Freeman. In Kaufmann, W. ''Philosophic Classics: Thales to Ockham''. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, Inc. 1961, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are studies that prove that languages shape how people understand causality. Some of them were performed by [[Lera Boroditsky]]. For example, English speakers tend to say things like "John broke the vase" even for accidents. However, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers would be more likely to say "the vase broke itself." In studies conducted by Caitlin Fausey at [[Stanford University]] speakers of English, Spanish and Japanese watched videos of two people popping balloons, breaking eggs and spilling drinks either intentionally or accidentally. Later everyone was asked whether they could remember who did what. Spanish and Japanese speakers did not remember the agents of accidental events as well as did English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2009/papers/559/paper559.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Russian language|Russian]] speakers, who make an extra distinction between light and dark blue in their language, are better able to visually discriminate shades of blue. The [[Pirahã people|Piraha]], a tribe in [[Brazil]], whose language has only terms like few and many instead of numerals, are not able to keep track of exact quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boroditsky |first=Lera |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703467304575383131592767868?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_MIDDLETopNews#printMode |title=Lost in Translation.

In one study German and Spanish speakers were asked to describe objects having opposite [[gender]] assignment in those two languages. The descriptions they gave differed in a way predicted by [[grammatical gender]]. For example, when asked to describe a "key"—a word that is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish—the [[German language|German]] speakers were more likely to use words like "hard," "heavy," "jagged," "metal," "serrated," and "useful," whereas Spanish speakers were more likely to say "golden," "intricate," "little," "lovely," "shiny," and "tiny." To describe a "bridge," which is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish, the German speakers said "beautiful," "elegant," "fragile," "peaceful," "pretty," and "slender," and the Spanish speakers said "big," "dangerous," "long," "strong," "sturdy," and "towering." This was the case even though all testing was done in English, a language without grammatical gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/boroditsky09/boroditsky09_index.html |title=How Does Our Language Shape The Way We Think? |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of studies conducted by Gary Lupyan, people were asked to look at a series of images of imaginary aliens.&lt;ref&gt;http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/papers/lupyan_rakison_mcClelland_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Whether each alien was friendly or hostile was determined by certain subtle features but participants were not told what these were. They had to guess whether each alien was friendly or hostile, and after each response they were told if they were correct or not, helping them learn the subtle cues that distinguished friend from foe. A quarter of the participants were told in advance that the friendly aliens were called "leebish" and the hostile ones "grecious", while another quarter were told the opposite. For the rest, the aliens remained nameless. It was found that participants who were given names for the aliens learned to categorize the aliens far more quickly, reaching 80 per cent accuracy in less than half the time taken by those not told the names. By the end of the test, those told the names could correctly categorize 88 per cent of aliens, compared to just 80 per cent for the rest. It was concluded that naming objects helps us categorize and memorize them.

In another series of experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lupyan/web/lupyan_2008_jepG.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102193358/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lupyan/web/lupyan_2008_jepG.pdf |archive-date=2013-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of people was asked to view furniture from an [[IKEA]] catalog. Half the time they were asked to label the object – whether it was a chair or lamp, for example – while the rest of the time they had to say whether or not they liked it. It was found that when asked to label items, people were later less likely to recall the specific details of products, such as whether a chair had arms or not. It was concluded that labeling objects helps our minds build a prototype of the typical object in the group at the expense of individual features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727761.500-whats-in-a-name-the-words-behind-thought.html?full=true |title=What's in a name?

=== Social interaction and language ===
A common claim is that language is governed by social conventions. Questions inevitably arise on surrounding topics. One question is, "What exactly is a convention, and how do we study it?", and second, "To what extent do conventions even matter in the study of language?" [[David Kellogg Lewis]] proposed a worthy reply to the first question by expounding the view that a convention is a ''rationally self-perpetuating regularity in behavior''. However, this view seems to compete to some extent with the Gricean view of speaker's meaning, requiring either one (or both) to be weakened if both are to be taken as true.&lt;ref name=BlackwellPhil /&gt;

Some have questioned whether or not conventions are relevant to the study of meaning at all. [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed that the study of language could be done in terms of the I-Language, or internal language of persons. If this is so, then it undermines the pursuit of explanations in terms of conventions, and relegates such explanations to the domain of "meta-semantics". ''Metasemantics'' is a term used by philosopher of language Robert Stainton to describe all those fields that attempt to explain how semantic facts arise.&lt;ref name="Stainton" /&gt; One fruitful source of research involves investigation into the social conditions that give rise to, or are associated with, meanings and languages. ''[[Etymology]]'' (the study of the origins of words) and ''[[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]]'' (philosophical argumentation over what makes "good grammar", relative to a particular language) are two other examples of fields that are taken to be meta-semantic.

Not surprisingly, many separate (but related) fields have investigated the topic of linguistic convention within their own research paradigms. The presumptions that prop up each theoretical view are of interest to the philosopher of language. For instance, one of the major fields of sociology, [[symbolic interactionism]], is based on the insight that human social organization is based almost entirely on the use of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Teevan, James J. and W.E. Hewitt. (2001) Introduction to Sociology: A Canadian Focus. Prentice Hall: Toronto. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, any explanation of a [[social structure]] (like an [[institution]]) would need to account for the shared meanings which create and sustain the structure.

[[Rhetoric]] is the study of the particular words that people use to achieve the proper emotional and rational effect in the listener, be it to persuade, provoke, endear, or teach. Some relevant applications of the field include the examination of [[propaganda]] and [[didactic]]ism, the examination of the purposes of [[Profanity|swearing]] and [[pejorative]]s (especially how it influences the behavior of others, and defines relationships), or the effects of gendered language. It can also be used to study [[linguistic transparency]] (or speaking in an accessible manner), as well as [[performative]] utterances and the various tasks that language can perform (called "speech acts"). It also has applications to the study and interpretation of law, and helps give insight to the logical concept of the [[domain of discourse]].

[[Literary theory]] is a discipline that some literary theorists claim overlaps with the philosophy of language. It emphasizes the methods that readers and critics use in understanding a text. This field, an outgrowth of the study of how to properly interpret messages, is unsurprisingly closely tied to the ancient discipline of [[hermeneutics]].

==Language and Continental philosophy==
In [[Continental philosophy]], language is not studied as a separate discipline, as it is in [[analytic philosophy]]. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], [[hermeneutics]], Heideggerean [[ontology]], [[existentialism]], [[structuralism]], [[deconstruction]] and [[critical theory]]. The idea of language is often related to that of logic in its Greek sense as "[[logos]]", meaning discourse or dialectic. Language and concepts are also seen as having been formed by history and politics, or even by historical philosophy itself.

The field of hermeneutics, and the theory of interpretation in general, has played a significant role in 20th century Continental philosophy of language and [[ontology]] beginning with [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger combines phenomenology with the hermeneutics of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Heidegger believed language was one of the most important concepts for ''[[Dasein]]''. Heidegger believed that language today is worn out because of overuse of important words, and would be inadequate for in-depth study of Being (''Sein''). For example, ''Sein'' (''being''), the word itself, is saturated with multiple meanings. Thus, he invented new vocabulary and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|linguistic styles]], based on [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[Etymology|etymological]] word relations, to disambiguate commonly used words. He avoided words like consciousness, ego, human, nature, etc. and instead talked holistically of [[Being-in-the-world]], [[Dasein]].

With such new concepts as ''Being-in-the-world'', Heidegger constructs his theory of language, centered on [[Speech communication|speech]]. He believed speech (talking, listening, silence) was the most essential and pure form of language. Heidegger claims writing is only a supplement to speech, because even a reader constructs or contributes one's own "talk" while reading. The most important feature of language is its ''projectivity'', the idea that language is prior to human speech. This means that when one is "thrown" into the world, his existence is characterized from the beginning by a certain pre-comprehension of the world. However, it is only after naming, or "articulation of intelligibility", can one have primary access to ''Dasein'' and ''Being-in-the-World''.&lt;ref name="Being"&gt;Heidegger, Martin.(1996) ''Being and Time''. New York: Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-19770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] expanded on these ideas of Heidegger and proposed a complete hermeneutic ontology. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer describes language as "the medium in which substantive understanding and agreement take place between two people."&lt;ref name="Gadamer"&gt;Gadamer, Hans G. (1989)''Truth and Method'', New York: Crossroad, 2nd ed., {{ISBN|0-8264-0401-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gadamer claims that the world is linguistically constituted, and cannot exist apart from language. For example, monuments and statues cannot communicate without the aid of language. Gadamer also claims that every language constitutes a world-view, because the linguistic nature of the world frees each individual from an objective environment: "... the fact that we have a world at all depends upon [language]  and presents itself in it. The world as world exists for man as for no other creature in the world."&lt;ref name="Gadamer" /&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]], on the other hand, proposed a hermeneutics which, reconnecting with the original Greek sense of the term, emphasized the discovery of  hidden meanings in the equivocal terms (or "symbols") of [[ordinary language]]. Other philosophers who have worked in this tradition include [[Luigi Pareyson]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="Volli"&gt;Volli, U. (2000) ''Manuale di Semiotica''. Rome-Bari: Editori Laterza. {{ISBN|88-420-5953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Semiotics]] is the study of the transmission, reception and meaning of signs and symbols in general. In this field, human language (both natural and artificial) is just one among many ways that humans (and other conscious beings) are able to communicate. It allows them to take advantage of and effectively manipulate the external world in order to create meaning for themselves and transmit this meaning to others. Every object, every person, every event, and every force communicates (or ''signifies'') continuously. The ringing of a telephone for example, ''is'' the telephone. The smoke that I see on the horizon is the sign that there is a fire. The smoke signifies. The things of the world, in this vision, seem to be ''labeled'' precisely for intelligent beings who only need to interpret them in the way that humans do. Everything has meaning. True communication, including the use of human language, however, requires someone (a ''sender'') who sends a ''message'', or ''text'', in some code to someone else (a ''receiver''). Language is studied only insofar as it is one of these forms (the most sophisticated form) of communication. Some important figures in the history of semiotics, are [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Roman Jakobson]]. In modern times, its best-known figures include [[Umberto Eco]], [[A.J. Greimas]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Tullio De Mauro]].&lt;ref name="Volli" /&gt; Investigations on signs in non-human communications are subject to [[biosemiotics]], a field founded in the late 20th century by [[Thomas Sebeok]] and [[Thure von Uexküll]].

==Problems in the philosophy of language==

===Vagueness===
One issue that has troubled philosophers of language and logic is the problem of the [[vagueness]] of words. The specific instances of vagueness that most interest philosophers of language are those where the existence of "borderline cases" makes it seemingly impossible to say whether a predicate is true or false. Classic examples are "is tall" or "is bald", where it cannot be said that some borderline case (some given person) is tall or not-tall. In consequence, vagueness gives rise to the [[paradox of the heap]]. Many theorists have attempted to solve the paradox by way of ''n''-valued logics, such as [[fuzzy logic]], which have radically departed from classical two-valued logics.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, Roy. (2006) "Vagueness". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vagueness/#3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem of universals and composition ===
{{Further|problem of universals}}
One debate that has captured the interest of many philosophers is the debate over the meaning of ''[[universals]]''. One might ask, for example, "When people say the word ''rocks'', what is it that the word represents?" Two different answers have emerged to this question. Some have said that the expression stands for some real, abstract universal out in the world called "rocks". Others have said that the word stands for some collection of particular, individual rocks that we associate with merely a nomenclature. The former position has been called ''[[philosophical realism]]'', and the latter ''[[nominalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue here can be explicated if we examine the proposition "Socrates is a Man".

From the radical realist's perspective, the connection between S and M is a connection between two abstract entities. There is an entity, "man", and an entity, "Socrates". These two things connect in some way or overlap.

From a nominalist's perspective, the connection between S and M is the connection between a particular entity (Socrates) and a vast collection of particular things (men). To say that Socrates is a man is to say that Socrates is a part of the class of "men". Another perspective is to consider "man" to be a ''property'' of the entity, "Socrates".

There is a third way, between nominalism and radical realism, usually called "moderate realism" and attributed to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Moderate realists hold that "man" refers to a real essence or form that is really present and identical in Socrates and all other men, but "man" does not exist as a separate and distinct entity. This is a realist position, because "Man" is real, insofar as it really exists in all men; but it is a moderate realism, because "Man" is not an entity separate from the men it informs.

=== Nature of language ===
Many philosophical discussions of language begin by clarifying terminology. One item which has undergone  significant scrutiny is the idea of language itself. Those philosophers who have set themselves to the task ask two important questions: "What is language in general?" and "What is a particular, individual language?"

Some [[semiotic]] outlooks have stressed that language is the mere manipulation and use of symbols in order to draw attention to signified content. If this were so, then humans would not be the sole possessors of language skills.&lt;ref name="Volli" /&gt; On the other hand, many works by linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] have emphasized the role of syntax as a characteristic of any language.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1985)''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory/'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

More puzzling is the question of what it is that distinguishes one particular language from another. What is it that makes "English" English? What's the difference between Spanish and French? Chomsky has indicated that the search for what it means to be a language must begin with the study of the internal language of persons, or [[I-language]]s, which are based upon certain rules (or principles and parameters) which generate grammars. This view is supported in part by the conviction that there is no clear, general, and principled difference between one language and the next, and which may apply across the field of all languages. Other attempts, which he dubs ''E-languages,'' have tried to explain a language as usage within a specific speech community with a specific set of well-formed utterances in mind (markedly associated with linguists like Bloomfield).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. "Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin, and Use." ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000) ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal versus informal approaches ===
Another of the questions that has divided philosophers of language is the extent to which formal logic can be used as an effective tool in the analysis and understanding of natural languages. While most philosophers, including [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], have been more or less skeptical about formalizing natural languages, many of them developed formal languages for use in the sciences or formalized ''parts'' of natural language for investigation. Some of the most prominent members of this tradition of formal semantics include Tarski, Carnap, [[Richard Montague]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;Partee, B. [http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Richard_Montague_by_%20Partee_05.pdf Richard Montague (1930–1971)]. In Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd Ed., ed. Keith Brown. Oxford: Elsevier. V. 8, pp. 255–57, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side of the divide, and especially prominent in the 1950s and 60s, were the so-called "Ordinary language philosophers". Philosophers such as [[P. F. Strawson]], [[John Langshaw Austin]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]] stressed the importance of studying natural language without regard to the truth-conditions of sentences and the references of terms. They did not believe that the social and practical dimensions of linguistic meaning could be captured by any attempts at formalization using the tools of logic. Logic is one thing and language is something entirely different. What is important is not expressions themselves but what people use them to do in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, W. G. (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j94wa55sCU8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Austin developed a theory of [[speech act]]s, which described the kinds of things which can be done with a sentence (assertion, command, inquiry, exclamation) in different contexts of use on different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=J.L. |year=1962 |title=[[How to Do Things With Words]]: The William James Lectures delivered at Harvard University in 1955 |editor=ed. J.O. Urmson. |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-674-41152-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strawson argued that the truth-table semantics of the logical connectives (e.g., &lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \lor &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt;) do not capture the meanings of their natural language counterparts ("and", "or" and "if-then").&lt;ref&gt;P. F. Strawson, "On Referring". ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 59, No. 235 (Jul., 1950), pp. 320–344&lt;/ref&gt; While the "ordinary language" movement basically died out in the 1970s, its influence was crucial to the development of the fields of speech-act theory and the study of [[pragmatics]].  Many of its ideas have been absorbed by theorists such as [[Kent Bach]], [[Robert Brandom]], [[Paul Horwich]] and [[Stephen Neale]].&lt;ref name="Brand" /&gt; In recent work, the division between semantics and pragmatics has become a lively topic of discussion at the interface of philosophy and linguistics, for instance in work by Sperber and Wilson, Carston and Levinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32589501|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Sperber,|first=Dan|last2=Wilson|first2=Deirdre|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=|year=|isbn=9780631198789|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=32589501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49525903|title=Thoughts and utterances : the pragmatics of explicit communication|last=Robyn.|first=Carston,|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Pub|isbn=9780631178910|location=Oxford, U.K.|oclc=49525903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45733473|title=Presumptive meanings : the theory of generalized conversational implicature|last=C.|first=Levinson, Stephen|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262621304|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=45733473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While keeping these traditions in mind, the question of whether or not there is any grounds for conflict between the formal and informal approaches is far from being decided. Some theorists, like [[Paul Grice]], have been skeptical of any claims that there is a substantial conflict between logic and natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Grice, Paul. "Logic and Conversation". ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000) ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and interpretation===
Translation and interpretation are two other problems that philosophers of language have attempted to confront. In the 1950s, [[W.V. Quine]] argued for the indeterminacy of meaning and reference based on the principle of ''[[radical translation]]''. In ''[[Word and Object]]'', Quine asks readers to imagine a situation in which  they are confronted with a previously undocumented, group of indigenous people where they must attempt to make sense of the utterances and gestures that its members make. This is the situation of radical translation.&lt;ref name="WVQ"&gt;Quine, W.V. (1960) ''Word and Object''. MIT Press; {{ISBN|0-262-67001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed that, in such a situation, it is impossible ''in principle'' to be absolutely certain of the meaning or reference that a speaker of the indigenous peoples language attaches to an utterance. For example, if a speaker sees a rabbit and says "gavagai", is she referring to the whole rabbit, to the rabbit's tail, or to a temporal part of the rabbit. All that can be done is to examine the utterance as a part of the overall linguistic behaviour of the individual, and then use these observations to interpret the meaning of all other utterances. From this basis, one can form a manual of translation. But, since reference is indeterminate, there will be many such manuals, no one of which is more correct than the others. For Quine, as for Wittgenstein and Austin, meaning is not something that is associated with a single word or sentence, but is rather something that, if it can be attributed at all, can only be attributed to a whole language.&lt;ref name="WVQ" /&gt; The resulting view is called ''[[semantic holism]]''.

Inspired by Quine's discussion, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] extended the idea of radical translation to the interpretation of utterances and behavior within a single linguistic community. He dubbed this notion ''radical interpretation''. He suggested that the meaning that any individual ascribed to a sentence could only be determined by attributing meanings to many, perhaps all, of the individual's assertions, as well as their mental states and attitudes.&lt;ref name="TandI" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|History of linguistics}}

===Ancient philosophy===
Linguistic speculation in [[Indian subcontinent|India]] is attested since the [[Vedic period]] ([[Iron Age in India|Iron Age]]), beginning with the deification of ''[[vāk]]'' "speech" and the role of language (utterance, [[shabda]]) in [[Kalpa (ritual)|ritual]]. [[Vyākaraṇa|Sanskrit grammatical tradition]] gives rise to linguistic philosophy beginning in the final centuries BC and early centuries AD, notably in the philosophical schools of [[Nyaya]] and [[Mimamsa]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the West, inquiry into language stretches back to the 5th century BC with [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, S. "History of the Philosophy of Language". In ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. ed. Ted Honderich. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both in India and in Greece, linguistic speculation predates the emergence of [[grammar|grammatical traditions]] of systematic description of language, which emerged around the 5th century BC in India (see [[Yāska]]), and around the 3rd century BC in Greece (see [[Rhianus]]).

In the dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato considered the question of whether the names of things were determined by convention or by nature. He criticized [[conventionalism]] because it led to the bizarre consequence that anything can be conventionally denominated by any name. Hence, it cannot account for the correct or incorrect application of a name. He claimed that there was a natural correctness to names. To do this, he pointed out that [[compound words]] and phrases have a range of correctness. He also argued that primitive names had a natural correctness, because each [[phoneme]] represented basic ideas or sentiments. For example, for Plato the letter ''l'' and its sound represented the idea of softness. However, by the end of the ''Cronic'', he had admitted that some social conventions were also involved, and that there were faults in the idea that phonemes had individual meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Cratylus''(c. 360 BCE) Series: Cambridge Studies in the Dialogues of Plato. Trans. David Sedley. Cambridge:University of Cambridge Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58492-0}} also available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1616 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle interested himself with the issues of [[logic]], categories, and meaning creation. He separated all things into categories of [[species]] and [[genus]]. He thought that the meaning of a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] was established through an abstraction of the similarities between various individual things. This theory later came to be called ''nominalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven K. Strange, (1992) ''Porphyry: On Aristotle, Categories''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-2816-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Aristotle took these similarities to be constituted by a real commonality of form, he is more often considered a proponent of "moderate realism".

The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers made important contributions to the analysis of grammar, distinguishing five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, appellatives (names or [[epithet]]s), [[conjunctions]] and [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. They also developed a sophisticated doctrine of the ''lektón'' associated with each sign of a language, but distinct from both the sign itself and the thing to which it refers. This ''lektón'' was the meaning (or sense) of every term. The ''lektón'' of a sentence is what we would now call its [[proposition]]. Only propositions were considered "[[truth-bearer]]s" or "truth-vehicles" (i.e., they could be called true or false) while sentences were simply their vehicles of expression. Different ''lektá'' could also express things besides propositions, such as commands, questions and exclamations.&lt;ref&gt;Mates, B. (1953) ''Stoic Logic''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-02368-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval philosophy===
Medieval philosophers were greatly interested in the subtleties of language and its usage. For many [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], this interest was provoked by the necessity of translating [[Greek language|Greek]] texts into [[Latin]]. There were several noteworthy philosophers of language in the medieval period. According to Peter J. King, (although this has been disputed), [[Peter Abelard]] anticipated the modern ideas of ''[[sense and reference]]''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Peter. ''Peter Abelard.'' Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/#4&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[William of Ockham]]'s ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' brought forward one of the first serious proposals for codifying a mental language.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. (1999) "Is there Synonymy in Occam's Mental Language?". Published in ''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham'', edited by Paul Vincent Spade. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58244-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholastics of the high medieval period, such as Ockham and [[John Duns Scotus]], considered logic to be a ''scientia sermocinalis'' (science of language). The result of their studies was the elaboration of linguistic-philosophical notions whose complexity and subtlety has only recently come to be appreciated. Many of the most interesting problems of modern philosophy of language were anticipated by medieval thinkers. The phenomena of vagueness and ambiguity were analyzed intensely, and this led to an increasing interest in problems related to the use of ''syncategorematic'' words such as ''and'', ''or'', ''not'', ''if'', and ''every''. The study of ''categorematic'' words (or ''terms'') and their properties was also developed greatly.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;Marconi, D. "Storia della Filosofia del Linguaggio". In ''L'Enciclopedia Garzantina della Filosofia''. ed. Gianni Vattimo. Milan: Garzanti Editori. 1981. {{ISBN|88-11-50515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major developments of the scholastics in this area was the doctrine of the ''suppositio''.&lt;ref name="KKP"&gt;[[Norman Kretzmann|Kretzmann, N.]], [[Anthony Kenny]] &amp; [[Jan Pinborg]]. (1982) ''Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-22605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppositio of a term is the interpretation that is given of it in a specific context. It can be ''proper'' or ''improper'' (as when it is used in [[metaphor]], [[metonym]]s and other figures of speech). A proper suppositio, in turn, can be either formal or material accordingly when it refers to its usual non-linguistic referent (as in "Charles is a man"), or to itself as a linguistic entity (as in "''Charles'' has seven letters"). Such a classification scheme is the precursor of modern distinctions between [[use–mention distinction|use and mention]], and between language and metalanguage.&lt;ref name="KKP" /&gt;

There is a tradition called speculative grammar which existed from the 11th to the 13th century.  Leading scholars included, among others, Martin of Dace and Thomas of Erfurth.

===Modern philosophy===
Linguists of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods such as [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]], [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[John Wilkins]] were infatuated with the idea of a [[philosophical language]] reversing the [[confusion of tongues]], influenced  by the gradual discovery of [[Chinese character]]s and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] (''[[Hieroglyphica]]''). This thought parallels the idea that there might be a universal language of music.

European scholarship began to absorb the [[Vyākaraṇa|Indian linguistic tradition]] only from the mid-18th century, pioneered by [[Jean François Pons]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] (the ''editio princeps'' of [[Varadarāja]], a 17th-century [[Sanskrit]] grammarian, dating to 1849).

In the early 19th century, the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] insisted that language ought to play a larger role in [[Western philosophy]]. He argues that philosophy has not sufficiently focused on the role language plays in cognition and that future philosophy ought to proceed with a conscious focus on language:

{{quote|If the claim of philosophers to be unbiased were all it pretends to be, it would also have to take account of language and its whole significance in relation to speculative philosophy&amp;nbsp;... Language is partly something originally given, partly that which develops freely. And just as the individual can never reach the point at which he becomes absolutely independent&amp;nbsp;... so too with language.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In Cloeren, H. ''Language and Thought''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Contemporary philosophy===
{{also|Ordinary language philosophy}}
The phrase "[[linguistic turn]]" was used to describe the noteworthy emphasis that contemporary philosophers put upon language.

Language began to play a central role in Western philosophy in the early 20th century. One of the central figures involved in this development was the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]], whose work on philosophical logic and the philosophy of language in the late 19th century influenced the work of 20-century [[analytic philosopher]]s [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The philosophy of language became so pervasive that for a time, in [[analytic philosophy]] circles, philosophy as a whole was understood to be a matter of philosophy of language.

In [[Continental philosophy]], the foundation work was [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'', published posthumously in 1916.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">In [[sociology]] and especially the [[sociology of religion|sociological study of religion]], '''plausibility structures''' are the sociocultural contexts for systems of meaning within which these meanings make sense, or are made plausible. Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes.

==Origins==

The term was coined by [[Peter L. Berger]], who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[G. H. Mead]], and [[Alfred Schutz]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy - Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967) p. 45 and p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social "world" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise.

==Decline of religious plausibility==

Berger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.change.freeuk.com/learning/socthink/berger.html Peter Berger's ''the Homeless Mind'' thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; Berger considered that history "constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was "an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1971) p. 121 and p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wuthnow, ''Rediscovering the Sacred'' (1992) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger may also underestimate the role of self-selected [[reference group]]s in maintaining one's plausibility structures,&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology (2007) p. 319-20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the erosion of the modernist trend of secularization that took place with [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Phillips/D. L. Okholm, ''Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World'' (1995) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6735">A '''political myth''' is an ideological narrative that is believed by social groups.

In 1975, Henry Tudor defined it in the book ''Political Myth''. He said that myths are believed to be true even if they may be false, and they are devices with dramatic constructions used "in order to come to grips with reality". Political myths simply deal with political topics and always use a group of people as the hero or [[protagonist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Yolanda Flores |editor1-last=Niemann |editor2-first=Susan |editor2-last=Armitage |editor3-first=Patricia |editor3-last=Hart |editor4-first=Karen |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Weathermon |title=Chicana leadership: the Frontiers reader |year=2002 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location= |isbn=0-8032-8382-2 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdxTkGIL1osC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22political%20myth%22%20and%20nationalism&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=Henry%20Tudor's%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Christopher G. Flood described a working definition of a political myth as "an ideologically marked narrative which purports to give a true account of a set of past, present, or predicted political events and which is accepted as valid in its essentials by a social group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Myth |last=Flood |first=Christopher |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location= |isbn=0-415-93632-2 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoS7q5nTY78C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=political%20myth&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=working%20definition&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples cited as political myths include [[Manifest Destiny]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bass, J.D. &amp; Cherwitz R.A. |year=1978 |title=Imperial mission and manifest destiny: A case study of political myth in rhetorical discourse |journal=Southern Speech Communication Journal |publisher=Routledge |volume=43 |issue= |pages=213–32 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Clash of Civilizations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chiara Bottici &amp; Benoît Challand |date=August 2006 |title=Rethinking Political Myth; The Clash of Civilizations as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=European Journal of Social Theory |publisher= |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=315–36 |doi=10.1177/1368431006065715}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[national myth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Archard |date=September 1995 |title=Myths, Lies and Historical Truth: a Defence of Nationalism |journal=Political Studies |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=472–81 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1995.tb00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 [[Ernst Cassirer]] recounted political theory in his ''The Myth of the State''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cassirer |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Cassirer |title=The Myth of the State |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=0QNxMcwNu7cC |accessdate= |year=1946 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0300000367|page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, T.L. Thorson wrote in the 4th edition of ''[[A History of Political Theory]]'': "It is the mark of a modern mind to be able to explicitly create a 'myth' as a way of influencing others (as, for example, [[Plato]] does in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''). In it original sense myth is a literal description."&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Thorson (1973) [[A History of Political Theory]], 4th edition, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

According to Tudor, what recasts myth as [[Politics|political]] in nature is its subject matter,&lt;ref name=HT&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Myth|last=Tudor|first=Henry|publisher=Praeger|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} that being politics. In order for a political narrative to be recast as myth, the narrative of events must be cast in dramatic form and it must serve a practical argument.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;{{rp|16}}

Tudor defines ''dramatic form'', stating "there is indeed a critical event by reference to which men can order their present experience but the events in question are thought of as taken place in the past."&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;{{rp|16}} The function of political myth can be better understood when it is broken down into the following components: (1) myth provides the theoretical argument, which is incorporated into an (2) ideology that supports the myth by providing a practical argument.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;{{rp|127}}

Every myth has its protagonist/heroic figure that represents a particular community destined to create a morally coherent world which orients the community's activities towards this end.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;{{rp|138}} 
[[wikt:Mythopoeic|Mythopoeic]] narratives in political discourse can range from origin stories ([[foundation myth]]s) that recount the establishment of a community, to ascribing a political existence to a community based in the future (often a [[Utopia|utopic]] vision), to restoring a political community that has ceased to exist. 

Although, both myth and ideology carry certain values and beliefs, [[ideology]] provides a practical argument rooted in rendering the community's past experiences as coherent, allowing them to make sense of their present circumstances and often, as a result, providing communities with objectives for future activities. A myth is considered a ''political myth'' when the narrative provides an ideologically marked account of the past, present, and future of the political community.&lt;ref name=CF&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Myth|last=Flood|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=42|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ''ideologically marked'', the narrative carries "assumptions, values, and goals associated with a specific ideology… that conveys an implicit invitation to assent to a particular ideological standpoint."&lt;ref name=CF/&gt;

In short, political myths offer "an account of the past and the future in the light of which the present can be understood." &lt;ref name=HT/&gt;{{rp|139}} A political myth's success is dependent on the practical argument being accepted as true.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;{{rp|138}}

'''''Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion''''' is a 1958 book about human [[pregnancy]] by the anthropologist [[Paul Gebhard]], the sexologist [[Wardell Pomeroy]], the sexologist [[Clyde Martin]], and Cornelia Christenson. It was a publication of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]]. The work was prepared and written with careful attention to sampling, methodology and date interpretation, to demonstrate the Institute for Sex Research's scientific competence despite the death of [[Alfred Kinsey]] and to answer the criticism that the Institute was interested only in popular, moneymaking books. Though it did not receive the public acceptance of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', the work was well received in scientific circles, and demonstrated that the Institute could survive as a productive research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pom82|Pomeroy 1982. p. 450.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">'''''Prince Prigio''''' is a literary and comic [[fairy tale]] written by [[Andrew Lang]] in 1889, and illustrated by [[Gordon Browne]].  It draws in Lang's folklorist background for many tropes. 

A sequel was published in 1893, ''Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia: Being the Adventures of Prince Prigio's Son''. The two were issued in one 1895 volume as ''My Own Fairy Book: Namely, Certain Chronicles of Pantouflia, As Notably the Adventures of Prigio, Prince of That Country, and of His Son, Ricardo, with an Excerpt from the Annals of Scotland, As Touching Ker of Fairnilee, His Sojourn with the Queen of Faery''. All three books were published by J. W. Arrowsmith of Bristol. ''My Own Fairy Book'' appeared during the run of "[[Coloured Fairy Books]]" edited by Lang and published in London and New York by [[Longmans, Green, and Co.]] from 1890: ''The Blue Fairy Book'', ''The Red Fairy Book'', and so on. Longmans was also the US publisher of the Pantouflia books.

The two stories were also published together as ''The Chronicles of Pantouflia'' by Little, Brown and Company in 1942, with illustrations by Robert Lawson, and by [[David R. Godine]] in 1981. &lt;!-- nothing special about this issue? --&gt;

==Plot summary==

The plot of ''Prince Prigio'' begins with the introduction of a queen who does not believe in [[fairy|fairies]]. After many childless years, she and the king finally had a boy, Prigio. When the queen refused to invite the fairies to the christening, none of the nobles would attend, and so the king and queen were alone when the fairies arrived and presented the child with gifts. Among the gifts were a never-empty purse ([[Fortunatus' purse]]), [[seven-league boots]], a [[cap of invisibility|cap of darkness]] which would make him invisible, a [[wish]]ing cap, a [[magic carpet]], and also beauty, courage, and luck, but the last fairy decreed, "My child, you shall be too clever!"

This would have pleased the queen, but she did not believe it.  She had all the items swept into a lumber room.  

The prince grew up to be too clever.  He would argue with everyone and knew better than everyone.  He had two younger brothers, neither of whom was clever, and both of whom were liked; they fell in love with their cousins.  The king particularly disliked Prigio, fearing he would claim the throne, and wanted to be rid of him.  One day, a [[Firedrake (mythology)|firedrake]] appeared in the country; the king was sorry that it would kill his second son as well as his first before the [[youngest son]] killed it, but he would sacrifice him to be rid of Prigio.  Prigio, like his mother, refused to believe in its existence and reminded him that it was the youngest son who triumphed, so they should send him at once.  

Alphonse, his youngest brother, went and was eaten; Prigio, still not believing in firedrakes, thought he had gone off to travel.  The king sent Enrico, the second, as well, and he also died.  The king tried to send Prigio, who refused because he still disbelieved in the firedrake and also he was the last surviving heir.  The king decided to take the rest of the court and abandon Prigio alone in the castle.  When they did, Prigio found they also stole every piece of clothing except what he wore.  He searched the castle and found the lumber room with the fairies' gifts.  The seven-league boots bore him to an inn to eat, and he thought he dreamed it.  No one paid any attention to him; he did not know that he was wearing an invisibility cap.  He stole food, and when his cap was knocked off, paid from it from the purse -- which he found still full later.  Whenever his cap came on or off, he appeared or vanished, but did not realize it.  

Still invisible, he went to a ball where everyone spoke badly of him except for one lady, who praised his aiding a poor student, and Prigio fell madly in love with her.  At once, he believed in fairies and magic and realized everything that had happened to them.  He used the things to make himself suitable for the ball and went and met the lady, the daughter of the English Ambassador, Lady Rosalind.  When she spoke of the firedrake, he said he would kill it.  He went back and found a magical spyglass, which he knew from [[Arabian Nights]] and spied out the dragon.  He realized that even with his magical gifts, he had no chance, and his brothers had had none.  He went to library to find [[Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon|a book by Cyrano de Bergerac]] about his trip to the moon.  In it, he read of the [[Remora]], which was as cold as the firedrake was hot; he resolved to find one and make the creatures fight.  He found it using the spyglass, and went both creatures, taunting them in the other's name.  The monsters met, fought, and killed each other.  

He went back to the ambassador's house, and found that his father had issued a proclamation offering a reward for him, and another promising to make the Crown Prince, and marry to his niece, whoever brought the king the firedrake's horns and tail.  He also found that his carpet had vanished, a servant having accidentally wished himself to the royal castle, with the firedrake's horns and tail.

Then the carpet reappeared, with the servant, the king, and the queen, who refused to believe it.  The king refused to be reconciled with Prigio.  He tells how the servant claimed the reward, and when they disbelieved him, show them the carpet.

During the night, the prince went back and cut off the firedrake's hooves.  At court, the servant [[quibble (plot device)|claimed]] that the proclamation had promised the reward to whoever brought the horns and tail, not the dragon-slayer.  Prigio pointed out that if this was allowed, the king could not claim to say one thing and have meant another, which was a royal prerogative.  The niece refused to choose between them.  The king finally said that whoever brought its hooves would receive the reward.  Prigio produced them at once.  

The king insisted that he must marry his cousin, the promised niece, at once, or hang.  Prigio prefers to hang, but suggested that if he recovered his brothers, the king could remit his sentence.  The king agreed.  Prigio went back to the castle where he had been abandoned, killed an old cat he found there, burned it, and restored it to life with the water from the Fountain of Lions -- being certain that the fairies would not have neglected it.  Having thus tested it, he went to the firedrake's lair and restored his brothers; he then went to the remora's and restored the knights it had frozen.  

The king was pleased to see his sons but would not restore Prigio to the Crown Princeship.  Prigio pointed out he had the water and the firedrake's head, and the king agreed.

After a triple wedding, Rosalind suggested to Prigio that he could use the wishing cap and make himself no cleverer than anyone else.  Prigio agreed but thought better of it:  he wished himself to {{em|appear}} no more clever than anyone else.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">The '''East Asian Studies Department''' at [[Princeton University]] originally began as the '''Department of Oriental Languages and Literature''' (also later known as the '''Department of Oriental Studies''') in 1927. Both the graduate [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Philology]] programs presented an increasing need for an Asian studies curriculum that could not be addressed by these departments. The Department of Oriental Languages and Literature was formed in response to this growing need. In 1937, an undergraduate program also began to take shape, beginning with courses in [[Chinese art]] and Far Eastern politics. World War II hindered the development of the Asian language curriculum until 1956 when [[Frederick W. Mote]], a graduate of the Department of Oriental Studies, began regular work in [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]].

In 1960, the Department of Oriental Languages and Literature expanded to include [[Japanese language]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]] courses.  [[Marius Jansen]] was appointed as the head of the Japanese program.  During this time, an experimental [[Korean culture|Korean]] program was offered, which included studies in language, history, and politics.  However, this program proved unsuccessful, and another Korean program would not be instituted until 1993. In 1969, the Department of Oriental Studies received independent status and was renamed the East Asian Studies Department (the other component forming the [[Princeton University Department of Near Eastern Studies|Department of Near Eastern Studies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|year=1978|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Asian Studies Department cooperates with the [[Princeton University Department of Art and Archaeology|Department of Art and Archaeology]] to offer a doctoral program in Chinese or Japanese art and archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/artandarchaeology/grad/eastasian.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622133503/http://www.princeton.edu/artandarchaeology/grad/eastasian.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean program==
The Korean program officially began offering courses in 1993.  The four courses offered were Elementary Korean I and II and Intermediate Korean I and II. These subjects were taught by Professor Gwee-sook Kim and Professor Bong Choi.  Since then, the [[Korean language]] program has been growing steadily to include a greater diversity of classes for students to choose from.  Since the spring of 2011, students could select from eight courses including Advanced Korean I and II, Contemporary Korean Language and Culture, and 4th year Korean.  The Korean language department welcomes all students who have an interest in Korean language and culture.  Students are placed into the appropriate class based on level of proficiency as determined by placement tests. For those who wish to continue Korean studies in Korea either during the school year or after graduation, there are [[Study abroad in the United States|study abroad]] relationships and scholarships available at the South Korean institutions of [[Yonsei University]], [[Sogang University]], and [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberdorfer|first=Don|title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|year=1995|publisher=Mondadori|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]]]

'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.

In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be "realist" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].

There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. 

==Visual arts==
[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, détail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]
Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such "realism" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and "veristic" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between "realistic" (usually related to visual appearance) and "realist" is often useful, as is the term "illusionistic" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Realism+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Realism%20painting&amp;f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6–9, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3822829420|978-3822829424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross.

===Illusionistic realism===
[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna]]'' of 1853–55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]

The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art.  It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===
[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]

The depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.

Early Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.
[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]

In the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Velázquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.

Much art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Doré]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.

Medieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.

[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.

===Realist movement===
{{main|Realism (art movement)}}
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |title=NGA Realism movement |publisher=Nga.gov |date=1941-01-06 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement |title=National Gallery glossary, Realism movement |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm |title=Philosophy of Realism |publisher=Impressionist1877.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Nineteenth-Century French Realism &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.

===Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization===
[[File:La familia de Carlos IV.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800–01]]

Realism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday.  Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.

[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889.]]
A recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was "realism" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.

Renaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 30–32, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt; with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 59–64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905–06, ''[[Matin à Villeneuve|Matin à Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]
In the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative "classical-idealism" of [[the Carracci]] and the "naturalist" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used "naturalist" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to "Those who glory in the name of naturalists" (''naturalisti'').&lt;ref&gt;"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century "Naturalism" or the "'''Naturalist school'''" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of "naturalist" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: "The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science".&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

The term "continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as "Naturalist", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

Broadly defined as "the faithful representation of reality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donna M.

It focused on showing everyday activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Realism |title=Realism definition of Realism in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person [[objective reality]], without embellishment or interpretation and "in accordance with secular, [[empirical]] rules."&lt;ref&gt;in so far as such subjects are "explicable in terms of natural causation without resort to supernatural or divine intervention" [[#refMorris2003|Morris, 2003]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFAW6dh24ZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=realism&amp;ei=ROOkS_LBA5TszASD95nXCA&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such [[reality]] is [[ontological]]ly independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As [[Ian Watt]] states, modern realism "begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses" and as such "it has its origins in [[Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and received its first full formulation by [[Thomas Reid]] in the middle of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWatt1957|Watt, 1957]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While the preceding [[Romantic era]] was also a reaction against the values of the [[Industrial Revolution]], realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as "traditional" "bourgeois realism".&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt; Some writers of [[Victorian literature]] produced works of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Literature|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/victorian.php|publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of "bourgeois realism," prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as [[Modernist literature|modernism]]; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;[[John Barth]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]' '(1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;[[Gerald Graff]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

The achievement of realism in the [[theatre]] was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world.&lt;ref&gt;Simard, Rodney. ''Postmodern Drama: Contemporary Playwrights in America and Britain.''  New York: UP of America, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekov]], for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected [[slice of life]], exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater|last=Worthen|first=W.B.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0520286870|location=Berkeley, CA|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of [[melodrama]]tic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Theatre|last=Saxon|first=Theresa|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0748645206|location=Edinburgh|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Realism and American Drama, 1880–1940|last=Murphy|first=Brenda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0521327114|location=Cambridge|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development is also attributed to [[William Dean Howells]] and [[Henry James]] who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Cinema==
{{See also|Neorealism (art)|Poetic realism|Socialist realism}}

[[Italian Neorealism]] was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Realist films generally focus on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a "reality effect" to maintain its [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by [[Andre Bazin]] in the 1950s, acknowledges that a "film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a "preferred reading".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siegfried Kracauer]] is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
{{main|Verismo}}
Verismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], [[Umberto Giordano]], [[Francesco Cilea]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as [[Émile Zola]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Henrik Ibsen]] into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Chronology Of Western Classical Music 1600-2000|last=Paxman|first=Jon|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1783231218|location=London|pages=425–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tanner's Worth of Tune: Rediscovering the Post-war British Musical|last=Wright|first=Adrian|publisher=The Boydell Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1843835424|location=Suffolk, UK|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an account considered [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' and ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' as the first stirrings of the verismo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tosca|last=Carner|first=Mosco|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521228244|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', peaked in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;"Verismo" in Stanley Sadie (ed.)

Verismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] theatrical partnership of the [[dramatist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] (1842–1900).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Specifically, their play ''[[Iolanthe]]'' is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.

'''Revenge tragedy''' (sometimes referred to as '''revenge drama''', [[revenge play]], or '''tragedy of blood''') is a theoretical genre in which the principal theme is revenge and revenge's fatal consequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Formally established by American educator [[Ashley_Horace_Thorndike|Ashley H. Thorndike]] in his 1902 article "The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays," a revenge tragedy documents the progress of the protagonist's revenge plot and often leads to the demise of both the murderers and the avenger himself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thorndike, A. H. "The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays." ''Modern Language Association''. 17.2 (1902): 125-220. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre first appeared in [[Early modern Britain]] with the publication of [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' during the latter half of the 16th century''.'' Earlier works, such as [[Jasper Heywood]]'s translations of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (1560's) and [[Thomas Norton]] and [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]]'s play ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorbuduc]]'' (1561), are also considered revenge tragedies. Other well-known revenge tragedies include [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (c.1599-1602), ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c.1588-1593), and [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'' (c.1606).

==Revenge Tragedy as a Genre==
The genre of revenge tragedy is a modern invention, developed as a means of explaining early modern tragedies that maintain a theme or motif of revenge in varying degrees. Classification of the revenge tragedy is at times contentious, as with other early modern theatrical genres.[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s First Folio]] Lawrence Danson suggested that Shakespeare and his contemporaries had a "healthy ability to live comfortably with the unruliness of a theatre where the genre was not static but moving and mixing, always producing new possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Danson, Lawrence. ''Shakespeare's Dramatic Genres''. Oxford University Press, Oxford: 2000. Print. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Shakespeare's 1623 [[First Folio]]'s famously depicts the printer-imposed ([[William Jaggard]] and [[Edward Blount]]) three genres of comedy, history, and tragedy, leading readers to falsely believe that plays are easily categorized and contained.&lt;ref&gt;The First Folio, printed after his death, was also prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]].&lt;/ref&gt; While these three genres have remained staples in discussions of genre, other genres are often either invoked or created to accommodate the generic slipperiness of early modern drama. These include not only revenge tragedy, but also [[city comedy]], romance, [[pastoral]], and [[problem play]], among others.

It is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and "all Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lily. "Theories of Revenge in Renaissance England." ''Modern Philology''. 28.3 (1931) 281-296. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredson Bowers]]'s work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was originally marketed in the First Folio as ''The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.'' ''[[Hamlet]]'' was similarly titled in the First Folio as ''The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'' and ''The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'' in the [[Second Quarto]] edition (1604). It's not unusual to find present-day editors classifying these plays as tragedies;&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Lars. Introduction to ''The Duchess of Malfi''. ''The Duchess of Malfi''. By John Webster. ''English Renaissance Drama''. Eds. David Bevington, et al. Norton, New York: 2002. 1749-1754. Print. p. 1749.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weis, Rene. Introduction. ''John Webster'': The Duchess of Malfi ''and Other Plays''. By John Webster. Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1996. ix-xxviii. Print. p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy.

==Generic Conventions==
While these conventions don't apply to all plays that can be considered revenge tragedies, the events listed are common within the genre:
* The avenger is killed
* Spectacle for the sake of spectacle
* Villains and accomplices that assist the avenger are killed
* The supernatural (often in the form of a ghost who urges the protagonist to seek vengeance)
* A play within a play, or [[Dumbshow|dumb show]]
* Madness or feigned madness
* Disguise
* Violent murders, including [[decapitation]] and [[dismemberment]]
* [[Soliloquy|Soliloquies]]
* A [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] figure
* [[Cannibalism]] ([[Thyestes|Thyestean]] banquets)
* A fifth and final act where many characters are killed (multiple corpses on the stage)
* Degeneration of a once-noble protagonist
* In later [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] and [[Caroline_era|Caroline]] revenge tragedies, the protagonist is more often a villain than a hero (though this is subjective)
* In later revenge tragedies, there is often more than one character who seeks revenge

== Significant revenge tragedy playwrights ==

===Lucius Seneca===

[[Seneca the Younger|Lucius Seneca]] was a prominent playwright of the first century, famous for helping shape the genre of revenge tragedy with his ten plays: ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules Furens]], [[Troades (Seneca)|Troades]], [[Phoenissae (Seneca)|Phoenissae]], [[Medea (Seneca)|Medea]], [[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]], [[Oedipus (Seneca)|Oedipus]], [[Agamemnon (Seneca)|Agamemnon]], [[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]], [[Hercules Oetaeus]], and [[Octavia (play)|Octavia]].''&lt;ref&gt;Alkhaleefah, Tarek A. "The Senecan Tragedy and its Adaptation for the Elizabethan Stage: A Study of Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy." ''International Journal of English and Literature''6.9 (Sept. 2015): 163-167. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of his plays lies in the difficulty of the period. While the Elizabethan tragedy was considered more acceptable, revenge tragedy sought to unleash the carnal side of human nature on stage in a much more grotesque way. It was a transitional time in the literary world that would eventually lead to grueling pieces like these. Infamous scenes like the [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] feast in ''Thyestes'' introduce the audience to another dimension of the human experience, challenging them to reflect on extreme emotions and dig deeper into the conventions of the genre.

Seneca’s ''Thyestes'', a tale of revenge and horror with prominent cannibalism, can be identified as one of the first "revenge pieces." In the power struggle between two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, there is a clear theme of revenge. The underlying plot is Thyestes's affair with Atreus' wife. He stole his treasured golden fleece, and sneakily took the throne of Mycenae from him. After a long period of exile, Thyestes is allowed to return to Mycenae. However, the conflict escalates when Atreus executes his revenge by tricking Thyestes into eating his children. Although overtly grotesque, this piece of literature follows the conventions of the revenge tragedy genre. Ultimately, everyone ends up dead and revenge has been taken to a level that was not anticipated in the beginning.

===William Shakespeare===
[[William Shakespeare]] was an English poet and playwright from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alchin|first1=Linda K.|title=William Shakespeare|url=http://www.william-shakespeare.info/|website=William Shakespeare|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through plays like ''Hamlet'' and ''Titus Andronicus'', Shakespeare portrayed the basic characteristics of a revenge tragedy. He presented elements that are quite similar to those from Seneca's tragedies, establishing tragedy as a more well-known genre.

''Titus Andronicus'' depicts the madness of Titus, who wanted to take revenge on Tamora and her sons for what they did to Lavinia and Bassianus. This leads him to kill everybody that he faced in his search to satisfy himself and avenge them. The main plot focuses on Titus's revenge against Tamora and her sons, but also there are other people to whom he seeks vengeance. This is an element that can define a revenge tragedy. The appearance of cannibalism in the last scene at the banquet and grotesque elements during the play relate ''Titus Andronicus'' to Seneca's earlier revenge tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/titus/full.html|title=Titus Andronicus|last=|first=|date=|website=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/index.html|script-title=Titus Andronicus|access-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teofilo F. Ruiz''' (born 1943) is a [[Cuban-American]] medieval historian and professor, currently at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]). In 2012, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama. He is consistently rated as one of the most popular professors at UCLA, and has published many books as well as dozens of articles in scholarly journals as well as reviews and smaller articles.

==Early life==
Born in [[Cuba]], Ruiz was active during the [[Cuban Revolution]]. At age of 17, he fought against the regime of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. When his friend was killed in 1960, he resigned from the revolution and was immediately imprisoned. Ruiz was eventually released after the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] (1961) in order to make room for new prisoners of war.

In 1961, Ruiz left Cuba for [[Miami]] with "only three changes of clothing, $45, a box of Cuban cigars to sell and a Spanish translation of [[Jacob Burckhardt]]'s ''A History of Greek Civilization''." By 1962, Ruiz and two cousins moved from [[Miami]] to [[New York City]].  He worked at various jobs including as a taxi driver for one year. Despite many obstacles, Ruiz finished his dissertation in the Graduate School of [[Princeton University]] by 1974.

==Career==
Ruiz was a student of American medievalist [[Joseph R. Strayer]] and received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1974. He has taught at [[Brooklyn College]], the [[CUNY Graduate Center]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Michigan State University]], the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] and [[Princeton University]]. He served as chair of the UCLA Department of History from 2002–2005. He has lectured in the USA, [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[England]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and nations in [[Asia]].

In 2008, Ruiz was named chair of the UCLA Department of Spanish and Portuguese.

==Awards and honors==
In 1994 he was selected by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] as one of the four Outstanding Teachers of the Year in the United States. 

In 2007, Ruiz was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for his project on festivals, rituals, and power in late medieval and early modern Spain.

On February 13, 2012 President [[Barack Obama]] awarded Ruiz a 2011 [[National Humanities Medal]] at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite press release | url = http://m.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/monday-president-obama-award-2011-national-medal-arts-and-national-human | publisher = The White House | date = February 10, 2012 | title = MONDAY: President Obama to Award 2011 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruiz is honored in UCLA's Covel Commons as a recipient of the UCLA Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award.

The '''Thawri''' (Arabic:الثوري) [[Madhhab]] was a short lived school of [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]]. Its founder was [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Al-Thawri]], a great 8th Century [[alim|scholar]], jurist and hadith compiler.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Steven C. Judd, “Competitive hagiography in biographies of al-Awzaʿi and Sufyan al-Thawri”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 122:1 (Jan–March, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Ath-Thawri's]] move to Basra later in his life, his jurisprudential thought ([[Usul al-fiqh|usul]]) became more closely aligned to that of the [[Umayyads]] and of [[al-Awza'i|Al-Azwa'i]].&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt;

He spent the last year of his life hiding after a dispute between him and the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad Ibn Mansur Al-Mahdi]]. After his death, the Thawri [[Madhhab]] was taken up by his students, including notably Yahya al-Qattan.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; However, his school did not survive, but his jurisprudential thought and especially hadith transmission are highly regarded in Islam, and have influenced all the major [[madh'hab|schools]].

Lucas is a boy who is perceived as "strange" by his peers due to his funny glasses and propeller beanie (hat). Sid, the neighborhood bully, continuously bullies Lucas by spraying him with a water hose and stealing his hat. In an attempt to cope with Sid's actions, Lucas projects his anger onto a local colony of ants by spraying them with water, just as Sid has done to him.

The ants have enough and tackle and shove Lucas into the queen's chamber, and the queen confronts him about all of the trouble he has caused the colony. When Lucas is too shocked to even respond to her, the queen takes it as an insult, and orders an ant wizard to shrink the boy down to the size of an ant and take him to trial, where the judge declares him guilty. His punishment is to work hard like an ant, working in the field, gathering food, defending the colony from wasps and spiders, and taking care of the queen, the worst part of his punishment.

After a while, the queen tells Lucas that he has one last test to be set free: he must go home and bring her a Red Sweet Rock (jelly bean). Lucas brings two ants with him on the journey, and they ask him what it's like being a giant. Lucas tells them that he isn't a giant and gets picked on by Sid, who does all the same things Lucas does to the ants. When they reach his house, they find a box of swell jells, but Lucas's father sees the ants and tries to smash them with a fly swatter. Lucas shouts at his dad to stop, helping the ants to escape. Meanwhile, the queen is upset, fearing that Lucas was killed, but to her surprise he returns, and as promised she gives him the potion to return him to his right size. Lucas falls asleep and wakes up to see Sid, only to his surprise the ants got to him first and shrunk him as revenge.

'''''The Informant''''' is a [[nonfiction]] [[white-collar crime]] book written by journalist [[Kurt Eichenwald]] and published in 2000 by [[Random House]].&lt;ref name="Webber"&gt;{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Susan |title=Tale of the Tapes |work=The Daily Deal |publisher=[[Aurora Advisors]], Inc. |date=2000-09-25 |url=http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It documents the mid-1990s [[lysine price-fixing conspiracy]] case and the involvement of [[Archer Daniels Midland]] executive [[Mark Whitacre]], inspiring [[The Informant!|a film adaptation]] starring [[Matt Damon]] as Whitacre.

==Summary==
{{see also|Lysine price-fixing conspiracy}}
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-1/informant-true-story-part-1 Part One of ''Booknotes'' interview with Kurt Eichenwald  on ''The Informant'', February 4, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-2/informant-true-story-part-2 Part Two of ''Booknotes'' interview, February 11, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]}}
In the early 1990s, at the [[agri-business]] conglomerate [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), [[Mark Whitacre]] is a corporate vice president and head of the bio-products division. In November 1992, under pressure from his wife, Whitacre confesses to an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent that he, along with other ADM executives, routinely met with competitors to fix the price of [[lysine]], a food additive. Afterwards, Whitacre assists in gathering evidence against the other conspirators by secretly taping their activities during overseas business meetings. Over the course of three years, the FBI collects hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes documenting the largest case of price-fixing in history.

Whitacre is revealed to have defrauded $9 million from ADM at the same time he was aiding the FBI. After federal agents stage raid on ADM, the company hits back with damning evidence against the government's star witness. Whitacre becomes delusional and engages in [[pathological lying]] to save himself, leading the FBI to learn that he suffers from [[bipolar disorder]]. Worst of all, he gives false stories to the media about being forced to destroy evidence by the FBI. Whitacre becomes extremely manic, stops sleeping, and exhibits bizarre behavior as his meltdown continues. He attempts suicide a few months later, but is saved by his groundskeeper.

After seeing the movie ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'', Whitacre's delusional fantasy causes him to record and collect his conversations with FBI agents. Because he violated his immunity agreement with the government, Whitacre is charged with price-fixing along with the other ADM conspirators. Whitacre's attorney, James Epstein, successfully convinces the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials that the government was culpable for Whitacre's behavior as he was emotionally unprepared for the case. Epstein manages to get a very light sentence for Whitacre. However, Whitacre, unwilling to serve any jail time, fires Epstein.

At his trial, Whitacre is convicted and receives a federal prison sentence three times longer than the other conspirators. Whitacre's FBI handlers, along with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], attempt to obtain a [[presidential pardon]] for Whitacre. With remarkable support from the FBI and his wife, Whitacre recovers from his mental problems and, after leaving prison, is promoted to COO and president of a California biotechnology company.&lt;ref name="News Blaze"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writers |title=Mark Whitacre, Ph.D. Promoted at Cypress Systems, Inc. and a Warner Bros.

'''''The Satire of the Trades''''', also called '''''The Instruction of Dua-Kheti''''', is a work of [[wikt:didactic|didactic]] ancient Egyptian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Katheryn A. Bard, ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'', Routledge 1999, p.886&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of an [[Sebayt|Instruction]], composed by a scribe from Sile named Dua-Kheti for his son Pepi. The author is thought by some to have composed the ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat]]'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;I. E. S. Edwards, N. G. L. Hammond, C. J. Gadd, ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', Cambridge University Press 1975,  p.527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It describes  a number of trades in an exaggeratedly negative light, extolling the advantages of the profession of scribe. It is generally considered to be a [[satire]], though [[Wolfgang Helck|Helck]] thought it reflected the true attitude of the scribal class towards manual labourers.&lt;ref&gt;W. Helck, ''Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj'', Wiesbaden, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], between 2025 and 1700 BC. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/disability/n852.xml|title=SAGE Knowledge - Home|website=knowledge.sagepub.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text has survived in its entirety, but extremely corrupted, in the Sallier II Papyrus written during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], which is kept at the [[British Museum]]. A number of fragments are kept at the British Museum, the [[Louvre]], the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]], and other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, ''op.cit.'', pp.184f.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the texts most frequently copied by students during the [[Ramesside Period]].

==Use of the Satire in Ben Sira==

'''''The Spear''''' is a painting by [[Cape Town]]-based South African artist, [[Brett Murray]].  It depicts South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] in a pose reminiscent of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], with his genitals exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Govender|first=Peroshni|title=Presidential penis portrait riles S. Africa's ANC|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE84H07820120518|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting triggered a defamation lawsuit by Zuma's party, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and was vandalised on 22 May 2012.

== Exhibition ==
Prior to its being vandalised, ''The Spear'' was shown at the Goodman Gallery in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.  The painting featured as one of the pieces of artist Brett Murray's ''Hail to the Thief II'' exhibition, which commenced on 10 May 2012.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; Inspiration is understood to have been drawn from the [[Viktor Semyonovich Ivanov]]'s poster ''Lenin Lived, Lenin is Alive, Lenin Will Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The painting of President Zuma|url=http://inside-politics.org/2012/05/17/the-painting-of-president-zuma/|work=www.inside-politics.org|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition features various pieces that are critical of South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, showcasing sculptures and images that suggest [[corruption]] and bad governance.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodman Gallery - Hail to the Thief II|url=http://www.goodman-gallery.com/exhibitions/265|publisher=Goodman Gallery|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's works in the exhibition also include modifying ANC liberation struggle posters and flyers from the [[Apartheid]] era, some displaying the text "Amandla, we demand Chivas, BMWs and bribes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/saturday-star/it-s-staying-up-1.1302261 |title=It’s staying up! |author=Sameer Naik and Kashiefa Ajam |date=22 May 2012 |work=The Saturday Star |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public perception of Jacob Zuma ==
Zuma has often been the centre of scandal and ridicule, due to his polygamous lifestyle with many wives and girlfriends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob Zuma - "Polygamy is part of my culture"|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/jacob-zuma-polygamy-part-my-culture|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comment he made during his 2006 [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape trial]] that showering after sex would minimise the risk of contracting [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SA's Zuma 'showered to avoid HIV'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His lifestyle has made him the target of well-known cartoonist [[Zapiro]], who frequently depicts Zuma with a shower on his head, ridiculing the statements he made during his trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicolaides|first=Gia|title=Zapiro revives showerhead|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/574737.html|publisher=iafrica.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapiro was also sued for defamation by the ANC, with a hearing expected in October 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC185 /&gt; These public perceptions of Zuma provided part of the basis for Brett Murray's painting.&lt;ref name=BBC185&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18115724 |title=Jacob Zuma painting: ANC to sue South Africa's Brett Murray |date=18 May 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapiro added fuel to the fire by doing his own version of the painting, replacing the genitals with a showerhead.&lt;ref name=Zapiro185&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/890737-120520st |title=Published in Sunday Times on 20 May 2012 |date=20 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another appeared two days later, ridiculing Zuma.&lt;ref name=Zapiro186&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/892612-120522tt |title=120522tt - President Zuma outraged at Brett Murray's Painting - Spear of the Nation |date=22 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ANC response ==

Owner and director of the Goodman Gallery, Liza Essers, said that she received a telephone call on Sunday, 13 May 2012 from special advisor to the minister of arts and culture Mduduzi Mbata seeking to clarify her thoughts on the exhibition, after it had been reviewed in the newspaper [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']], along with a photograph of ''The Spear''. During the brief conversation she invited him to visit the gallery the following Tuesday, but he never kept the appointment.&lt;ref name=AiA&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubin|first=Steven|title=Liza Essers, Gallery Owner, on the Show that Scandalized South Africa|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/conversations/2012-06-05/liza-essers-brent-murray-goodman-gallery/|work=Art in America|publisher=Art in America|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ANC issued a press release on 17 May 2012 expressing outrage about the painting and their intention to apply to the High Court to have it removed, this being reiterated by attorneys representing the ANC and Jacob Zuma in an email sent to Essers the same day.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The painting drew strong condemnation from ANC rulers and various religious groups, who found the painting 'obscene' and 'vulgar'.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosomane|first=Phuti|title=Zuma painting against Ubuntu, African morality, culture|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|publisher=The New Age|accessdate=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526184457/http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|archivedate=26 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church called for the artist to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The ANC also demanded that the image be taken down from the [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']]' website.  ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said of the painting, "The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of comrade President Jacob Zuma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC to go to court over Zuma painting|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/ANC-to-go-to-court-over-Zuma-painting-20120517|publisher=News24.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma responded to the artwork by saying that it painted him as "a philanderer and a womaniser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting makes me a womaniser - Zuma|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/painting-makes-me-a-womaniser-zuma-1.1300191|accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=IOL.co.za|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to the impending legal action, gallery spokesperson Lara Koseff said its lawyers had responded that it would stay until the show was over, citing censorship concerns as central to the decision to allow the exhibition to continue.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"/&gt;  The [[African National Congress Women's League|ANC Women's League]] has also demanded that the exhibition be halted, and all instances of the image be removed from the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting violates president's integrity, says ANCWL|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/05/19/painting-violates-president-s-integrity-says-ancwl|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Times Live|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Grootes|title=Zuma portrait saga goes to court|url=http://www.ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173211/http://ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett Murray said that his painting had not been intended maliciously, but as "an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse".&lt;ref name=N24Defaced /&gt;

In the first day of legal proceedings, the representative for the ANC, Gcina Malindi, began sobbing and was unable to proceed, causing the process to be adjorned and postponed and the television coverage of the event was suppressed. Later, the ANC sought to drop proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zuma lawyers tears as court hears rude painting case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18186692|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News with video|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC advocate sobs in court|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ANC-advocate-sobs-in-court-20120524|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=News24|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Africa court hears Jacob Zuma obscene painting case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18182318|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway-Smith|first=Erin|title=Jacob Zuma The Spear painting case postponed indefinitely|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/south-africa/120524/the-spear-jacob-zuma-painting-court-case-anc-lawyer|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=GlobalPost|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences ===
The ANC's public condemnation of the painting brought widespread local and international attention to the painting, where otherwise it may have remained a relatively obscure piece of work.  For this reason, the action and subsequent fall-out has been characterised as an example of the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Hanging Out|url=http://6000.co.za/just-hanging-out/|publisher=6000 Miles from Civilization|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahere|first=Fadzayi|title=Why Zuma's Spear should stay up|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-8058-Why+Zumas+Spear+should+stay+up/opinion.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=New Zimbabwe|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, ''The Spear'' has been featured in editorials and news features in all forms of traditional and digital media.

Former ANC leader [[Oliver Tambo]]’s daughter Tselane Tambo was of the opinion that Zuma deserved Murray’s portrayal of him. She wrote on a social networking site, “Do the poor enjoy poverty? Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness? Do those who can’t get housing enjoy homelessness? He must get over it. No one is having a good time. He should inspire the reverence he craves. This portrait is what he inspired. Shame neh!”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: Zuma’s Spear painting sabotage|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/spear-today-gone-tomorrow.htm|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The South African .com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The media boycott of ''City Press'' by the ANC and various public figures led to the newspaper eventually removing the painting from its website on 28 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Waal|first=Mandy|title=City Press buckles to ANC demands - and threats|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-05-28-city-press-buckles-to-anc-demands-and-threats|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Maverick|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper's editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee cited several reasons for this decision, including violent threats made to her team by those supporting the boycott.{{or|date=July 2012}}

=== Media boycott ===
After ''City Press'' repeatedly refused to remove an image of the painting off their website, the ANC called upon its members and sympathisers to boycott placing advertising in, and buying of, the weekly paper.  A statement released by the ANC said: "Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values."  Responding to the boycott, ''City Press'' editor-in-chief [[Ferial Haffajee]] described Nzimande's call for a boycott of the paper as "deeply disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boycott 'immoral' ''City Press'', ANC urges|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Boycott-City-Press-the-paragon-of-immorality-ANC-20120524-2|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=News24.co.za|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC was criticised by the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Zuma genitals row escalates as ANC calls for boycott of newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/zuma-genitals-row-anc-newspaper-boycott|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said "While we recognise the right of the ANC to advise members on how to exercise their consumer decisions, the call for a boycott of a newspaper is tantamount to intimidation and abuse of power ...

== Defacement ==
On the morning of 22 May 2012, two men entered the gallery during visiting hours, and defaced the painting - first by painting a red cross over the depiction of Zuma's face and genitals, and then by smearing black paint over the canvas.  The two men — Barend la Grange and Lowie Mabokela&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/05/painting-south-african-presidents-penis-defaced/52698/ |title=Painting of South African President's Penis Defaced |author=Adam Martin |date=23 May 2012 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; — were arrested by security officials.  This defacement took place whilst court proceedings brought on by the ANC around the right to censor the image were underway.&lt;ref name=N24Defaced&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasley-Banks|first=Carrin|title=Zuma painting defaced at Goodman Gallery|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Zuma-painting-defaced-at-Goodman-Gallery-20120522|accessdate=22 May 2012|publisher=News24|date=22 May 2012|quote=The controversial painting depicting President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed was defaced by two men at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg on Tuesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zuma 'penis painting' defaced|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/795807.html|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=iafrica.com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
''The Spear'' portrait has invited comparison to other satirical pieces, including fellow South African artist [[Ayanda Mabulu|Ayanda Mabulu's]] work, ''{{lang|zu|Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi}}'' (Zulu: "Better poor than a rich puppet"), which depicts various regional and international political figures - including Jacob Zuma - in the nude.  The painting received additional attention following the media focus on controversial satirical artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butana|first=Kwanele|title=Cape artist despairs for ‘illiterate’ ANC|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/cape-artist-despairs-for-illiterate-anc-1.1302504|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time travel]] is a common theme in [[fiction]] and has been [[List of time travel works of fiction|depicted in a variety of media]], such as literature, television, film, and advertisements.&lt;ref name="Nahin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|title=Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction|date=1999|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9780387985718|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|title=Time Travel: A Writer's Guide to the Real Science of Plausible Time Travel|date=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=1421401207|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Time travel#History of the time travel concept|concept of time travel by mechanical means]] was popularized in [[H. G.

Time travel in modern fiction is sometimes achieved by [[Wormhole|space and time warps]], stemming from the scientific theory of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space and Time Warps|author=Stephen Hawking|date=1999|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time travel#History of the time travel concept|Stories from antiquity]] often featured time travel into the future through a [[#time slip|time slip]] brought on by traveling or sleeping,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} or in other cases, time travel into the past through supernatural means, for example brought on by [[angel]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alkon|first1=Paul K.|title=Origins of Futuristic Fiction|date=1987|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|isbn=082030932X|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spirits.&lt;ref name="Kuiper"/&gt;

==Time travel themes==

===Changing the past===
The idea of changing the past is logically [[contradiction|contradictory]], and results in a [[grandfather paradox]].&lt;ref name="unchangeable"&gt;{{cite web|author=Norman Swartz|title=Time Travel: Visiting the Past|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/time_travel1.htm|date=1993|publisher=SFU.ca|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul J. Nahin]], who has written extensively on the topic of time travel in fiction, states that "[e]ven though the consensus today is that the past cannot be changed, science fiction writers have used the idea of changing the past for good story effect".&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|267}} Time travel to the past and [[#Precognition|precognition]] without the ability to change events may result in [[causal loop]]s.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klosterman|first1=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|date=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=9781439168486|pages=60-62|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of characters inadvertently or intentionally changing the past also gave rise to the idea of "time police", people tasked with preventing such changes from occurring by themselves engaging in time travel to rectify such changes.&lt;ref name="Stableford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415974607|page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative future, history, timelines, and dimensions====
{{See also|Parallel universe (fiction)|Future history|Alternate history|:Category:Multiple time paths in fiction}}
An alternative future or alternate future is a possible [[future]] that never comes to pass, typically when someone travels back into the [[past]] and alters it so that the events of the alternative future cannot occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prucher|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Wolfe|first2=Gene|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195305678|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when a communication from the future to the past effected a change that alters the future.&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|165}} Alternative histories may exist "side by side", with the time traveller actually arriving at different dimensions as he changes time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Journeys in Space and Time|episode-link=|url=|accessdate=|series=[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]|series-link=|first=|last=|network=[[PBS]]|station=|date=November 16, 1980|season=|series-no=|number=8|minutes=|time=36 minute mark|transcript=|transcript-url=|quote=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Butterfly effect====
The [[butterfly effect]] is the notion that small events can have large, widespread consequences. The term describes events observed in [[chaotic systems|chaos theory]] where a very small change in initial conditions results in vastly different outcomes. The term was coined by mathematician [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]] years after the phenomenon was first described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilborn|first1=Robert C.|title=Sea gulls, butterflies, and grasshoppers: A brief history of the butterfly effect in nonlinear dynamics|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|date=April 2004|volume=72|issue=4|pages=425–427|doi=10.1119/1.1636492|bibcode=2004AmJPh..72..425H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect has found its way into popular imagination. For example, in Ray Bradbury's 1952 short story ''[[A Sound of Thunder]]'', the killing of a single insect millions of years in the past drastically changes the world, and in the 2004 film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'', the protagonist's small changes to their past results in extreme changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full|title=The meaning of the butterfly|author=Peter Dizikes|date=June 8, 2008|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication from the future===
In literature, [[communication]] from the future as a [[plot device]] is encountered in various [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories. [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] noted in his 1973 anthology of the best fiction of the year that "[t]he theme of getting hold of tomorrow's newspaper is a recurrent one".&lt;ref name="Ackerman"&gt;[[Forrest J. Ackerman]], ed., ''Best Science Fiction for 1973'' (1973), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of this device can be found in the [[H.G. Wells]] 1932 [[short story]] "[[The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper]]",&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0601931h.html|title=The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper|publisher=Gutenberg.net.au|date=1971-11-10|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the tale of a man who receives such a paper from 40 years in the future. The 1944 film ''[[It Happened Tomorrow]]'' also employs this device,&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt; with the protagonist receiving the next day's newspaper from an elderly colleague (who is possibly a ghost). Ackerman's anthology also highlights a short story by [[Robert Silverberg]], "What We Learned From This Morning's Newspaper".&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt; In that story, a block of homeowners wake to discover that on November 22, they have received the ''New York Times'' for the coming December 1.&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|38}} As characters learn of future events affecting them through a newspaper delivered a week early, the ultimate effect is that this "so upsets the future that spacetime is destroyed".&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|165}} The television series ''[[Early Edition]]'', inspired by the film ''It Happened Tomorrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=R.G.|title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film: Ali Baba to Zombies|date=1997|publisher=Applause|location=New York|isbn=1557832692|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; also revolved around a character who daily received the next day's newspaper,&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|235}} and sought to change some event therein forecast to happen.

A newspaper from the future can be a fictional edition of a real newspaper, or an entirely [[List of fictional newspapers|fictional newspaper]]. [[John Buchan]]'s novel ''[[The Gap in the Curtain]]'', is similarly premised on a group of people being enabled to see, for a moment, an item in ''[[The Times|Times]]'' newspaper from one year in the future. During the [[Swedish general election, 2006|Swedish general election of 2006]], the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Swedish liberal party]] used election posters which looked like news items, called ''Framtidens nyheter'' ("News of the future"), featuring things that Sweden in the future had become what the party wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fp-satsar-pa-lopsedlar-som-valaffischer/|title=Fp satsar på löpsedlar som valaffischer|publisher=Dagens nyheter|language=Swedish|trans-title=FP focuses on headlines as election posters|author=Gunnar Jonsson|date=29 June 2006|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A communication from the future raises questions about the ability of humans to control their destiny.&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|165}} If the recipient is allowed to presume that the future is malleable, and if the future forecast affects them in some way, then this device serves as a convenient explanation of their [[motivation]]s. In ''It Happened Tomorrow'', the events that are described in the newspaper do come to pass, and the protagonist's efforts to avoid those events set up circumstances which instead cause them to come about.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} By contrast, in ''Early Edition'', the protagonist is able to successfully prevent catastrophes predicted in the newspaper, although if the protagonist does nothing, these catastrophes do come about.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Where such a device is used, the source of the future news may not be explained, leaving it open to the reader or watcher to imagine that it might be technology, magic, an act of a god etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the H.G. Wells story,&lt;!--what story ?--&gt; the author writes of the newspaper that "apparently it had been delivered not by the postman, but by some other hand".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} As in ''It Happened Tomorrow'' and ''Early Edition'', no explanation is offered for the source of the future news. Ackerman suggests that "[t]he longer that authors mush on with the tale of... the next-week's-newspaper-now, the more difficult it becomes to pull a new rarebit out of the hat".&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt;

===Precognition===
[[Precognition]] has been explored as a form of time travel in fiction. Author [[J. B. Priestley]] wrote of it both in fiction and non-fiction, analysing testimonials of precognition and other "temporal anomalies" in his book ''Man and Time''. His books include time travel to the future through dreaming, which upon waking up results in memories from the future. Such memories, he writes, may also lead to the feeling of ''[[déjà vu]]'', that the present events have already been experienced, and are now being re-experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Katy|title=Testimonies of precognition and encounters with psychiatry in letters to J. B. Priestley|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|date=December 2014|volume=48|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.07.006|pmid=25176614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallible precognition, which describes the future as it truly is, leads to [[causal loop]]s, a form of which is explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=William Lane|title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox|journal=Philosophia|date=October 1987|volume=17|issue=3|pages=331–350|doi=10.1007/BF02455055|url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|date=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198240112|pages=356, 370-375|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"/&gt;

===Time loop===
{{See also|Time loop|List of films featuring time loops}}
A "time loop" or "temporal loop" is a [[plot device]] in which periods of time are repeated and re-experienced by the characters, and there is often some hope of breaking out of the cycle of repetition.&lt;ref name="sfencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chelsea Quinn Yarbro|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/time_loop|title=Time Loop|publisher=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]|date=|accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time loops are sometimes referred to as [[causal loop]]s,&lt;ref name="Klosterman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfencyclopedia"/&gt; but these two concepts are distinct. Although similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting. In a time loop when a certain condition is met, such as a death of a character or a clock reaching a certain time, the loop starts again, with one or more characters retaining the memories from the previous loop.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew|authorlink1=Matt Jones (writer)|last2=Ormrod|first2=Joan|title=Time Travel in Popular Media: Essays on Film, Television, Literature and Video Games|date=2015|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=0786478071|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories with time loops commonly center on the character learning from each successive loop through time.&lt;ref name="sfencyclopedia"/&gt;

===Time paradox===
{{further|Temporal paradox}}
Many time travel works explore the topic of disrupting causality leading to time paradoxes. One of the most commonly referred to in time travel literature is known as the [[grandfather paradox]]. Many works of fiction explore what would happen if a time traveller went back in time and changed the past, for example if they killed their own grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langford|first1=David|authorlink=David Langford|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/time_paradoxes|title=Time Paradoxes|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|date=|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time slip===
{{main|Time slip}}
A time slip is a [[plot device]] used in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] in which a person, or group of people, seem to [[time travel|travel through time]] by unknown means for a period of time.&lt;ref name="io9._Time"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeslip romance|author=Charlie Jane Anders|work=io9|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2015-08-27|url=http://io9.com/tag/timeslip-romance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Christopher|title=Philip K.

Time slips featuring a child and a realistic depiction of an earlier period enjoyed a vogue in the UK in the mid-20th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Successful examples include [[Alison Uttley]]'s ''A Traveller in Time'' (1939) going back to the time of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]; [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) returning to the 1880s and 1890s; [[Barbara Sleigh]]'s ''[[Jessamy]]'' (1967) and Penelope Farmer's ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'', both slipping back to the period of the [[First World War]]; [[Ruth Park]]'s ''[[Playing Beatie Bow]]'' (1980), where the slip in [[Sydney]], Australia, is to the squalor of 1873; and [[Helen Cresswell]]'s ''[[Moondial]]'', where three times periods are involved (1988, also televised).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Time tourism===
A "distinct subgenre" of stories explore the possibility that time travel might be used as a means of tourism,&lt;ref name="Kuiper"/&gt; with travelers curious to visit periods or events such as the [[Victorian Era]], [[Crucifixion of Christ]], or some point where [[dinosaur]]s could be watched (or hunted by [[big game hunter]]s), or to meet historical figures such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] or [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Stableford"/&gt; This theme can be addressed from two directions. An early example of present-day tourists travelling back to the past is [[Ray Bradbury]]{{'}}s ''A Sound of Thunder'' (1952), in which the protagonists are [[big game hunter]]s who travel to the distant past to hunt dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Kuiper"/&gt; An early example of the other type, in which tourists from the future visit the present, is [[Catherine L. Moore]] and [[Henry Kuttner]]{{'}}s ''[[Vintage Season]]'' (1946), a story which was selected for inclusion in Volume Two of ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two|The Science Fiction Hall of Fame]]'' collection.&lt;ref name="Bova"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bova|first1=Ben|title=[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two]]|date=2003|publisher=[[Tor Books]]|location=New York|isbn=9780765305343|pages=ix-xi|edition=1st|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immortality===
{{Unsourced section|date=October 2018}}
Instances of immortality are prevalent in time travel fiction. Oxford defines immortality as "the ability to live forever; eternal life." A distinct sub-thematic characteristic is warnings of said time-traveling immortals to other characters about the dangers of time travel. Some examples are 4th dimensional beings from ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', Professor Paradox from ''[[Ben 10]]'', and the Doctor from ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

===Time war===
{{See also|:Category:Temporal war fiction}}
''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' describes a time war as a fictional war that is "fought across time, usually with each side knowingly using time travel ... in an attempt to establish the ascendancy of one or another version of history". Time wars are also known as "change wars" and "temporal wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langford|first1=David|authorlink=David Langford|title=Changewar|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/changewar|website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul J. Nahin|P. Nahin]] compiles a variety of examples of fictional works that raise issues framed as arising in a time war:

{{quote|Consider this passage from ''[[The Fall of Chronopolis]]'' (Bayley), a novel about a "time-war." Just after the detection of temporal invaders, we read of them that "They had come in from the future at high speed, too fast for defensive time-blocks to be set up, and had only been detected by ground-based stations deep in historical territory. If the target was to alter past events—the usual strategy in a time-war—then the empire's chronocontinuity would be significantly interfered with." And in ''Time of the Fox'' (Costello), American physicists battle KGB physicists in a war of time travelers in the past, each side attempting to change history to its advantage. In this novel the history changers isolate themselves from all the alterations taking place outside of their Time Lab, and they compare their stored historical records with those of external libraries. That allows the staff historian to adjust for each new round of changes. As the historian explains, outside of the Time Lab "History might change, but here [in the Time Lab] the past lives on."

In a novel of a galaxy-wide confrontation between humans and [[android (robot)|androids]]—''Time and Again'' (Simak)—the use of time travel to alter history is central: "A war in time ... would reach back to win its battles. It would strike at points in time and space which would not even know that there was a war. It could, logically, go back to the silver mines of Athens, to the horse and chariot of Thut- mosis III, to the sailing of Columbus. ... It would twist the fabric of the past."&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|267}}}}

===Hitler and World War II===
In Western fiction, one common use of time travel technology is to travel back in time and attempt to kill [[Adolf Hitler]] in an attempt to avoid [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burnett |first1=Dean |title=Time travellers: please don’t kill Hitler |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/feb/21/time-travellers-kill-adolf-hitler |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 21, 2014 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction that applies the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] that the past can't be changed results in plots where attempts to assassinate Hitler or avert the war are destined to fail, or where they actually result in the rise of Hitler as history records it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Fiction that does allow the past to be changed often explores the unintended consequences of time travel or the [[butterfly effect]], which result in Germany and Japan winning World War II.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This outcome is also explored in parallel world fiction such as ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3425">The '''Wiesbaden manifesto''' is a document written and signed by members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] (MFAA) organization rejecting the plundering and removal of cultural items as spoils of war. The Allies created special commissions, such as the MFAA, to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to territories previously occupied by the Germans to find Nazi art repositories. The allies found these plundered artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and [[Austria]] at the end of [[World War II]]. The book ''The Safekeepers: Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II'' by former [[Walter Farmer|Capt. Walter I. Farmer]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] during World War II, chronicles the recovery of and restitution of discovered hidden loot of the [[Nazi plunder]], that were stolen from museums, private collections and libraries and individual [[Jewish]] emigrants and [[death camp]] prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II By Walter Ings Farmer, Klaus Goldmann Published by Walter de Gruyter, 2000 {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}, 242 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artifacts, and paintings from the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]]. The collecting point also received materials from the [[Reichsbank]] and [[Nazi]] looted [[Poles|Polish]] liturgical collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects, including paintings and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting point not only cataloged and restitutued items, but also kept them away from the [[Soviet Army]] and wartime reparations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opritsa D.

Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2003. xvi + 265 pp. $58.00 (cloth), {{ISBN|978-3-11-017730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Capt. Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden Manifesto on November 7, 1945, declaring "We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war." Among the co-signers was Lieutenant [[Charles Percy Parkhurst]] of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Walter I. Farmer. The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II. Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2000. x + 242 pp., {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of debate, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered that the paintings be returned to Germany in 1948.

{{Environmental law}}

The term ‘'''wild law'''’ was first coined by [[Cormac Cullinan]], to refer to human laws that are consistent with [[Earth jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= August 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wild law is a law made by people to regulate human behaviour that privileges maintaining the integrity and functioning of the whole Earth community in the long term, over the interests of any species (including humans) at a particular time.

==Background==

[[File:Amazon Rainforest-bird site.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in Brazil.]]

Wild laws are designed to regulate human participation within this wider community.  They seek to balance the rights and responsibilities of humans against those of other members of the community of beings within the [[natural environment]] that constitutes Earth (e.g. [[plants]], animals, [[rivers]], and [[ecosystems]]) in order to safe-guard the rights of all the members of the Earth [[community]].

Wild laws may be distinguished from laws based on the understanding that Earth is a conglomeration of objects which human beings are entitled to exploit for their exclusive benefit (e.g. most property laws).  The development of wild laws is motivated partially by the belief that it is desirable, and essential to the survival of many species (probably including humans), for us to change our relationship with the natural world from one of exploitation to a more ‘democratic’ participation in a community of other beings.  This requires laws that firstly, recognise that other members of the Earth community have [[rights]], and secondly, restrain humans from unjustifiably infringing those rights (as is done within the human community).

==Applications and consensus==

As a field, wild law cannot easily be categorised within traditional legal categories (e.g. [[substantive law|substantive]], [[procedural law|procedural]], [[private law|private]] or [[public law]]).  It is perhaps better understood as an approach to [[good governance|human governance]], rather than as a branch of law or a collection of laws.

A conference based on the concept of wild law was held in November 2005 at the [[University of Brighton]], UK. The conference was chaired by former Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and speakers included Jacqueline McGlade, head of the [[European Environment Agency]] and Lynda Warren of the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Former Environment Minister leads debate on 'Wild Law'|date=14 November 2005|url=http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2005/051114wildlaw.php?PageId=825|publisher=[[University of Brighton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, a conference based on the book ''Wild Law'' by Cormac Cullinan was held at the University of Brighton, UK, and organised jointly by [[UKELA]] and [[Environmental Law Foundation|ELF]]. 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law' and was chaired by John Elkington (of [[SustainAbility]] and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, [[Norman Baker]] MP (former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Environment Spokesman), [[Satish Kumar]] (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).

"A ‘Wild Law’ Response to Climate Change" workshop was held in September 2007 to develop a practical approach for applying Wild Law principles which are already helping shift legal processes in the US and South Africa.  Organised by [[UKELA]], with support from [[Environmental Law Foundation|ELF]] and the [[Gaia Foundation]], London and sponsored by [[The Body Shop]].  Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, with internationally renowned speakers [[Cormac Cullinan]], author of ''Wild Law'', [[Brian Goodwin|Professor Brian Goodwin]], visiting scholar and teacher on MSc in Holistic Science, at the [[Schumacher College]], International Centre for Ecological Studies, Devon, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of The [[Center for Food Safety]] in USA and founder of the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]], Peter Roderick, director of the Climate Justice Programme and was [[Friends of the Earth]]'s lawyer in London from 1996.

The "’Wild Law’ - Ideas into Action" residential workshop is to be held in September 2008, to launch the first phase of international research by the [[UKELA]] and the [[Gaia Foundation]] to identify Wild Law in practice and provide a Wild Law toolkit for decision makers and practitioners. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire, UK, workshop leaders include: [[Mellese Damtie]], Ethiopian lawyer and biologist, former Dean of the Legal Department at Ethiopia's Civil Service College, [[Andrew Kimbrell]], public interest attorney, activist and author, executive director of the Centre for Food Safety in USA and founder of the [[International Centre for Technology Assessment]]; and [[Professor Lynda Warren]], emeritus professor at [[Aberystwyth University]], environmental consultant and the research supervisor. Also participating, research paper coordinators, Begonia Filgueira, of Gaia Law Ltd and ERIC Ltd, and Ian Mason, practising barrister and Director of the [[Earth Jurisprudence Resource Centre]]; [[Cormac Cullinan]], an environmental lawyer based in Cape Town, South Africa, author of ''Wild Law'', director of the leading South African environmental law firm, Cullinan and Associates Inc., and CEO of EnAct International, an environmental governance consultancy; and [[Ng’anga Thiong’o]], legal and policy adviser for Kenyan community NGO, [[Porini]], and formerly to Green Belt Movement and Nobel prize winner, [[Wangari Maathai]]. This event is facilitated by Elizabeth Rivers, former commercial lawyer and professional facilitator, and Vicki Elcoate, Executive Director of UKELA.

'''Pope.L''' (also known as William Pope.L, born 1955 in [[Newark, New Jersey]]) is an American visual artist best known for his work in [[performance art]], and interventionist public art. However, he has also produced art in [[painting]], [[photography]] and [[theater]]. He was included in the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]] and is a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and a recipient of the [[Creative Capital]] Visual Arts Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://creative-capital.org/projects/view/180 "The Black Factory"], Creative Capital.&lt;/ref&gt; Selected now for the second time, Pope.L will be included in the upcoming [[Whitney Biennial]] of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2017Biennial|title=Whitney Biennial 2017 {{!}} Whitney Museum of American Art|website=whitney.org|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pope.L attended [[Pratt Institute]] from 1973 to 1975 and participated in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] Independent Study Program from 1977 to 1978.&lt;ref name="bio_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/popel|title=Pope.L :: Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/independentstudy80whit|title=Independent Study Program : fifteenth anniversary / Whitney Museum of American Art.|first=|last=Whitney Museum of American Art|date=29 June 1983|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Montclair State University]], [[Montclair, New Jersey]], in 1978.&lt;ref name="bio_1"/&gt; He received a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in visual arts from the [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]] at [[Rutgers University]], [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newfaculty.uchicago.edu/page/william-popel|title=William Pope.L - New Members of the University Faculty - The University of Chicago|website=newfaculty.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
From 1990 to 2010, Pope.L was a lecturer of [[Theater]] and [[Rhetoric]] at [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. As a faculty member he directed a production of [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s ''[[A Raisin In the Sun]]'', in which he used both African-American and Caucasian actors as members of the same family.

For ''ATM Piece'', performed in 1997, he attached himself with an eight-foot length of Italian sausage to the door of a [[Chase Bank]] in midtown Manhattan wearing nothing but a skirt made out of dollar bills.&lt;ref&gt;ArtForum, April 2004 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_/ai_n6080072 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''eRacism'', a project that Pope.L began during the late 1970s, included over 40 [[endurance]]-based performances consisting of “crawls”, varying in length and duration.  In one example titled ''Tompkins Square Crawl'' (1991) Pope.L dressed in a business suit and crawled through the gutter in [[Tompkins Square Park]], New York, pushing a potted flower with one hand.  Another example titled ''The Great White Way'' involved a crawl which stretched over 22 miles and took five years to complete. For this performance he donned a [[Superman]] outfit and strapped a skateboard to his back. The crawl stretched the entire 22 miles of Broadway, in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_5_91/ai_101010684/pg_2 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Documentation of this performance was included in the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]].

==2001 – 2010==
In 2001 the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) advisory renew panel granted Pope.L $42,000 in financing for a traveling retrospective called "William Pope.L: eRacism". Shortly after announcing the award, the acting chairman, [[Robert S. Martin]], rescinded funding for the grant.&lt;ref&gt;Art in America Feb 2002 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_/ai_82748785 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel Wachs]], then president of the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, stated in the December 21 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is important, particularly in light of what I would consider an attack on freedom of expression, to stand firm.  We want this exhibition to occur; we want other funders to step forward; we don't want the N.E.A.'s decision to be something that has the effect of stopping what I think is going to be an important exhibition of art." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Warhol Foundation, in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the LEF Foundation provided $50,000 in funding for the traveling retrospective to tour the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EFDE113EF932A15751C1A9679C8B63 "Warhol Foundation Finances Work Rebuffed by N.E.A."], ''The New York Times'', December 21,
 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''eRacism'' exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art at Maine College of Art; Diverse Works Art space, Houston, 2003; [[Portland Institute for Contemporary Art]] (PICA), Oregon, 2003; and Artists Space, New York, 2003 .

The catalog "William Pope.L: Friendliest Black Artist in America" was produced by curator Mark Bessire in conjunction with the retrospective exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Bessire, Mark H.C., William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America, MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts – London, England, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Pope.L received a [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists award. In 2004 he received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/11658-william-popel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509135323/http://www.gf.org/fellows/11658-william-popel |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 ''The Black Factory'', an art installation on wheels, traveled from Maine to Missouri as part of [[The Interventionists]] show organized by the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Mass MOCA). "Typically the Factory arrives at a city or town and sets up its interactive workshop on the street. People bring objects that represent blackness to them. The Factory’s workers use these objects in tightly rehearsed but loosely performed skits to stimulate a conversation — a flow of ideas, images and experiences. Most objects are photographed and made part of the Factory’s virtual library, some are housed in the Factory’s archive for later use, and some are pulverized in the Factory’s workshop to make new products available in the Factory’s gift shop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarystl.org/pro_blackfactory.php|title=Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis|website=Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he was selected as one of the United States Artists fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/USAFellows/2006Fellows/Alphabetically/WilliamPopeL/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914195558/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/USAFellows/2006Fellows/Alphabetically/WilliamPopeL/index.cfm |archivedate=2010-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was awarded a $50,000 unrestricted grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/About/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025053555/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/About/index.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was featured alongside other performing artists: [[Sean Penn]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Juliette Binoche]] in [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s [[LAB HD]] portraits. In 2008, Pope.L's piece "One Substance, Eight Supports, One Situation" was selected to participate in [[The Renaissance Society]]'s group exhibition, "Black Is, Black Ain't".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Intro.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.html The Renaissance Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142724/http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Intro.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.html |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Pope.L was appointed faculty at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dova.uchicago.edu/faculty/fac_pope.html|title=Core Faculty - Department of Visual Arts|website=dova.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent work==
In 2015 MOCA, Los Angeles presented ''Trinket'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moca.org/exhibition/william-popel-trinket|title=William Pope.L: Trinket|website=The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest solo museum presentation of Pope.L's work to date. The centerpiece of the show is ''Trinket'', a monumental, custom-made American flag (approximately 54 x 16 feet) hanging on a pole in the middle of the Geffen. During the museum's public hours the flag will be continuously blown by four large-scale industrial fans — the type used on Hollywood film sets to create wind or rain effects — and will be illuminated from below by a bank of custom theatrical lights. Over time the flag will appear to fray at its ends due to the constant whipping of the forced air, a potent metaphor for the rigors and complexities of democratic engagement and participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-pope-l-moca-review-20150324-column.html|title=William Pope.L sets the U.S. flag waving at the MOCA/Geffen|first=Christopher|last=Knight|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/words/id=50371|title=William Pope.L|website=artforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.theartnewspaper.com/articles/William-PopeL-wants-to-bring-down-the-house/37266 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906003611/http://old.theartnewspaper.com/articles/William-PopeL-wants-to-bring-down-the-house/37266 |archive-date=2015-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/william-popel-1/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409054455/http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/william-popel-1/ |date=2016-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trinket'' was originally produced in 2008 at [[Grand Arts]], in Kansas City, Mo., as the centerpiece of Pope.L's exhibition  Animal Nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandarts.com/past_projects/2008/2008_09.html|title=Grand Arts|website=grandarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015 Pope.L 	produced ''The Beautiful'', a new choreographed crawl performance staged for the first time at [[Art Basel]] in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/12/03/muscle-men-and-free-cash-xavier-cha-and-pope-l-shine-at-art-basels-public-sector/|title=Muscle Men and Free Cash: Xavier Cha and Pope.L Shine at Art Basel’s Public Sector|first=John|last=Chiaverina|date=3 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For ''The Beautiful'', four men, dressed as Superman with [[skateboards]] strapped to their backs, roll onward in the dark. The rumbling of their wheels grows louder through speakers as they approach the crowd, and blends with the low churning of electric guitars. The ‘Super-Gents’ reach a wooden stage and crab-walk their way up, barely fitting onto the small surface. Holding each other, they finally break into a heart-rending, soulful version of the patriotic song America The Beautiful.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Quotes==
Pope.L's art focuses on issues of consumption, social class, and masculinity as they relate to race. He is quoted as saying of his own work: “I am a fisherman of social absurdity, if you will…  My focus is to politicize disenfranchisement, to make it neut, to reinvent what’s beneath us, to remind us where we all come from.&lt;ref&gt;Bessire, Mark H.C., William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America, [[MIT Press]], Cambridge Massachusetts – London, England, 2002.pg.23&lt;/ref&gt;”

In his Foundation for [[Contemporary Arts]] Fellowship bio, he writes: "Like the African shaman who chews his pepper seeds and spits seven times into the air, I believe art re-ritualizes the everyday to reveal something fresh about our lives. This revelation is a vitality and it is a power to change the world.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_recipients/popel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018224957/http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_recipients/popel.html |archivedate=2008-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
