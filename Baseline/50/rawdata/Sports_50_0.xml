The '''1993 Cherbourg incident''' were a series of maritime incidents which took place from 26 March to 2 April 1993 between the British [[Royal Navy]] and French fishermen as a result of a [[Exclusive economic zone|fishing rights]] dispute in and around the [[Channel Islands]] waters.

== Background ==

The tensions around the Channel Islands waters rose high since September 1992, when the [[European Union]] (EU) recognised a six-mile British limit for [[Exclusive Economic Zone|exclusive fishing rights]] around the islands. Until then, British and French trawlers operated in the zone without restrictions.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; The agreement left a three-mile limit from the coastline where only [[Jersey]] trawlers could fish, between the three-mile and the six-mile for any British-flagged boat and an outer area between the six-mile and the 12-mile limit where only British and French fishing boats could operate.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt;

== The incidents ==

The first incident took place on 26 March, when two fishing inspectors from the Channel Islands were illegally taken on the trawler ''Impatiens'' to the French port of [[Barneville-Carteret]], after the French fishing boat was challenged by the British fishery vessel [[HMS Orkney (P299)|HMS ''Orkney'']] from [[Guernsey]],&lt;ref name=day/&gt; which confiscated her pots.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inspectors were rescued some hours later by a French coastguard vessel.&lt;ref name=surv&gt;British Information Services: Survey of current affairs: Volumen 23, 1993, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=day&gt;Daily report. West Europe, 1–15. United States. [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 1993, [[HMS Blazer (P279)|HMS ''Blazer'']] was paying a visit to [[Cherbourg]] when the local fishermen learned that a boat from their fleet, the ''La Calypso'', had been stopped at sea by a British minesweeper, [[HMS Brocklesby (M33)|HMS ''Brocklesby'']]. The captain of the ''La Calypso'' refused to submit and set out for Cherbourg with three British fishery protection servicemen on board. A French port vessel later returned the personnel to Royal Navy control. Eight French trawlers subsequently surrounded the ''Blazer''&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; at 3:00 pm and angry fishermen boarded the ship. According to witnesses,&lt;ref name=day/&gt; HMS ''Blazer'' was seized while manoeuvring outside the port and sailed to Cherbourg harbour by the intruders. Her crew of 16 were forced to remain below the deck for three hours, while the ship's [[White Ensign]]  was burned.  French authorities subsequently put an end to the situation and forcibly expelled the fishermen from ''Blazer'' and placed them under arrest. The [[French Navy]], meanwhile, dispatched the patrol boat ''Coriander'' to Cherbourg.&lt;ref name=burn&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/french-fishermen-burn-patrol-boats-ensign-minister-warns-navy-will-get-tough-after-two-new-humiliations-in-fishing-rights-dispute-1500601.html "French fishermen burn patrol boat's ensign: Minister warns Navy will get tough after two new humiliations in fishing rights dispute"]. ''The Independent'', 29 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March a flotilla of 36 French trawlers steamed up to [[Saint Peter Port]] in Guernsey, where a preliminary deal was agreed.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; After the first incidents, the Royal Navy deployed unarmed [[Royal Marines]] to conduct any future similar law enforcement operations. The marines were from 40 Commando, based at [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The ''La Calypso'' was eventually caught by the fishery vessel [[HMS Jersey (P295)|HMS ''Jersey'']] and her master was put under arrest in Guernsey on 2 April 1993.&lt;ref name=skip&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/french-skipper-under-arrest-in-guernsey-1453007.html "French skipper under arrest in Guernsey "].

''The Independent'', 4 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A new incident took place on 30 June 1993, when the Guernsey-based trawler ''Sara P'' was seized by the French Navy, and had her pots confiscated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== British and French reactions ==

A spokeswoman for the French fishermen accused the Royal Navy of "severe provocation", while the British [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|minister of Agriculture]], [[John Gummer]], stated that "The rule of law must be upheld. I have always emphasised the need for fisheries regulations to be properly enforced throughout the EC. The regulations are there to conserve fish and the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves."&lt;ref name=skip/&gt; The British Fisheries junior Minister, [[David Curry]], claimed that the conflict was caused by the French authorities' failure to properly inform their fishermen about the agreement sanctioned by the EU in 1992, and the [[French legislative election, 1993|French legislative election]], which in practice left no French government to deal with at the time of the incidents.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; The British Agriculture Minister had met his elected French counterpart on 1 April, and they had agreed that the 1992 EU decision should be enforced.&lt;ref name=skip/&gt; The French government condemned the fishermen's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-03-30/news/1993089075_1_british-channel-islands-french-fishermen-british-and-french Seizing of British officers by French fishing boat sends chill across channel] by Richard O'Mara. [[The Baltimore Sun]], 30 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; British and Cherbourg fishermen signed an informal agreement on 5 April, on the first day since the beginning of the crisis, that boats from England and the islands were allowed to unload their catch in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/fishermen-make-pact-friendly-overtures-as-british-catch-is-unloaded-in-france-1453579.html|title=Fishermen make 'pact': Friendly overtures as British catch is unloaded|date=1993-04-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A definitive agreement regarding fishing around the Channel Islands and the [[Contentin]] peninsula and [[Brittany]] was reached after an exchange of notes in Paris, on 16 August 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1995/TS0037.pdf|title = Exchange of notes constituting an agreement regarding activities by the local coastal fishermen in the vicinity of Guernsey and the French coasts of the Cotentin Peninsula and of Brittany.

The '''2018 Copa Libertadores Finals''' is the two-legged final to decide the winners of the [[2018 Copa Libertadores]], the 59th edition of the [[Copa Libertadores]], South America's premier international club [[association football|football]] tournament organised by [[CONMEBOL]].

The finals are being contested in two-legged home-and-away format between [[Argentine Football Association|Argentine]] clubs [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], making it the first [[Superclásico]] final of an international competition. The first leg was hosted by Boca Juniors at the [[La Bombonera|Estadio Alberto J. Armando]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina on 11 November 2018, while the second leg will take place outside South America at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] in [[Madrid]], Spain (a neutral venue) on 9 December 2018.&lt;ref name="dates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/las-finales-de-la-conmebol-libertadores-se-disputaran-el-10-y-24-de-noviembre|title=Las finales de la CONMEBOL Libertadores se disputarán el 10 y 24 de noviembre|publisher=CONMEBOL.com|date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/confirmados-los-horarios-y-fechas-de-los-partidos-finales-de-la-conmebol-libertadores-2018|title=Confirmados los horarios y fechas de los partidos finales de la CONMEBOL Libertadores 2018|publisher=CONMEBOL.com|date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the last final to take place over two legs, as starting from [[2019 Copa Libertadores|2019]] the final will be played as a single match at a venue chosen in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/la-conmebol-libertadores-se-definira-en-final-unica-partir-de-2019-con-mayores-beneficios-los-clubes|title=La CONMEBOL Libertadores se definirá en final única a partir de 2019 con mayores beneficios a los clubes y la competencia|publisher=CONMEBOL.com|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Histórica decisión: Final Única de la Libertadores 2019 en Santiago y Final Única de la Sudamericana 2019 en Lima |url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/historica-decision-final-unica-de-la-libertadores-2019-en-santiago-y-final-unica-de-la-sudamericana |publisher=CONMEBOL.com|date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the intense rivalry between Boca and River, the match has been referred to as the "'''Superfinal'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Dan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/boca-vs-river-copa-libertadores-2018-final-juniors-plate-preview-prediction-watch-video-a8625831.html |title=Boca vs River is the Copa Libertadores final Argentina has craved – but will the country cope with the carnage? |website=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=9 November 2018 |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second leg was originally to be hosted by River Plate at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina on 24 November 2018. However, due to safety concerns resulting from the attack on the bus of Boca Juniors prior to the match, the second leg was moved outside of Argentina and South America, later confirmed to be the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] in [[Madrid]], Spain.&lt;ref name="Madrid"/&gt; This will be the first time that the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final will be held in outside South America.

The winners of the 2018 Copa Libertadores will qualify as the CONMEBOL representative at the [[2018 FIFA Club World Cup]] in the United Arab Emirates, entering in the [[2018 FIFA Club World Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]]. They also will earn the right to play against the winners of the [[2018 Copa Sudamericana]] in the [[2019 Recopa Sudamericana]].&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conmebol.com/sites/default/files/reglamento-conmebol-libertadores-2018-espanol.pdf|title=Reglamento CONMEBOL Libertadores 2018|publisher=CONMEBOL.com|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winners also automatically qualify for the group stage of the [[2019 Copa Libertadores]].

For the third time, two teams from the same country will face each other in the final, after Brazilian teams met in the [[2005 Copa Libertadores Finals|2005]] and [[2006 Copa Libertadores Finals|2006]] finals. Therefore, it will be the first all-Argentine final of the Copa Libertadores, as well as the first final to feature two teams from the same city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stokkermans |first=Karel |url=http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/copalib.html |title=Copa Libertadores de América |website=RSSSF.com |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |date=17 July 2018 |access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 finals will mark the first time that the [[Superclásico]] is contested in the Copa Libertadores final (or any final of an international competition), and the third time that the two clubs have met in a cup final, after the [[1976 Argentine Primera División#Final|1976 Primera División final]] and the [[2017 Supercopa Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 November 2018 |title=Boca Juniors set up Copa Libertadores final Superclásico with rivals River Plate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/01/boca-juniors-set-up-copa-libertadores-final-superclasico-with-rivals-river-plate-football |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finals will be played on a home-and-away [[two-legged tie|two-legged]] basis, with the [[2018 Copa Libertadores final stages#Seeding|higher-seeded team]] ([[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]) originally planned to host the second leg.

The [[away goals rule]] will not be applied, and [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] will be played if the aggregate score is tied after the second leg. If the aggregate score is still tied after extra time, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] will be used to determine the winner. If extra time is played, a fourth substitution will be allowed.&lt;ref name="regulations"/&gt;

==Incidents==
The first leg of the final was originally scheduled for 7 November, with the second leg on 28 November 2018 (both on Wednesdays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/el-consejo-aprueba-con-cuatro-meses-de-antelacion-calendario-de-disputa-de-la-libertadores-y|title=El Consejo aprueba con cuatro meses de antelación calendario de disputa de la Libertadores y Sudamericana 2018|language=Spanish|publisher=CONMEBOL.com|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the finalists were known, CONMEBOL adjusted the dates, with the first leg (hosted by Boca Juniors, the lower seed) on 10 November and the second leg (hosted by River Plate, the higher seed) on 24 November (both Saturdays at 16:00 local time).&lt;ref name="dates"/&gt; The [[Argentine Football Association]] opposed the date change. Following discussion, the final was moved to 17:00 local time.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; The first leg was postponed less than two hours before kickoff due to Boca Junior's pitch at the [[La Bombonera|Estadio Alberto J. Armando]] being waterlogged due to local flooding.&lt;ref name="postponed"/&gt; The match was rescheduled for the following day, 11 November, with the kickoff moved to 16:00 local time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/nov/11/boca-juniors-river-plate-copa-libertadores-final-first-leg-live |title =Boca Juniors and River Plate draw 2-2 in Copa Libertadores final first leg|date=11 November 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;	

[[File:RiverPlateStadium.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, was originally to host the second leg, but the match was moved due to safety concerns.]]
Prior to the second leg of the final on 24 November, the Boca Juniors team bus was attacked en route to River Plate's stadium, the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]]. Multiple windows on the bus were broken after being hit by projectiles thrown from a crowd surrounding the bus, allowing [[pepper spray]] to enter the bus. Multiple players on the bus were injured as a result of the broken glass and pepper spray, with the match delayed by one hour to 18:00 local time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caron |first=Emily |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/11/24/boca-juniors-bus-attacked-copa-libertadores-final-vs-river-plates |title=Boca Juniors Bus Attacked En Route to El Monumental for Copa Libertadores Final |website=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=24 November 2018 |access-date=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kickoff was later moved to 18:20 local time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://redgol.cl/2018/11/la-frase-que-le-exploto-en-la-cara-al-arqu/ |title=La frase que le explotó en la cara al arquero de San Lorenzo en Temuco: "En Argentina eso no pasa" |trans-title=The phrase that exploded on the San Lorenzo goalkeeper's face in Temuco: "In Argentina that doesn't happen" |website=RedGol |date=24 November 2018 |access-date=24 November 2018 |language=Spanish |dead-url=no |archive-url=http://archive.is/4W2UM |archive-date=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again to 19:15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ar.marca.com/claro/futbol/copa-libertadores/final/2018/11/24/5bf9a420ca4741a0108b4634.html |title=El presidente de Conmebol confirma que la Superfinal se jugará a las 19:15 |trans-title=The president of CONMEBOL confirms that the Superfinal will be played at 19:15 |website=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]] |date=24 November 2018 |access-date=24 November 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; before once more being delayed until 19:30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fripp |first=Nicolás |url=https://970universal.com/2018/11/24/peligra-la-superfinal/ |title=Se posterga la superfinal |trans-title=Superfinal postponed |website=970universal.com |date=24 November 2018 |access-date=24 November 2018 |language=Spanish |dead-url=no |archive-url=http://archive.is/eXR4Y |archive-date=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the delays, the match was rescheduled for the following day, 25 November, with the same kickoff, 17:00 local time.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46332084 |title=Boca Juniors v River Plate in Copa Libertadores final postponed after bus attack |website=[[BBC Sport]] |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=24 November 2018 |access-date=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Boca Juniors and River Plate striker [[Gabriel Batistuta]] called the attacks "shameful".&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

On 25 November, prior to the rescheduled second leg, Boca Juniors requested that the match be postponed in order for it to be played under equal conditions, which was not met following the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/el-club/comu-18 |title=Comunicado de prensa |trans-title=Press release |website=[[Boca Juniors]] |date=25 November 2018 |access-date=25 November 2018 |language=Spanish |dead-url=no |archive-url=http://archive.is/MPTcD |archive-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CONMEBOL postponed the match once more as equal conditions were not guaranteed.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt; On 27 November, CONMEBOL confirmed the second leg would be played outside Argentina due to safety concerns, with the match taking place on 8 or 9 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/sports/copa-libertadores-final.html |title=All-Argentine Copa Libertadores Final to Be Played Outside Argentina |website=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=27 November 2018 |access-date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, on 29 November, CONMEBOL confirmed the match would take place at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] in [[Madrid]], Spain, on 9 December at 20:30 local time.&lt;ref name="Madrid"/&gt;

For security reasons, prior to the first leg, both clubs unanimously agreed to prohibit away fans from attending either match.&lt;ref name="ESPN-AP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/soccer/conmebol-copa-libertadores/story/3690951/copa-libertadores-away-fans-banned-for-river-plate-boca-juniors-final|title=Copa Libertadores: Away fans banned for River Plate-Boca Juniors final|publisher=ESPN|date=5 November 2018|access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, following the decision by CONMEBOL to move the second leg to Madrid, these plans were altered, with 5,000 tickets allocated to each club. Additionally, River Plate were reprimanded for the bus attack, fined $400,000, and ordered to play two games behind closed doors in the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/29/copa-libertadores-boca-juniors-river-plate-real-madrid-santiago-bernabeu-rescheduled|title=Postponed Copa Libertadores final to be played at Bernabéu in Madrid|author=Butler, Michael|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real Madrid will sell 25,000 tickets to fans of each team, as many Argentines work in Spain.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Security responsibilities for the second leg have been delegated to the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spanish football federation]], rather than CONMEBOL, with [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] claiming that plans are already underway to have the "necessary deployments to ensure the event is secure".&lt;ref name="Beeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46392340|title=Copa Libertadores: River Plate v Boca Juniors moved to Bernabeu in Madrid|publisher=BBC|date=29 November 2018|access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, additional concerns were reputedly raised by both clubs following the decision to move the game to Madrid. [[Leonardo Ponzio]], the River Plate captain, was allegedly involved in a [[match-fixing]] scandal during his time at [[Real Zaragoza]],&lt;ref name="Indian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/spanish-la-liga-2017-18/ander-herrera-atletico-madrid-captain-gabi-among-players-facing-prison-sentence-for-alleged-match-fixing-5064290/|title=Ander Herrera, Atletico Madrid captain Gabi among players facing prison sentence for alleged match fixing|publisher=Indian Express via Associated Press|access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such his eligibility to play football in Spain is unclear at present.&lt;ref name="Marca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol-internacional/copa-libertadores/final/2018/11/30/5c01737ce5fdea0c338b458a.html|title=Leonardo Ponzio, la preocupación de los abogados de River Plate|publisher=Marca|date=30 November 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, there are also reports that Boca Juniors intend to appeal the decision to relocate the second leg.&lt;ref name="L'Équipe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Boca-juniors-refuse-de-jouer-la-finale-retour-de-la-copa-libertadores-a-madrid/963792|title=Boca Juniors refuses to play the final return of the Copa Libertadores in Madrid|publisher=L'Équipe|language=French|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent press release, River Plate also announced an intent to protest the CONMEBOL decision to play in Madrid.&lt;ref name="RiverPlate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/comunicado-de-prensa-1-12|title=Comunicado de prensa del 1 de diciembre de 2018|language=Spanish|date=1 December 2018|publisher=CA River Plate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
After River Plate advanced to the final, [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] protested the result due to improper communication by [[MANAGER]] in the [[LINK|semi-final second leg]] after he received a suspension following the [[|semi-final first leg]]. While the protest was dismissed, MANAGER was suspended for X months from managing in CONMEBOL competitions, leaving him ineligible to coach the team during the finals. As a result, River Plate assistant manager [[NAME]] will take his place as manager.--&gt;

An '''altitude tent''' is a sealed tent used to simulate a higher altitude with reduced oxygen. The basic concept of living or training at altitude is to cause the body to adapt to the lower oxygen content by producing more oxygen-carrying red blood cells and hemoglobin. Training or spending time at a higher altitude will cause the body to adapt to the higher altitude and provide enhanced performance when returning to a lower altitude. Mountain climbers can use them to avoid [[altitude sickness]], and athletes can use them to enhance performance at lower altitudes.

==History==
Altitude tents were first marketed in the mid-1990s, and are provided by many different companies in a number of designs.

==Overview==
Sleeping in a simulated altitude environment allows the body to achieve some of the positive adaptations to altitude while still permitting the athlete to perform workouts at an oxygen-rich lower altitude where muscles can perform at their normal work level.&lt;ref&gt;https://hypoxico.com/sleeping-at-altitude/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hypoxico.com/exercising-at-altitude/&lt;/ref&gt; An altitude tent is one way to enable athletes living at any elevation to sleep in a high altitude-like environment. A more expensive option gaining popularity amongst professional athletes is to convert their entire bedroom to altitude.

===How Altitude Tents Work===
Rather than simulating altitude with actual low air pressure (which would require substantial engineering and the use of an airlock to prevent implosion), the altitude tent remains at the ambient air pressure, substituting low concentration of oxygen for low pressure.  While normal air contains 20.9% [[oxygen]] independent of altitude, the air in an altitude tent contains as little as 12% oxygen (the remainder being [[nitrogen]]). The [[partial pressure]] of oxygen inside the tent is the same as it is at the natural elevation that the tent is simulating.

Most altitude tents are normobaric&lt;ref&gt;/https://www.outsideonline.com/1784286/do-altitude-tents-work&lt;/ref&gt; which means they create a low-oxygen environment with a “hypoxic air generator” outside the tent pumping the hypoxic (low oxygen) air into the tent which replaces some of the oxygen with nitrogen&lt;ref&gt;https://www.outsideonline.com/1784286/do-altitude-tents-work&lt;/ref&gt;. The more oxygen-rich air inside the tent is displaced and with it, the excess [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the occupant(s). Most athletes use altitudes between 8,000 and 15,000 feet. To cause a physiological response, the altitude must be sufficient to reduce blood oxygen saturation (sometimes measured by a [[pulse oximeter]]) to approximately 90%.

In preparation to mountaineering, short-term use (1 week) of an altitude tent for overnight exposure (7.5 hours per night at 3000 m) prior to ascent to actual altitude can increase blood oxygen saturation during sleep and lessen symptoms of acute mountain sickness upon waking, but does not improve exercise performance at altitude &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21123763/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Different Types of Altitude Tents===
The tents themselves come in several styles. Unlike camping tents, altitude tents cannot have much ventilation and often substitute clear plastic windows for the typical nylon and mesh vents.  Displaced air escapes the tent through small outlets, seams, or zippers. Air delivery can be through hoses long enough to allow the generator to be placed in a different room, reducing noise.  Smaller tents are placed on the bed, with the floor of the tent between mattress and box springs. Larger tents are of a cube shape, often tall enough to stand up in, and set up on the floor with the entire bed, and often a nightstand or two, placed inside. One or more zippered doors allow the occupants to enter and exit with limited loss of effective altitude.

One challenge with altitude tents is the buildup of heat and humidity.  Because of the use of plastic panels to reduce exchange with the room, heat and humidity can build up in an altitude tent.  Some tents allow the use of air conditioners to maintain comfortable conditions. [[Carbon dioxide]] from the exhaled air can also build up to uncomfortable levels if air exchange is too low. In recent years, advances in altitude tent design, and in the performance of the hypoxic air-supply units, have all resulted in greater air-exchange and significantly lower noise levels.

===Alternative Options For Altitude Tents===
An alternative to the sealed altitude tent is the altitude canopy, which drapes over the user's bed, and features a weighted edge instead of a tent floor. The canopy maintains high altitude even though there may be small gaps around the edge by maintaining a high flow rate of hypoxic air through the canopy, effectively preventing room air from entering the gaps. By virtue of smaller internal volumes, canopies come to altitude faster than conventional altitude tents, however, the ever-changing barrier between the canopy and the bedding as the occupant moves during the night results in a less-stable altitude being simulated than with an enclosed tent.

==Debate==

The ethics of the use of these devices by athletes has been discussed by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), which claimed that it could be equivalent to [[blood doping]] and therefore they should be banned; however, on September 16, 2006, [[Dick Pound]] of the WADA announced that "...the overwhelming consensus of our health, medicine and research committees – was that, at this time, it is not appropriate to do so," &lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20427069-23218,00.html] The Australian September 17th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  No explanation was given as to how WADA would have enforced a ban.

The [[USADA]] report on doping in the [[Lance Armstrong]] case also indicates that sleeping in an altitude tent can be used to hide doping using [[Erythropoietin|EPO]], as natural Erythropoietin production is increased, confusing the tests.&lt;ref&gt;http://d3epuodzu3wuis.cloudfront.net/ReasonedDecision.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14201">The first [[Athlete of the Year]] award in the [[United States]] was initiated by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) in 1931. At a time when [[women's sports|women in sports]] were not given the same recognition as men, the AP offered a male and a female athlete of the year award to either a professional or amateur [[Sportsperson|athlete]]. The awards are voted on annually by a panel of AP sports editors from across the United States. A large majority of the winners have been Americans. However, non-Americans are also eligible for the honor, and have won on a few occasions.

The '''Barmy Army''' is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales. Its Registered address is Osbourne House, 143-145 Stanwell Road, Ashford, Middlesex TW15 3QN. The company provides tickets and arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the [[English cricket team]] in the UK and overseas. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The term "barmy" is English slang for "mad".

The group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1994-95|1994-1995]] [[Test cricket|Test]] series in [[Australia]], reportedly for the fans' hopeless audacity in travelling all the way to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting encouragement to the England team even when England were losing quite badly.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/dec/01/ashes2006.cricket7 Crass and corporate - why the Barmy Army are no laughing matter] 1 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-fight-back-against-the-barmy-army-427134.html Dominic Lawson: Fight back against the Barmy Army], The Independent, 5 Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by [[Paul Burnham]].&lt;ref name=itn /&gt;

==History==
The Barmy Army, which is now a limited company, states that it wants to "make watching cricket more fun and much more popular". The group uses [[flag]]s, [[banner]]s, [[song]]s and [[chant]]s to encourage the team and crowd participation in their activities. In contrast to the reputations of some sports fans for [[hooliganism]], the Barmy Army organisers actively discourage and avoid such behaviour.

The group engages in [[Charitable organization|charity]] work and has gained a good reputation among most cricket administrators. However, many cricket followers find their constant chanting to be annoying and disruptive, particularly during the afternoon sessions of Test matches when the chanting of the Barmy Army, fuelled by their consumption of large amounts of alcohol, often becomes a repetitive, irritating background noise; among others, the renowned cricket writer/commentator [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]] accused them of "demeaning English cricket".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Martin-Jenkins. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,426-1456636,00.html Vaughan's men reap dividends of bolder approach] [[The Times]], 26 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

"Barmy Army" was a [[football chant]] sung by fans at many grounds, originally sung at Hillsborough by [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the early 1980s. This was because [[Howard Wilkinson]], known as Sergeant Wilko, who was manager at the time inspired the chant, "Sergeant Wilko's Barmy Army".  In conjunction with the increasing appearance of English football shirts at cricket grounds in the early 1990s, the song's droning, repetitive cry of "Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army" transferred to domestic Test cricket arenas at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] and [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]]. It was particularly apparent during the 1993 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!--whole paragraph--&gt;
[[File:Barmy Army - The Gabba 2006.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The Barmy Army and police at [[the Gabba]], November 2006.]]

Throughout the 1990s, increased spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans to take the song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact that it seemed to represent English fans' activity of standing in the hot sun, drinking lager all day, until they were sunburnt and unwell, it became a description as well as a song. [[David Lloyd (cricketer)|David Lloyd]] and [[Ian Botham]] used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for [[Sky Sports]] during England's tours from 1993 to 1995.

Only in the mid-1990s was the tag recognised as an official title for English touring cricket fans and adopted by what is now recognised as the official Barmy Army.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

In the late 1990s performers [[Richard Stilgoe]] and [[Peter Skellern]] recognised the need for an anthem for the loyal supporters of a team that regularly seemed to lose and wrote a stirring song called "The Barmy Army" which they included in their touring repertoire. It can be found on their 1999 CD "A Quiet Night Out" and humorously celebrates the English team's skill at "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory".

The '''"Blood in the Water" match''' ({{lang-hu|melbourne-i vérfürdő}} lit. ''Blood bath of Melbourne''; {{lang-ru|Кровь в бассейне|Krov' v basseyne|Blood in the swimming pool}}) was a [[water polo]] match between [[Hungary men's national water polo team|Hungary]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national water polo team|USSR]] at the [[Water polo at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]]. The match took place on 6 December 1956 against the background of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], and saw Hungary defeat the USSR 4–0. The name was coined after Hungarian player [[Ervin Zádor]] emerged during the last two minutes with blood pouring from above his eye after being punched by Soviet player [[Valentin Prokopov]].

== Background ==
{{further|Hungarian Revolution of 1956}}

Tensions were already high between the Hungarian and Soviet water polo teams, as the Soviets had taken advantage of their political control of Hungary to study and copy the training methods and tactics of the Olympic champion Hungarians.&lt;ref name="guardianolysrs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/28/olympic-hungary-soviet-union-blood-water |title=50 stunning Olympic moments No7: Hungary v Soviet Union: blood in the water |date=December 28, 2011 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |author=Simon Burnton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on October 23, 1956, a demonstration by students of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] escalated into an uprising against the Soviet puppet government in Budapest. On November 1, Soviet tanks began rolling into Hungary and from November 4 to November 10 forces began suppressing the uprising with air strikes, artillery bombardments, and tank-infantry actions.

At the time, the Hungarian water polo team was in a mountain training camp above [[Budapest]]. They were able to hear the gunfire and see smoke rising. The players were the defending Olympic champions; with the Summer Olympics in [[Melbourne]] two months away, they were moved into [[Czechoslovakia]] to avoid being caught in the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/events/1996/olympics/daily/july28/flashback.html |publisher=''Sports Illustrated'' |author=Ron Fimrite |date=1996-07-28 |accessdate=2007-03-24 |title=A bloody war that spilled into the pool}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players only learned of the true extent of the uprising and the subsequent crackdown after arriving in Australia and they were all anxious for news of friends and family.

By the start of the Olympics, the uprising had been suppressed and many players saw the Olympics as a way to salvage pride for their country. "We felt we were playing not just for ourselves but for our whole country", said Zádor after the match. The match was played in front of a [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] crowd bolstered with expatriate Hungarians (many of whom had been in the boxing arena before to see the Hungarian [[László Papp]]) as well as Australians and Americans, two of the Soviet Union's [[Cold War]] opponents.

In the morning before the start, the Hungarians had created a strategy to taunt the Russians, whose language they had studied in school. In the words of Ervin Zádor: "We had decided to try and make the Russians angry to distract them."&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freedomsfury.net/press-kit/FFIndependent12-6-6.html |publisher=''The Independent'' |date=2006-12-02 |author=Mike Rowbottom |title=Ervin Zador: Blood in the water (interview) |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, kicks and punches were exchanged. At one point, a punch thrown by Hungarian captain [[Dezső Gyarmati]] was caught on film.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Meanwhile, Zádor scored two goals to the crowd's cheers of ''Hajrá Magyarok!'' ("Go Hungarians!").

By the final minutes of the match, Hungary was leading 4–0. Zádor was marking [[Valentin Prokopov]], with whom he had already exchanged words&lt;!--Who abusing who's family? Both?:, such as abusing his family--&gt;. Prokopov struck him, causing a bleeding gash. Zádor left the pool and his bleeding was the final straw for a crowd already in frenzy.  Many angry spectators jumped onto the concourse beside the water, shook their fists, shouted abuse and spat at the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/175-years/cold-war-violence-erupts-at-melbourne-olympics/2006/04/17/1145126047088.html |title=Cold War violence erupts at Melbourne Olympics |date=1956-12-07 |publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald'' |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/91229261 Riot Narrowly Avoided at Olympic Pool, ''The Canberra Times'', (Friday, 7 December 1956), p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olympic Games Peace Shattered: Fists Fly in Pool Fracas, ''The Argus'', (Friday, 7 December 1956), pp.[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/6563494 1,][http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/6563496 3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1BVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6172%2C957201 Hungarian Injured in Polo, ''The Age'', (Friday, 7 December 1956), p.1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1BVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3048%2C957904 Player Punched in Rough Water Polo, ''The Age'', (Friday, 7 December 1956), p.1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;That evening, a similar anti-Russian protest occurred during a fencing match between Hungarian [[Pál Kovács]] and Russian [[Lev Kuznetsov (fencer)|Lev Kuznetsov]] at the St Kilda Town Hall: [http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71770143 Mr. Brundage hears crowd hoot Russian, ''The Argus'', (Friday, 7 December 1956), p.14;] [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1BVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2111%2C1017223 Tireless Hungarian Takes Sabre Title: Appeal to Crowd, ''The Age'', Friday, 7 December 1956), p.12.]&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid a riot, police entered the arena and shepherded the crowd away.

Pictures of Zádor's injuries were published around the world, leading to the "Blood in the Water" moniker. Reports that the water in the pool turned red were, however, an exaggeration. Zádor said his only thought was whether he would be able to play the next match.

Hungary was declared the winner since they had been leading and then beat [[Yugoslavia]] 2–1 in the final to win their fourth Olympic gold medal. Zádor's injury would force him to miss the match. After the event was completed, he and some of his teammates sought [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the West, rather than returning to live in a Hungary under a firmly pro-Soviet regime.&lt;ref name="guardianolysrs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/91229428 Nine Hungarians Miss First Plane for Home, ''The Canberra Times'', (Saturday, 8 December 1956), p.3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kVBVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3591%2C1411863 Hungarians Stay Behind, ''The Age'', (Monday, 10 December 1956), p.1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71770513 46 Hungarians Refuse to go Home, and  . . .

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

In 2006, for the 50th anniversary of the attempted Hungarian Revolution, the documentary ''[[Freedom's Fury]]'', produced by Kristine Lacey and [[Thor Halvorssen Mendoza|Thor Halvorssen]], told the story of the match. [[Quentin Tarantino]] described it as "the best untold story ever".  The documentary was narrated by the legendary Olympic swimmer [[Mark Spitz]], who, as a teenager had been coached by Ervin Zádor.

Also in 2006, a feature film about the match was released, entitled ''[[Children of Glory]]'' (Hungarian title: ''Szabadság, szerelem'', meaning "Freedom, love", after the lines of [[Sándor Petőfi]], the martyred poet of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848–49 revolution]]). The movie shows the Hungarian Revolution through the eyes of a player on the water polo team and a young woman who is one of the student leaders. It was directed by [[Krisztina Goda]], and produced by [[Andrew G. Vajna]]. The movie appeared in Hungarian cinemas on 23 October 2006, the 50th anniversary of the revolution. On 29 October 2006, it was shown at the [[White House]] for President [[George W. Bush]] and guests (including Hungarian-American figures such as [[George Pataki]], Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[George A. Olah]], [[Nobel Prize]] winner).

The incident also features in the 1978 Australian film ''[[Newsfront]]''.

In September 2015, the CEO and founder Ryan DeLuca stepped down from his role, announcing he would be succeeded on an interim basis by Liberty Media CFO Chris Shean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article40650900.html|title=Bodybuilding.com founder DeLuca steps down|last=|first=|date=5 October 2015|website=Idaho Statesman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bodybuilding.com grew out of wholesale-creatine.com, an online storefront created by teenage web marketer and amateur bodybuilder Ryan DeLuca in 1997, to capitalize on the rising popularity of [[creatine supplement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLuca|first1=Ryan|title=Ask a guy who started Bodybuilding.com anything, part I|url=http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=7224141&amp;p=128278351#post128278351|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleCatching Up with the 2006 30 Under 30 Alumni, Leading Your Company Article - Inc.

While teenbodybuilding.com flourished with articles and writings by some of the most successful teen bodybuilders of the time like [[Layne Norton]], Anthony Church, and others, it was eventually merged into the primary domain name, bodybuilding.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLuca|first1=Ryan|title=Ask a guy who started Bodybuilding.com anything, part III|url=http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=7224141&amp;p=128280951#post128280951|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Church|first1=Anthony|title=About Fitness Expert Anthony Church|url=http://anthonychurchfitness.com/about|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of rapid growth, a majority stake in Bodybuilding.com was acquired in July 2006 by Milestone Partners for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestone Completes Sale of Bodybuilding.com|url=http://www.milestonepartners.com/News/Milestone-News/2008/Milestone-Completes-Sale-of-Bodybuilding-com|website=Milestone Partners|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Inc.

===Misidentified drugs===
In 2007, an FDA agent purchased several dietary supplements from the company which were determined to contain anabolic steroids. In May 2012, Bodybuilding.com was fined $7 million, and as part of the settlement, CEO DeLuca and his brother Jeremy were both fined $600,000 for selling misbranded drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Bill|title=Bodybuilding.com agrees to pay $7 million fine for violating Food and Drugs act|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2012/05/09/2109572/bodybuildingcom-agrees-to-pay.html|publisher=Idaho Statesman|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/CriminalInvestigations/ucm305494.htm|title=US FDA Criminal Investigations- May 22, 2012: Bodybuilding.com, LLC, Ryan Deluca, and Jeremy DeLuca Plead Guilty in Federal Court to Violating FDCA|accessdate =2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bud Light Daredevils''' were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998.  The show combined gymnastics, trampoline, acrobatics, and basketball.  The team was started by [[University of Mississippi]] cheerleaders [[Ty Cobb (cheerleader)|Ty Cobb]], Sam Martin, Robert Kirby, Tyler Hubbard, John White, and Ty Cobb's younger brother [[Guy Cobb]].

[[File:Ole Miss Cheerleaders at Houston Rockets.jpg|thumb|Ole Miss cheerleaders (including [[Colonel Reb]]) performing as the halftime entertainment during a Houston Rockets game]]
In 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as [[Ole Miss Rebels]] mascot [[Colonel Reb]]) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic "flip dunk" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games.

In 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini-trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games.

With the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called "The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the "Ole Miss Cheerleaders" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in 1980, followed by shows for the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]].

Still in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother [[Guy Cobb]] joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the "flip-pass" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk ("Congo Dunk" 1987).

==The Dixie Daredevils (1983–84)==
[[File:The Dixie Daredevils.jpg|thumb|left|Brothers Ty and [[Guy Cobb]] performing with Steve Cliffe as "The Dixie Daredevils" in a grocery store parking lot (Summer 1983).]]
Following his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13]

In 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of "Dixie Daredevils". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14]

In the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14]

During the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and [[Guy Cobb]] performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called "Budweiser Light".[2]

==The Bud Light Daredevils (1984–1998)==
[[File:Guy Cobb Bud Light Daredevils.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guy Cobb]] performing with the Bud Light Daredevils in 1987.]] 
Both Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer "Budweiser Light" to "Bud Light". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15]

From 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10]

Anheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7104">In baseball, a '''[[Captain (sports)|captain]]''' is an honorary title sometimes given to a member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by [[Manager (baseball)|managers]] and [[Coach (baseball)|coaches]], such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, and encouraging teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dickson | first=Paul | title=The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary | publisher=Mariner Books | year=1999 | page=101 | isbn=0-15-600580-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players and to encourage teamwork and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=ASEP | title=Coaching Baseball: Technical and Tactical Skills | publisher=Human Kinetics | year=2005 | page=240 | isbn=0-7360-4703-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major League Baseball]]'s official rules only briefly mention the position of team captain.  Official Baseball Rule 4.03 Comment (formerly Rule 4.01 Comment) which discusses the submission of a team's lineup to the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], notes that obvious errors in the lineup should be brought to the attention of the team's manager or captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Official Baseball Rules | date=1949–2010 | publisher=Major League Baseball | page=32 | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Major League Baseball, only a handful of teams have designated a player as captain in recent years, and there are no current team captains. [[Jerry Remy]], who was named as captain of the [[California Angels]] in 1977 at age 24, explains that in today's modern age of baseball, "there's probably no need for a captain on a major league team.  I think there are guys who lead by example.  You could name the best player on your team as captain, but he may not be the guy other players will talk to or who will quietly go to other players and give them a prod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Remy | first=Jerry |author2=Corey Sandler | title=Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game Within the Game | publisher=Globe Pequot | year=2006 | page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not wear an [[National Hockey League|NHL]]-style "C" on their jersey. Retired first baseman [[Mike Sweeney]], former captain of the [[Kansas City Royals]] from 2003 to 2007, wore the "C" patch, as did two other recently retired captains: [[John Franco]] of the Mets, and [[Jason Varitek]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th century, the captain held most of the on-field responsibilities that are held by managers and coaches in modern baseball.  For example, according to the 1898 official rules, the captain was responsible for assigning the players' positions and batting order, for appealing to the umpire if he observed certain violations (for example, if the other team intentionally discolored the ball or its players illegally left the bench), and for informing the umpire of any special ground rules. During a period when teams didn't carry full-time coaches, the captain and one or more other players could serve as "coachers" of the base runners; the lines setting off the section where they were allowed to stand were designated as "captain's lines." If the umpire made a decision that could "be plainly shown by the code of rules to have been illegal", the "captain alone shall be allowed to make the appeal for reversal."  The rules state that the captain must be one of the nine players, implying that a non-playing manager would not have been allowed to act in the captain's role. In contrast with modern baseball, the 1898 rules do not mention the managers having any rights to interact with the umpires. The rules allowed managers to sit on the team's bench during the game, but were otherwise silent with respect to rights and responsibilities of managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chadwick | first=Henry | title=Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide: 1898 | publisher=American Sports Publishing Company | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIdLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22base%20ball%22%20captain%20manager&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q=%22base%20ball%22%20captain%20manager&amp;f=false  | pages=169–171, 175, 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early baseball, many teams had playing managers who had both the off-field responsibilities of managers and the on-field responsibilities of captains.  They held the title of "manager-captain."&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1902 the newspapers refer to "Captain-Manager [[John McGraw]] and [[Joe Kelley]]"; see {{cite news | title=M'Graw at Polo Grounds: Six of the New York Baseball Team Are Released | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 18, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/07/18/117979853.pdf }} and {{cite news | title=Yesterday's Baseball Games: New York and Cincinnati Teams Each Win a Game at the Polo Grounds—Brooklyn Won | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 14, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/08/14/101962901.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, teams that had non-playing managers hired a player to serve as captain. For example, in early 1902 [[Jack Doyle (baseball)|Jack Doyle]] was signed as captain and first baseman of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] while non-player [[Horace Fogel]] was manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Doyle Signed by New York: Famous Baseball Player to Captain the Team and Play First Base—Pleased with the Club's Outlook | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 27, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/02/27/101939155.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the role of a captain has been significant in the histories of teams such as the [[New York Yankees]], the [[Boston Red Sox]], and the [[San Francisco Giants]], other teams, such as the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], have, as of 2016, never had a captain.

A '''chess prodigy''' is a child who can beat experienced adult players, and even Masters, at [[chess]]. Expectations can be high for chess prodigies. While some become [[World Chess Championship|World Champions]], others show little or no progress in adulthood.

==Early chess prodigies==

Early chess prodigies were [[Paul Morphy]] (1837–1884) and [[José Raúl Capablanca]] (1888–1942), both of whom won matches against strong adult opponents at the age of 12, and [[Samuel Reshevsky]] (1911–1992), who was giving [[simultaneous exhibition]]s at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2858|title=Chess prodigies and mini-grandmasters|date=10 January 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphy went on to be unofficial World Champion (before the official title existed), Capablanca became the third World Champion, and Reshevsky—while never attaining the title—was amongst the top few players in the world for many decades.

==List of youngest grandmasters==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Grandmaster (chess)]] --&gt;

One measure of chess prodigies (since 1950, when the title was introduced) is the age at which they gain the [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title. Below are players who have held the record for youngest grandmaster. The record has been held by [[Sergey Karjakin]] (then Ukraine) since 2002. The age listed is the age at which they [[Norm (chess)#Grandmaster norm|qualified for the title]]. This is not equal to the age at which they officially became Grandmasters, because GM titles can only be awarded at [[FIDE]] congresses.  

Note: all players are listed by their nationality at the time of gaining the title, not their current or later nationality.

The '''Cod Wars''' ({{lang-is|Þorskastríðin}}, "the cod wars", or ''Landhelgisstríðin'', "the wars for the territorial waters"&lt;ref&gt;The [[Icelandic Coast Guard]]'s name in Icelandic directly translates to "Territorial waters Guard".&lt;/ref&gt;) were a series of confrontations between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Iceland]] on [[Exclusive economic zone|fishing rights]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. Each of the disputes ended with an Icelandic victory.&lt;ref name="Habeeb1988"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power and Tactics in International Negotiations: How Weak Nations Bargain with Strong Nations|last = Habeeb|first = William|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1988|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; The Third Cod War concluded in 1976, with a highly favourable agreement for Iceland; the United Kingdom conceded to a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on|abbr=off}} Icelandic exclusive fishery zone after threats that Iceland would withdraw from [[NATO]], which would have forfeited NATO's access to most of the [[GIUK gap]], a critical [[anti-submarine warfare]] {{Linktext|chokepoint}} during the [[Cold War]].

Fishermen from Britain began to fish in the international waters near Iceland in the 15th century. From the early 16th century onward, English sailors and fishermen were a major presence in the waters off Iceland.&lt;ref name="Þorsteinsson1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|year = 1995|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Icelandic historians view the history of Iceland's struggle for control of its maritime resources in ten episodes, or ten cod wars. The first episode was a dispute between [[Norway]] and England in 1415 to 1425 over England's trading with Iceland in violation of Norway's monopoly on the Icelandic trade. The dispute ended when the English arrested [[Eric of Pomerania]]'s officials in Iceland, effectively restoring the Anglo-Icelandic trade. The agreement that was reached in 1976 concluded what in modern times is called the Third Cod War (the final and tenth Cod War in long-term history).&lt;ref name="Þorsteinsson1976"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tíu þorskastríð 1415–1976|last = Þorsteinsson|first = Björn|year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increases in range of fishing that were enabled by [[steam engine|steam power]] in the late 19th century, boat owners and skippers felt pressure to exploit new grounds. Their large catches in Icelandic waters attracted more regular voyages across the [[North Atlantic]]. In 1893, the [[Danish government]], which then governed Iceland and the [[Faroe Islands]], claimed a fishing limit of {{convert|50|nmi|km|abbr=on}} around their shores. British trawler owners disputed the claim and continued to send their ships to the waters near Iceland. The British government did not recognise the Danish claim on the grounds that setting such a precedent would lead to similar claims by the nations around the [[North Sea]], which would damage the British fishing industry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1896, the United Kingdom made an agreement with Denmark for British vessels to use any Icelandic port for shelter if they stowed their gear and trawl nets. In return, British vessels were not to fish in [[Faxa Bay]] east of a line from Ílunýpa, a promontory near [[Keflavík]] to Þormóðssker ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=64.4334_N_-22.3092_E_ 43.43° N, 22.30° W]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

With many British trawlers being charged and fined by Danish gunboats for fishing illegally within the {{convert|13|nmi|km|abbr=on|0}} limit, which the British government refused to recognise, the [[British press]] began to enquire why the Danish action against British interests was allowed to continue without intervention by the [[Royal Navy]]. The British made a show of naval force ([[gunboat diplomacy]]) in 1896 and 1897.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In April 1899, the steam trawler ''Caspian'' was fishing off the Faroe Islands when a Danish [[gunboat]] tried to arrest her for allegedly fishing illegally inside the limits. The trawler refused to stop and was fired upon first with blank shells and then with live ammunition. Eventually, the trawler was caught, but before the skipper, Charles Henry Johnson, left his ship to go aboard the Danish gunboat, he ordered the mate to make a dash for it after he went on to the Danish ship. The ''Caspian'' set off at full speed. The gunboat fired several shots at the unarmed boat but could not catch up with the trawler, which returned, heavily damaged, to [[Grimsby]], [[England]]. On board the Danish gunboat, the skipper of the ''Caspian'' was lashed to the mast. A court held at [[Thorshavn]] convicted him on several counts including illegal fishing and attempted assault, and he was jailed for 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Bale, B. (2010), ''Memories of the: Lincolnshire Fishing Industry'' Berkshire: Countryside Books pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Danish Territorial Waters Agreement of 1901, which set {{convert|3|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} territorial limits, measured narrowly, for Iceland for 50 years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 543–574|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic fisheries grew in importance for the British fishing industry around the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The reduction in fishing activity brought about by the hostilities of the [[First World War]] effectively ended the dispute for a time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

While data is incomplete for the prewar period, one historian argues that the Icelandic fishing grounds were 'very important' to the British fishing industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 1919 to 1938 showed a significant increase in the British total catches in Icelandic waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 68, 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British catches in Iceland were more than twice the combined catches of all other grounds of the British distant water fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelanders grew increasingly dismayed at the British presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British trawlers and Iceland: 1919–1976|last = Thór|first = Jón Th.|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 91–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1949–1958 ===
In October 1949, Iceland initiated the two-year abrogation process of the agreement made between Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1901. The fishery limits to the north of Iceland were extended to {{convert|4|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}. However, since the British trawling fleet did not use those ground, the northern extension was not a source of significant contention between the two states. Initially planning to extend the rest of its fishery limits by the end of the two-year abrogation period, Iceland chose to postpone its extension to wait for the outcome of the [[fisheries case|UK-Norway fisheries case]] in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which was decided in December 1951.

Icelanders were satisfied with the ICJ ruling, as they believed that Iceland's preferred extensions were similar to those afforded to Norway in the ICJ ruling. The UK and Iceland tried to negotiate a solution but were unable to reach agreement. The Icelandic government declared, on 19 March 1952, its intention to extend its fishery limits on 15 May 1952.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007" /&gt;

Iceland and the United Kingdom were involved in a dispute from May 1952 to November 1956 over Iceland's unilateral extension of its fishery limits from {{convert|3|to|4|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}. Unlike in the Cod Wars, the Royal Navy was never sent into Icelandic waters. The British trawling industry, however, implemented costly sanctions on Iceland by imposing a landing ban on Icelandic fish in British ports.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Troubled Waters|last = Jóhannnesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = NAFHA|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Cod and the Cold War|last = Guðmundsson|first = Guðmundur J.|date = 2006|journal = Scandinavian Journal of History|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing ban was a major blow to the Icelandic fishing industry (the UK was Iceland's largest export market for fish) and caused consternation among Icelandic statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Troubled Waters|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = |year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Utanríkisþjónusta Íslands og utanríkismál: Sögulegt Yfirlit 1.|last = Thorsteinsson|first = Pétur|publisher = |year = 1992|isbn = |location = |pages = 440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two sides decided to refer one part of the Icelandic extension to the ICJ in early 1953: the controversial Faxa Bay delimitation.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007" /&gt;

[[Cold War]] politics proved favourable for Iceland, as the [[Soviet Union]], seeking influence in Iceland, stepped in to purchase Icelandic fish. The [[United States]], fearing greater Soviet influence in Iceland, also did so and persuaded [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Í eldlínu kalda stríðsins|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|year = 1996|page = 288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Soviet and American involvement resulted in weakening the punitive effects of the British landing ban. Some scholars refer to the dispute of 1952 to 1956 as one of the Cod Wars, as the object of the dispute and its costs and risks were all similar to those in the other three Cod Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Þorskastríð og fjöldi þeirra|last = Þorsteinsson|first = Björn|date = 1983|journal = Saga|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tíunda þorskastríðið 1975–1976|last = Jónsson|first = Björn|date = 1981|journal = Saga|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Why Did the Cod Wars Occur and Why Did Iceland Win Them?

Just as the other Cod Wars, the dispute ended with Iceland achieving its aims, as the Icelandic {{convert|4|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} fishery limits were recognized by the United Kingdom, following a decision by the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation in 1956.&lt;ref name="Jóhannnesson2007" /&gt;

Two years later, in 1958, the [[United Nations]] convened the first [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea#UNCLOS I|International Conference on the Law of the Sea]], which was attended by 86 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, 1958|url=http://legal.un.org/diplomaticconferences/lawofthesea-1958/lawofthesea-1958.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries sought to extend the limits of their territorial waters to {{convert|12|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}, but the conference did not reach any firm conclusions.&lt;ref name="NationalArchives"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Cod Wars|url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/cod-wars.htm|publisher = The National Archives|accessdate = 4 November 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Icy fishing: UK and Iceland fish stock disputes|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06511/SN06511.pdf|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=27 February 2016|date=19 December 2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN1998"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (A historical perspective)|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Cod War lasted from 1 September 1958 to 11 March 1961.&lt;ref name="Þorskastríðin2006"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = Hafréttarstofnun Íslands|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It began as soon as a new [[Icelandic law]] came into force and expanded the Icelandic fishery zone from {{convert|4|to|12|nmi|km}} at midnight on 1 September 1958.

All members of NATO opposed the unilateral Icelandic extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Í eldlínu kalda stríðsins|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British declared that their trawlers would fish under protection from their [[warship]]s in three areas: out of the [[Westfjords]], north of Horn and southeast of Iceland. In all, twenty British trawlers, four warships and a supply vessel were inside the newly declared zones. The deployment was expensive; in February 1960, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], responsible for the [[Royal Navy]], stated that the ships near Iceland had expended half a million pounds sterling worth of oil since the new year and that a total of 53 British warships had taken part in the operations.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinn Sæmundsson, ''Guðmundur skipherra Kjærnested'', Örn og Örlygur. [[Reykjavík]]. 1984. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Against that, Iceland could deploy seven patrol vessels&lt;ref&gt;Jón Björnsson, ''Íslensk skip''. vol. III. Reykjavik. 1990 p. 8-142 {{ISBN|9979-1-0375-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a single [[PBY Catalina|PBY-6A Catalina]] [[flying boat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Svipmyndir úr 70 ára sögu''. Landhelgisgæsla Íslands.

The deployment of the Royal Navy to contested waters led to protests in Iceland. Demonstrations against the British embassy were met with taunts by the British ambassador, Andrew Gilchrist, as he played bagpipe music and military marches on his [[Phonograph|gramophone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 567–568|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many incidents followed. The Icelanders were, however, at a disadvantage in patrolling the contested waters because of the size of the area and the limited number of patrol ships. According to one historian, 'only the flagship Thór could effectively arrest and, if necessary, tow a trawler to harbour'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 559|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jóhannesson|first1=Guðni Th.|title=Did He Matter?

On 4 September [[ICGV Ægir|ICGV ''Ægir'']], an Icelandic patrol vessel, attempted to take a British trawler off the Westfjords but was thwarted when [[HMS Russell (F97)|HMS ''Russell'']] intervened, and the two vessels collided. On 6 October, V/s ''María Júlía'' fired three shots at the trawler ''Kingston Emerald'', forcing the trawler to escape to sea. On 12 November, V/s ''Þór'' encountered the trawler ''Hackness'', which had not stowed its nets legally. ''Hackness'' did not stop until ''Þór'' had fired two blanks and one live shell off its bow. Once again, HMS ''Russell'' came to the rescue, and its [[captain (nautical)|shipmaster]] ordered the Icelandic [[captain (naval)|captain]] to leave the trawler alone, as it was not within the {{convert|4|nmi|km|abbr=on}} limit recognised by the British government. The captain of ''Þór''', Eiríkur Kristófersson, said that he would not do so and ordered his men to approach the trawler with the gun manned. In response, the ''Russell'' threatened to sink the Icelandic boat if it fired a shot at the ''Hackness''. More British ships then arrived, and the ''Hackness'' retreated.

Icelandic officials threatened to withdraw Iceland's membership of NATO and to expel US forces from Iceland unless a satisfactory conclusion could be reached to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Í eldlínu kalda stríðsins|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the cabinet members who were pro-Western (proponents of NATO and the US Defence Agreement) were forced to resort to the threats, as that was Iceland's chief leverage, and it would have been [[political suicide]] not to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Uppgjör við umheiminn|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 33, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, NATO engaged in formal and informal mediations to bring an end to the dispute.&lt;ref name="Bakaki 63–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakaki|first=Zorzeta|date=2016-01-01|title=Deconstructing Mediation: A Case Study of the Cod Wars|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nejo.12147/abstract|journal=Negotiation Journal|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=63–78|doi=10.1111/nejo.12147|issn=1571-9979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal was very similar to one that Iceland had offered in the weeks and days leading up to its unilateral extension in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How 'cod war' came: the origins of the Anglo-Icelandic fisheries dispute, 1958–61*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x/abstract|journal = Historical Research|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 1468-2281|pages = 557, 562|volume = 77|issue = 198|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2004.00222.x|first = Gudni Thorlacius|last = Jóhannesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that any future disagreement between Iceland and Britain in the matter of fishery zones would be sent to the [[International Court of Justice]], in [[the Hague]].

[[File:Klippuemployment.png|thumb|200px|left|The primary objective of the Icelandic Coast Guard during the last two Cod Wars was to cut nets in this manner.]]

The Second Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland lasted from September 1972 until the signing of a temporary agreement, in November 1973.

The Icelandic government again extended its fishing limits, now to {{convert|50|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}. It had two goals in extending the limits: (1) to conserve fish stocks and (2) to increase its share of total catches.&lt;ref name="Hart1976"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Anglo-Icelandic Cod War of 1972–1973|last = Hart|first = Jeffrey A.|publisher = University of California|year = 1976|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 19, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons that Iceland pursued 50 nmi fishery limits, rather than the 200 nmi limits that they had also considered, were that the most fruitful fishing grounds were within the 50 nmi and that patrolling a 200 nmi limit would have been more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=5364327|title = Þorskar í köldu stríði|last = Guðmundsson|first = Guðmundur J.|date = 2000|journal = Ný saga|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British contested the Icelandic extension with two goals in mind: (1) to achieve the greatest possible catch quota for British fishermen in the contested waters and (2) to prevent a ''de facto'' recognition of a unilateral extension of a fishery jurisdiction, which would set a precedent for other extensions.&lt;ref name="Hart1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icelandic Fisheries|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/mar/22/icelandic-fisheries|website=Commons and Lords Hansard, the Official Report of debates in Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=22 March 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Western European states and the [[Warsaw Pact]] opposed Iceland's unilateral extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Uppgjör við umheiminn|last = Inimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 146, 162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; African states declared support for Iceland's extension after a meeting in 1971 where the Icelandic prime minister argued that the Icelandic cause was a part of a broader battle against colonialism and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Uppgjör við umheiminn|last = Ingimundarson|first = Valur|publisher = |year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1972, the enforcement of the law that expanded the Icelandic fishery limits to {{convert|50|nmi|km|abbr=on}} began. Numerous British and West German trawlers continued fishing within the new zone on the first day. The Icelandic leftist coalition then governing ignored the treaty that stipulated the involvement of the [[International Court of Justice]]. It said that it was not bound by agreements made by the previous centre-right government, with [[Lúdvik Jósepsson]], the fisheries minister, stating that 'the basis for our independence is economic independence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEiMDdxtSeA&amp;feature=related/ |title=Interview by the BBC in 1973 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=5 December 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ICGV ''Ægir'' chased 16 trawlers, in waters east of the country, out of the 50&amp;nbsp;nmi zone. The [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] started to use [[net cutter (fisheries patrol)|net cutters]] to cut the trawling lines of non-Icelandic vessels fishing within the new exclusion zone.

On 5 September 1972, at 10:25,&lt;ref name="Sæmundsson"&gt;Sæmundsson, Sveinn (1984). ''Guðmundur skipherra Kjærnested''.  Örn og Örlygur&lt;/ref&gt; ICGV ''Ægir'', under [[Guðmundur Kjærnested]]'s command, encountered an unmarked trawler fishing northeast of [[Hornbanki]]. The master of the black-hulled trawler refused to divulge the trawler's name and number and, after being warned to follow the Coast Guard's orders, played ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'' over the radio.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt; At 10:40, the net cutter was deployed into the water for the first time, and ''Ægir'' sailed along the trawler's port side. The fishermen tossed a thick nylon rope into the water as the [[OPV (naval)|patrol ship]] closed in, attempting to disable its propeller. After passing the trawler, ''Ægir'' veered to the trawler's starboard side. The net cutter, {{convert|160|fathom|m|lk=on}} behind the patrol vessel, sliced one of the trawling wires. As ICGV ''Ægir'' came about to circle the unidentified trawler, its angry crew threw coal as well as waste and a large fire axe at the Coast Guard vessel.&lt;ref name="Sæmundsson"/&gt; A considerable amount of swearing and shouting came through the radio, which resulted in the trawler being identified as [[Peter Scott (H103)|''Peter Scott'' (H103)]].&lt;ref name="Sæmundsson"/&gt;

On 25 November 1972, a crewman on the German trawler ''Erlangen'' suffered a head injury as an Icelandic patrolship cut the trawler's trawling wire, which struck the crewman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 1973, the nets of 18 trawlers were cut. That forced the British seamen to leave the Icelandic fishery zone unless they had the protection of the [[Royal Navy]]. The next day large, fast [[tugboat]]s were sent to their defence, the first being the ''Statesman''. The British considered that to be insufficient and formed a special group to defend the trawlers.

On 23 January 1973, the volcano [[Eldfell]] on [[Heimaey]] erupted, forcing the Coast Guard to divert its attention to rescuing the inhabitants of the small island.

On 17 May 1973, the British trawlers left the Icelandic waters, only to return two days later when they were escorted by British frigates.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006"/&gt; The naval deployment was codenamed Operation Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Stakes: Britain's Air Arms in Action 1945-1990|last=Flintham|first=Vic|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2008|isbn=1844158152|location=|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]] jets flew over the contested waters and notified British frigates and trawlers of the whereabouts of Icelandic patrolships.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 90"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelandic statesmen were infuriated by the entry of the Royal Navy and considered to appeal to the UN Security Council or call for Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty|NATO Charter]] to be implemented. According to the American ambassador at the time, [[Frederick Irving]], [[Ólafur Jóhannesson]] demanded for the US to send jets to bomb the British frigates.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 90"/&gt; There were major protests in Reykjavík on 24 May 1973. All the windows of the British embassy in Reykjavík were broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic lighthouse tender V/s ''Árvakur'' collided with four British vessels on 1 June, and six days later ICGV ''Ægir'' collided with [[HMS Scylla (F71)|HMS ''Scylla'']], when it was reconnoitring for icebergs off the Westfjords even though no trawlers were present.

On 29 August&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napier-chronicles.co.uk/1973.htm |title=1973 |publisher=The Napier Chronicles |date= |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Icelandic Coast Guard suffered the only fatality of the conflict, when ICGV ''Ægir'' collided with another British frigate. Halldór Hallfreðsson, an engineer on board the Icelandic vessel, died by electrocution from his welding equipment after sea water flooded the compartment in which he was making hull repairs.&lt;ref name=eng/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Anglo-Icelandic Cod War of 1972–1973|last = Hart|first = Jeffrey A.|publisher = |year = 1976|isbn = |location = |pages = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=264803&amp;lang=en|title = Timarit.is|last = Iceland|first = National and University Library of|website = timarit.is|language = en|access-date = 2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 1973, [[Joseph Luns]], Secretary-General of NATO, arrived in Reykjavík to talk with Icelandic ministers, who had been pressed to leave NATO, as it had been of no help to Iceland in the conflict.&lt;ref name="Bakaki 63–78"/&gt; Britain and Iceland were both NATO members. The Royal Navy made use of bases in Iceland during the Cold War to fulfill its primary NATO duty, guarding the [[GIUK gap|Greenland-Iceland-UK gap]].

After a series of talks within NATO, British warships were recalled on 3 October.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 101"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trawlermen played ''[[Rule, Britannia!|Rule Britannia!]]'' over their radios, as they had done when the Royal Navy entered the waters. They also played ''[[The Party's Over (Willie Nelson song)|The Party's Over]]''.&lt;ref name="Jóhannesson 2006 101"/&gt; An agreement was signed on 8 November to limit British fishing activities to certain areas inside the 50&amp;nbsp;nmi limit. The agreement, resolving the dispute, was approved by the Althing on 13 November 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was based on the premise that British trawlers would limit their annual catch to no more than 130,000 [[ton]]s. The Icelanders were reportedly prepared to settle for 156,000 tons in July 1972 but had increased their demands by spring of 1973 and coffered 117,000 tons (the British demanded 145,000 tons in spring 1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 88, 94, 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement expired in November 1975, and the third "Cod War" began.

The Second Cod War threatened Iceland's membership in NATO and the US military presence in Iceland. It was the closest that Iceland has come to canceling its bilateral Defence Agreement with the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A western cold war: the crisis in Iceland's relations with Britain, the United States, and NATO, 1971–74|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592290312331295694|journal = Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 0959-2296|pages = 94–136|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/09592290312331295694|first = Valur|last = Ingimundarson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelandic NATO membership and hosting of US military had considerable importance to Cold War strategy because of Iceland's location in the middle of the [[GIUK gap]].

After the entry of the Royal Navy into the contested waters, at any given time, four frigates and an assortment of tugboats would generally protect the British trawling fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006| pages = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of this Cod War, a total of 32 British frigates had entered the contested waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year = 2006|pages = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the third [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea#UNCLOS III|United Nations Conference of the Law on the Sea]] in 1975, several countries supported a {{convert|100|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} limit to territorial waters.&lt;ref name=NationalArchives /&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1998 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, 1973–1982|url=http://legal.un.org/diplomaticconferences/lawofthesea-1982/lawofthesea-1982.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 1975, the Icelandic government announced its intention to extend its fishery limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Þorskastríðin þrjú|last = Jóhannesson|first = Guðni Th.|year=2006|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Cod War (November 1975 – June 1976) began after Iceland again extended its fishing limits, now to {{convert|200|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} from its coast. The British government did not recognise the large increase to the exclusion zone and so an issue occurred with British fishermen and their activity in the disputed zone. The conflict, which was the most hard-fought of the Cod Wars, saw British fishing trawlers have their nets cut by the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]], and there were several incidents of [[ramming]] by Icelandic ships and British trawlers, frigates and tugboats.

One of the most serious incidents occurred on 11 December 1975. As reported by Iceland, V/s ''Þór'', under the command of Helgi Hallvarðsson, was leaving port at [[Seyðisfjörður]], where it had been minesweeping, when orders were received to investigate the presence of unidentified foreign vessels at the mouth of the fjord. The vessels were identified as three British ships: ''Lloydsman'', an oceangoing tug three times bigger than V/s ''Þór''; ''Star Aquarius'', an oil rig supply vessel of British [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]; and her sister ship, ''Star Polaris''.

Hutton Press. c 1992. {{ISBN|1-872167-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Icelandic account, when ordered to leave Icelandic territorial waters by the commander of ''Þór'', the three tugboats initially complied. However, around two nautical miles (4&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast, ''Star Aquarius'' allegedly veered to starboard and hit ''Þór''s port side as the Coast Guards attempted to overtake her. Even as ''Þór'' increased speed, ''Lloydsman'' again collided with its port side. ''Þór'' had suffered considerable damage by these hits and so when ''Star Aquarius'' came about, a blank round was fired from ''Þór''. That did not deter ''Star Aquarius'', as it hit ''Þór'' a second time. Another shot was fired from ''Þór'' as a result, this time a live round that hit the bow of ''Star Aquarius''. Then, the tugboats retreated. V/s ''Þór'', which was close to sinking after the confrontation, sailed to [[Loðmundarfjörður]] for temporary repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Atli Magnússon, ''Í kröppum sjó : Helgi Hallvarðsson skipherra segir frá sægörpum og svaðilförum''. Örn og Örlygur. [Reykjavík]. 1992. p. 204-206 {{ISBN|9979-55-035-X}} Ib. :&lt;/ref&gt;

The British reports of the incident differ considerably and maintain that ''Þór'' attempted to board one of the tugboats, and as ''Þór'' broke away, ''Lloydsman'' surged forward to protect ''Star Aquarius''. Captain Albert MacKenzie of ''Star Aquarius'' said that ''Þór'' approached from the stern and hit the support vessel before it veered off and fired a shot from a range of about {{convert|100|yd|m|-1}}. Niels Sigurdsson, the Icelandic Ambassador in London, said that ''Þór'' had been firing in self-defence after it had been rammed by British vessels. Iceland consulted the [[UN Security Council]] over the incident, which declined to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson, ''Þorskastríðin þrjú : saga landhelgismálsins 1948–1976'', Hafréttarstofnun Íslands. Reykjavík. 2006. {{ISBN|9979-70-141-2}} (ib.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate Royal Navy response was to dispatch a large frigate force, which was already well on the way to Icelandic waters, before the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, or the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, were informed.&lt;ref&gt;S.Crosland. Tony Crosland. Cape. London (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy saw the opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of its older [[Type 12 frigate|Type 12]] and [[Tribal-class frigate|Type 81]] frigates for sustained deployment in the area of the [[Denmark Strait]], where they were expected to deter the passage of Soviet submarines while the Royal Navy was threatened by further serious defence and naval cuts by the Royal Navy's chief ''bête noire'', the Chancellor of Exchequer and former Minister of Defence, [[Denis Healey]].&lt;ref&gt;Admiral Sandy Woodward. One Hundred Days. Memoirs of a Falklands Battlegroup Commander. Naval Institute Press. RI&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy saw its strategic aim at the time to be as much as fighting Healey as the Soviet Navy.&lt;ref&gt;S.Woodward.Memoirs of a Falklands Battlegroup Commander.(1992)RI&lt;/ref&gt; The Second and Third Cod Wars were necessary wars for the Royal Navy, like the Falklands Operation, six years later.&lt;ref&gt;Rear Admiral. Chris Parry. Down South. A Falklands War Diary. Penquin (2013). London.&lt;/ref&gt; To Crosland, also MP for the trawler port of Grimsby, the third war was a more serious threat to the Western Alliance than the Middle East was.&lt;ref&gt;K. Threakston. British Foreign Secretaries since 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident occurred in January 1976, when [[HMS Andromeda (F57)|HMS ''Andromeda'']] collided with ''Þór'', which sustained a hole in its hull; the hull of ''Andromeda'' was dented. The British Ministry of Defence said that the collision represented a "deliberate attack" on the British warship 'without regard for life'. The Icelandic Coast Guard, on the other hand insisted, that ''Andromeda'' had rammed ''Þór'' by "overtaking the boat and then swiftly changing course'. After the incident and facing a growing number of ships enduring dockyard repairs, the Royal Navy ordered a 'more cautious approach' in dealing with 'the enemy cutting the trawlers' warps'.&lt;ref&gt;Ships Monthly – Volume 39 – Page 35 – Endlebury Publishing Company, 2004
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 1976, the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced that a fisherman from Grimsby had become the first British casualty of the Third Cod War, when a [[hawser]] hit and seriously injured him after Icelandic vessels cut a trawl.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; While a British parliamentary source reported in a 1993 debate that a British trawlerman was accidentally killed by a solid shot fired by an Icelandic patrol boat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tuesday 30 March 1993|url = http://hansardarchiv.es/select-committees/tuesday-30-march-1993.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021627/http://hansardarchiv.es/select-committees/tuesday-30-march-1993.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-11-17|website = hansardarchiv.es|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggestion has not been corroborated by any historical sources.

Britain deployed a total of 22 frigates and ordered the reactivation from reserve of the [[Leopard-class frigate|Type 41 frigate]] HMS ''Jaguar'' and [[Salisbury-class frigate|Type 61]] HMS ''Lincoln'', refitting them as specialist ramming craft with reinforced wooden bows. In addition to the frigates, the British also deployed a total of seven supply ships, nine tugboats and three support ships to protect its fishing trawlers, but only six to nine of the vessels were on deployment at any one time.&lt;ref name=Janes/&gt; The Royal Navy was prepared to accept serious damage to its Cold War frigate fleet, costing millions and disabling part of its North Atlantic capacity for more than a year. HMS ''Yarmouth'' had its bow torn off, HMS ''Diomede'' had a 40 ft gash ripped through its hull and HMS ''Eastbourne'' suffered such structural damage from ramming by Icelandic gunboats that it had to be reduced to a moored operational training frigate. Iceland deployed four patrol vessels (V/s ''Óðinn'', V/s ''Þór'', V/s ''Týr'', and V/s ''Ægir'') and two armed trawlers (V/s ''Baldur'' and V/s ''Ver'').&lt;ref name="Janes"&gt;''Jane's fighting ships : the standard reference of the world's navies.'' London, [1900–].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atli Magnússon, ''Í kröppum sjó : Helgi Hallvarðsson skipherra segir frá sægörpum og svaðilförum''. Örn og Örlygur. [Reykjavík]. 1992. p. 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; The Icelandic government tried to acquire US [[Asheville class gunboat]]s and when it was denied by [[Henry Kissinger]], it tried to acquire Soviet [[Mirka class frigate]]s instead.

A more serious turn of events came when Iceland threatened closure of the NATO base at [[Keflavík]], which would have severely impaired NATO's ability to deny access to the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet Union. As a result, the British government agreed to have its fishermen stay outside Iceland's {{convert|200|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} exclusion zone without a specific agreement.

On the evening of 6 May 1976, after the outcome of the Third Cod War had already been decided, the [[V/s Týr|V/s ''Týr'']] was trying to cut the nets of the trawler ''Carlisle'' when Captain Gerald Plumer of [[HMS Falmouth (F113)|HMS ''Falmouth'']] ordered it rammed. ''Falmouth'' at the speed of more than 22 knots (41 km/h) rammed ''Týr'', almost capsizing her. ''Týr'' did not sink and managed to cut the nets of ''Carlisle'', and ''Falmouth'' rammed it again. ''Týr'' was heavily damaged and found herself propelled by only a single screw and pursued by the tug-boat ''Statesman''. In the dire situation, Captain [[Guðmundur Kjærnested]] gave orders to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of firepower HMS ''Falmouth'' enjoyed, to deter any further ramming.&lt;ref&gt;Óttar Sveinsson, ''Útkall : Týr er að sökkva''. Útkall. [Reykjavík] 2004. {{ISBN|9979-9569-6-8}} (ib.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Cod War saw 55 ramming incidents altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cod Wars {{!}} Britishseafishing.co.uk|url = http://britishseafishing.co.uk/the-cod-wars/|website = britishseafishing.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In NATO-mediated sessions,&lt;ref name="Bakaki 63–78"/&gt; an agreement was reached between Iceland and the UK on 1 June 1976. The British were allowed to keep 24 trawlers within the 200&amp;nbsp;nmi and fish a total of 30,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Þorskastríðin þrjú| last = Jóhannesson| first = Guðni Th.| year = 2006| pages = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Iceland came closest to withdrawing from NATO and expelling US forces in the Second Cod War, Iceland actually took the most serious action in all of the Cod Wars in the Third Cod War by ending diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 19 February 1976.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt; Although Icelandic government was firmly pro-Western, the government linked Iceland's NATO membership with the outcomes of the fishery dispute. If a favorable outcome could not be reached, Iceland implied that it would withdraw from NATO. However, the government never explicitly linked the US Defence Agreement to the outcome of the dispute.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson2006" /&gt;

== Results==
Iceland achieved its overall aims. As a result, the already-declining British fisheries were hit hard by being excluded from their prime fishing grounds&lt;ref&gt;Georg H.

Oxford University Press, 1992. p. 95. {{ISBN|0-19-211676-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost for repairing the damaged Royal Navy frigates was probably over £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trawling: the rise and fall of the British trawl fishery|last=Robinson|first=Robb|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=1996|isbn=0859894800|location=|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the British government offered a multimillion-pound compensation deal and apology to fishermen who lost their livelihoods in the 1970s. More than 35 years after the workers lost their jobs, the £1,000 compensation offered to 2,500 fisherman was criticised for being insufficient and excessively delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article3376266.ece |title= Cod Wars payment is 'too little, too late' |author= Nick Drainey |date= 6 April 2012 |newspaper= The Times |accessdate= 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==
A 2016 review article finds that the underlying drivers behind the desire to extend fishery limits were economic and legal for Iceland, but they were economic and strategic for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinsson|first=Sverrir|date=2016-03-22|year=|title=The Cod Wars: a re-analysis|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2016.1160376?journalCode=feus20|journal=European Security|volume=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/09662839.2016.1160376|issn=0966-2839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, however, argues that "these underlying causes account for the tensions but are not enough to explain why bargaining failure occurred".&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; After all, the outbreak of each Cod War was costly and risky for both sides.

Several factors are mentioned to explain why bargaining failure occurred.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; The nature of nationalism and party competition for Iceland and pressure from the trawling industry for Britain are reasons that both sides took actions that were of noticeable risk to their broader security interests. Interdepartmental competition and unilateral behaviour by individual diplomats were also factors, with the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries influencing the British government's decision 'more than the Foreign Office'.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;

A 2017 study argues that both a combination of powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and miscalculation by those statesmen contributed to the outbreak of the Cod Wars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study argues that Iceland won each of the Cod Wars because Icelandic statesmen were too greatly constrained by domestic politics to offer compromises to the British, but British statesmen were not as constrained by public opinion at home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Lessons drawn for international relations ==
International relations scholars such as [[Robert Keohane]], [[Joseph Nye]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Richard Ned Lebow|Ned Lebow]] have written on the Cod Wars.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;

The 2016 review article finds that lessons from the Cod Wars have most commonly been applied to [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] [[international relations theory]] and theories on [[Inequality of bargaining power|asymmetric bargaining]].&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; It claims that the Cod Wars are widely seen as inconsistent with the precepts of the [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal peace]], since democracy, trade and institutions are supposed to pacify interstate behavior.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; The Cod Wars are also held up as an example of the decreasing salience of [[hard power]] in international relations, with implications for realist theory which emphasizes the importance of hard power.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt; Theorists on asymmetric bargaining have emphasized how Iceland, lacking structural power, can still have an issue power advantage, with its greater commitment to the cause.&lt;ref name="Steinsson2016" /&gt;

A 2017 study argues that the occurrence of the Cod Wars is inconsistent with liberal international relations theory, including the [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace thesis]], as the "supposedly pacifying factors of the liberal peace – democracy, trade and institutional ties – effectively made the disputes more contentious".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Legacy==
The Cod Wars are often mentioned in Icelandic and British news reporting when either state is involved in a fishery dispute or when there are disputes of some sort between the two countries.

==Biochemistry and effects==

A wide variety of [[alkaloid]] and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of ''ephedra''.  Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ''ephedra'' (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abourashed |first=Ehab A. |author2=Abir T.

Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.

Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a [[performance-enhancing drug]],&lt;ref name="Bents2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bents R, Marsh E |title=Patterns of ephedra and other stimulant use in collegiate hockey athletes |journal=Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=636–43 |year=2006 |pmid=17342884}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bohn A, Khodaee M, Schwenk T |title=Ephedrine and other stimulants as ergogenic aids |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=220–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12834578 |doi=10.1007/s11932-003-0009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calfee R, Fadale P |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=e577–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barker W, Antia U |title=A study of the use of Ephedra in the manufacture of methamphetamine |journal=Forensic Sci Int |volume=166 |issue=2–3 |pages=102–9 |year=2007 |pmid=16707238 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with [[aspirin]] and [[caffeine]]. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9&amp;nbsp;kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boozer C, Daly P, Homel P, Solomon J, Blanchard D, Nasser J, Strauss R, Meredith T |title=Herbal ephedra/caffeine for weight loss: a 6-month randomized safety and efficacy trial |journal=Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |year=2002 |pmid=12032741 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0802023}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several reports have documented a number of [[adverse event]]s attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woolf A, Watson W, Smolinske S, Litovitz T |title=The severity of toxic reactions to ephedra: comparisons to other botanical products and national trends from 1993–2002 |journal=Clin Toxicol |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=347–55 |year=2005 |pmid=16235509 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200066075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adverse effects]] of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, [[headache]], [[insomnia]], profuse perspiration, [[dehydration]], itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and [[hyperthermia]]. More serious potential side effects include [[Heart arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]], [[seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/69213.cfm | title = Ephedra information | publisher= [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] | accessdate = April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purity and dosage==

There are no formal requirements for [[standardization]] or [[quality control]] of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/health/feature/2000/06/07/ephedra/index.html "Swallowing Ephedra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181342/http://archive.salon.com/health/feature/2000/06/07/ephedra/index.html |date=2007-10-12 }}, by Sharon Brownlee.

==Regulation in the United States==
{{see also|Ephedrine#United States}}

Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.

===Initial concerns and industry response===

In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8&amp;nbsp;mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr97064a.html "Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Proposed Rule"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214033309/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr97064a.html |date=2007-02-14 }}, from the [[Federal Register]], June 4, 1997. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[supplement industry]] created a [[public relations]] group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/drugs-supplements/dangerous-supplements-504/overview/index.htm "Dangerous supplements: Still at large"], from ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' magazine. Published May 2004, accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

[[Metabolife]], makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-08-15-ephedra_x.htm Criminal investigation sought for diet supplement seller], published in ''[[USA Today]]'' on August 15, 2002. Accessed April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/news/16554203/detail.html Metabolife Founder Sentenced For Lying To FDA]&lt;/ref&gt; Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] (R. Utah) and [[Tom Harkin]] (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to [[lobbying|lobby]] Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/300234371.html?dids=300234371:300234371&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+5%2C+2003&amp;author=Chuck+Neubauer%2C+Judy+Pasternak+and+Richard+T.+Cooper&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=The+Nation "Senator, His Son Get Boosts From Makers of Ephedra"], published in the [[Los Angeles Times]] on March 5, 2003.

In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas.&lt;ref name="sciencewolfe"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfe S |title=Medicine.

Published in ''[[Business Week]]'' on September 2, 2002. Accessed March 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr00043a.html "Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Withdrawal in Part"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203041741/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr00043a.html |date=2007-02-03 }}, from the [[Federal Register]], April 3, 2000. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional evidence and deaths===

A review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 2000, found a number of cases of [[sudden cardiac death]] or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages.&lt;ref name=Haller_2000 /&gt; Subsequently, in response to pressure from the [[consumer advocacy]] group [[Public Citizen]],&lt;ref name="bw"/&gt; Metabolife was compelled by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from [[insomnia]] to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr2002"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=850679 "The Secret of Ephedra's Questionable Success"]. A report on "All Things Considered", [[National Public Radio]], November 22, 2002. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[offensive lineman]] [[Korey Stringer]] from [[heatstroke]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="stringer"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2003/02/25/stringer_ephedra_ap/ Vikings: Stringer's use of ephedra contributed to death], published online by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on February 25, 2003. Accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Bechler]], a [[pitcher]] for the [[Baltimore Orioles]], died of complications from heatstroke following a [[spring training]] workout on February 17, 2003. The [[medical examiner]] found that ephedra toxicity played a "significant role" in Bechler's sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/orioles/2003-03-13-bechler-exam_x.htm "Medical examiner: Ephedra a factor in Bechler death"], from [[USA Today]], published March 13, 2003. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]], "All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act."&lt;ref name="consumerreports"/&gt;

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that "...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist", and called FDA action to regulate ephedra "long overdue."&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

===Ephedrine supplement ban===

In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] commissioned a large [[meta-analysis]] of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the [[RAND Corporation]]. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] side effects.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shekelle P, Hardy M, Morton S, Maglione M, Mojica W, Suttorp M, Rhodes S, Jungvig L, Gagné J |title=Efficacy and safety of ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance: a meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=12 |pages=1537–45 |year=2003 |pmid=12672771 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.12.1537 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=196247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost simultaneously, a study in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as [[kava]] or ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]''.&lt;ref name=Bent_2003/&gt;

On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a [[press release]] recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/ephedra/december2003/ "FDA Announces Plans to Prohibit Sales of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra"]: Press release from the FDA website, issued December 30, 2003, accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. [[Tommy Thompson]], the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]], stated that "...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately."&lt;ref name="fdaban"/&gt; Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Legal challenges===

Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in [[Park City, Utah]], challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah [[Federal District Court]] ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be [[medical ethics|unethical]]. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0DF113EF936A25757C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=print "Judge's Decision Lifts Ban On Sale of Ephedra in Utah"], from ''[[The New York Times]]'', published April 15, 2005. Accessed 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling was appealed to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers.&lt;ref name="fdaappeal"/&gt; Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States.&lt;ref name="fdamain"/&gt; Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in sports==

Ephedrine is listed as a [[Doping (sport)|banned substance]] by both the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Prohibited_List_2006_EN_FR_SP.pdf |title= World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List, 2006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061213063046/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Prohibited_List_2006_EN_FR_SP.pdf |archivedate= 2006-12-13 |df=  }}.&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.50&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}} Accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Football League]] banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[offensive tackle]] [[Korey Stringer]]; ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death.&lt;ref name="stringer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sauerbrun"&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_4022235%20Todd%20Sauerbrun Sauerbrun fails test: Broncos punter faces suspension for use of ephedra], by Bill Williamson.

'''Georgios (George) Helakis''' ({{Lang-el|Γεώργιος Χελάκης}}) is a [[Greece|Greek]] sports journalist, famous for his passionate live radio broadcasting of international football matches, particularly [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 UEFA European Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2kEQumJEbc A sample of Helakis' work on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; During Euro 2004 opening match he compared the [[Greece national football team|Greek national football team]] to a ''pirate ship'', a name which has become the official nickname of the squad since Greece won the tournament.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Born in the village Seliana in [[Aigeira]] in 1964, Helakis is co-owner and commentator for numerous sports media outlets, including ''SportDay'' (Greece's best selling sports daily) and SportFM (Greece's most popular sports radio station). For a short period in the late 2000s, he had also been chairman of [[Panegialios|Panegialios FC]], the semi-professional club of his home town.

Beyond his media-related activities, Helakis is well known as a left-wing activist. The influence of his political ideas is obvious when commenting on matches, citing examples from history and politics and reminding listeners and readers that football must not be used to express national superiority or nationalistic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_7256004_10/10/2006_75214 ''Kathimerini''], 10 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s he was a member of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], but after the party split in 1991, he joined the [[Synaspismos|Coalition of the Left (Synaspismos)]]. In the party's 2004 national congress he was elected in the Central Committee of the party, and in the [[Greek legislative election, 2007|2007 legislative election]] he was a candidate for the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] in the Athens B constituency. He was also candidate for the mayoralty in [[Kallithea]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_607142_10/10/2006_75215 ''Kathimerini''], 10 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Greek local elections, 2006|2006 local elections]], his platform taking 12 percent of the vote.

The following is a glossary of traditional English-language terms used in the three overarching [[cue sports]] disciplines: ''[[carom billiards|carom (or carambole) billiards]]'' referring to the various {{gli|carom}} games played on a [[billiard table]] without {{gli|pockets}}; ''[[Pool (cue sports)|pool (pocket billiards)]]'', which denotes a host of games played on a table with six pockets; and ''[[snooker]]'', played on a large pocket table, and which has a sport culture unto itself distinct from pool. There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as [[English billiards]].
{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}

==Definitions and language==
The term "{{gli|billiards}}" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.

The labels "[[British English|British]]" and "[[United Kingdom|UK]]" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the [[British Empire]] and/or are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], as opposed to [[US English|US]] (and, often, [[Canadian English|Canadian]]) terminology.  The terms "American" or "US" as applied here refer generally to North American usage.  However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.

The term "blackball" is used in this glossary to refer to both [[Blackball (pool)|blackball and eight-ball pool]] as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand.  Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous ("eight-ball pool" is too easily confused with the related "[[eight-ball]]"), and blackball is globally standardized by an [[International Olympic Committee]]-recognized [[Sports governing body|governing body]], the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American {{gli|bar pool}}, and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets.  (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and [[nine-ball]] draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)

Foreign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. {{gli|massé|{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}}}), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.

{{Term| anchor }}
&lt;dd&gt; To {{gli|frozen|freeze}} a ball to a {{gli|cushion}}; such a ball may be said to be '''anchored''' (British: {{gli|tight}}).  This term is largely obsolete [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]] jargon.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|9}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor nurse }}
&lt;dd&gt; A type of {{gli|nurse|nurse shot}} used in [[carom billiards]] games. With one {{gli|object ball}} being {{gli|anchor|anchored}} ({{gli|frozen}}, British: {{gli|tight}}) to a {{gli|cushion}} and the second object ball just slightly away from the cushion, the {{gli|cue ball}} is gently grazed across the face of both balls, freezing the away ball to the rail and moving the frozen ball away the same distance its partner was previously, in an identical but reversed configuration, in position to be struck again by the cue ball from the opposite side to repeat this pattern, back and forth.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|9}} ''Compare {{gli|cradle cannon}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor space }}
&lt;dd&gt; A {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} square box drawn on [[Billiard table|the table]] in [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]], from the termination of a {{gli|balkline}} with the {{gli|cushion}}, thus defining a restricted space in which only 3 {{gli|point|points}} may be scored before one ball must be driven from the area.

{{Defn|no=2|1=An area defined on a [[billiard table]], in games such as [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[bagatelle]], by a single {{gli|balkline}} (drawn or imaginary) that runs across the table near the {{gli|head}} ({{gli|bottom}}) end; exactly where depends upon table type and size. This balk is where the cue ball is placed in {{gli|lag|lagging}} for lead, for making the opening {{gli|break}} shot, and sometimes for other purposes, depending upon the game.  This usage of "balk" is strictly technical, and rarely used in practice. In pool, this area is called the {{gli|kitchen}} and is divided from the rest of the table by the {{gli|head string}}, while in snooker, English billiards and [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] it is the somewhat differently sized and delimited {{gli|baulk}}, defined by the {{gli|baulk line}}.

{{Term|term= ball return |content=ball return {{anchor|ball-return|ball return mechanism|ball-return mechanism}}}}
&lt;dd&gt;A collection bin mounted below the foot end of a table, to which balls potted in any pocket will return by means of gravity-assisted gutters or troughs running from each pocket opening to the bin; these are the '''ball-return mechanism''', which may be internal to the table or an external gutter system. Ball returns have been in use since at least the 1700s. Pockets which simply collect balls are known as {{gli|drop pockets}}.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; A table without a ball return may be called a "drop pocket table", while a table featuring a ball return may be called a "gully table".&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|37, 39}} Coin-operated {{gli|bar table|bar tables}} have ball-return mechanisms that separate the {{gli|cue ball}} from the {{gli|object ball|object balls}} so that the object balls are captured when pocketed until the game ends, then released when paid for again, while the cue ball is continually returned for continued play after {{gli|scratch|scratches}}. This type of table can use a variety of methods to distinguish the cue ball from object balls including the {{gli|Magnetic cue ball}}, the dense ceramic "{{gli|rock}}" and the oversized "{{gli|grapefruit}}" ball. Ball return mechanisms have also been devised that use a smaller, lighter cue ball, instead of a magnetic or heavier one. There are tables that use optical sensors to distinguish a standard cue ball from object balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diamondbilliards.com/CommercialTables/SmartTable.aspx |title=The Smart Table Coin-op |publisher=Diamond Billiard Products |work=DiamondBilliards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bank-the-8 |content=bank-the-8 {{anchor|bank the 8|bank-the-eight|bank the eight}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; A rule variant common in {{gli|bar pool}} versions of [[eight-ball]], in which the 8-ball must be pocketed on a {{gli|bank shot}} (generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a {{gli|kick shot}}); shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game. Players may agree before the game begins to invoke this rule, or one player may challenge another player (who might accept or refuse) to conclude the game in this manner after it is already under way. Playing bank-the-8 can be considered rude if many other players are waiting to use the table, since it often makes the game last considerably longer. Often on bar tables three scratches determines a loss. The same with last-pocket.&lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar player |content=bar player {{anchor|bar players|bar league|bar league player}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''bar league player'''.''
A player that predominantly plays in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]/[[Public house|pubs]], or is in a bar-based pool league. Often used pejoratively by [[pool hall]] players to refer to a perceived lesser skill level of such players. ''See also {{gli|bar pool}}, {{gli|bar table}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar pool |content=bar pool {{anchor|bar rules|pub pool|pub rules|tavern pool}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''bar rules''', '''pub pool''', '''tavern pool'''.}}
[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], almost always a variant of [[eight-ball]], that is played by {{gli|bar player|bar players}} on a {{gli|bar table}}. Bar pool has rules that vary from region to region, sometimes even from venue to venue in the same city, especially in the U.S. Wise players thus ensure understanding of and agreement to the rules before engaging in a {{gli|money game}} under bar rules. Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of {{gli|ball-in-hand}} after a {{gli|foul}}, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be {{gli|call shot|called}} (including {{gli|cushion|cushions}} and other {{gli|object ball|object balls}} to be contacted) not just the {{gli|target ball}} and {{gli|pocket}}. Bar pool has evolved into this "nitpicky" version principally to make the games last longer, since bar pool is typically played on coin-operated tables that cost money per-game rather than per-hour. Competitive league pool played on bar tables, however, usually uses international, national or local/regional league rules, and is not what is usually meant by "bar pool". ''Not to be confused with the game of [[bar billiards]].'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar table |content=bar table {{anchor|pub table|tavern table|coin-operated table|coin operated table|coin-op table|coinop table|bar box|barbox}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''bar box''', '''pub table''', '''tavern table''', '''coin-operated table''', '''coin-op table'''.}}
A distinctive size of pool table found in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]/[[Public house|pubs]]/[[tavern]]s as well as various other venues such as [[family entertainment center]]s and [[Video arcade|arcade rooms]] at [[bowling alley]]s. These are smaller than the full-size tables found in [[pool halls]]. While typical professional and competition tables are {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, bar boxes are typically {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. However, 4×8 and even 3×6 examples can sometimes be found. In bars they are almost always coin-operated. Most North American brands of bar tables have pocket proportions opposite those of regular tables in that the side pockets are remarkably tight while the corners are more generous and are therefore considered irregular. Another factor is the cue ball; these tables capture {{gli|object balls}} to minimize replays, but selectively return the cue ball by identifying it mechanically to allow complete games. To do this they employ one of two mechanisms to return a {{gli|scratch|scratched}} cue ball; these are oversized or extra-dense. Because these cue balls do not play as competition cue balls (especially with regard to {{gli|cut shot|cut}} (due to their larger size) and {{gli|stop shot|stop}}/{{gli|draw shot|draw}} shots (due to their larger mass) respectively, they change the characteristics of the cue ball and are therefore deprecated by aficionados. {{gli|smash-through}}). However, modern bar tables make use of a magnetic core with a regulation or near-regulation size and weight paired with a magnet mechanism within the table's {{gli|ball return}} system that separates out the cue ball without requiring cue ball characteristics that affect play.&lt;ref name="RGivens"&gt;{{cite book

''Not to be confused with the carom billiards concept of a {{gli|big ball}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| big ball }}
&lt;dd&gt; A [[carom billiards]] metaphor, it refers to an object ball positioned and being approached in such a manner that a near miss will rebound off a cushion and still score. It is ''as if'' the ball were larger than normal, making it easier to contact. Normally a ball a couple inches from a rail is a big ball, but only if being approached from an angle and if all the prerequisite rails have already been contacted. A ball near a corner can effectively be a foot wide.
Not to be confused with the eight-ball term "the big balls". In older British usage the concept was referred to as "large ball".&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; ''See also "{{gli|big pocket}}".'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| big pocket }}
&lt;dd&gt; A [[pocket billiards]] and occasionally [[snooker]] term (inherited from carom billiards by way of "{{gli|big ball}}", above), it is a metaphor for a shot that is very difficult to miss pocketing for any of a number of reasons, most commonly either because the object ball is positioned such that a near miss on one side of it will likely cause the cue ball to rebound into the object ball off the rail and pocket it anyway, or another ball is positioned such that if the target ball does not go straight in, it is still likely to go in off the other ball in a {{gli|kiss}}. It is ''as if'' the pocket, for this one shot, had become larger. The term can also refer to the angle of shot toward a pocket, especially a side pocket; the pocket is said to be "bigger", for example, on a shot that is only a 5-degree angle away from straight on, than on a 45-degree angle shot which is much more likely to hit one of the cushion points and bounce away. &lt;/dd&gt;

In [[European Pocket Billiard Federation]] (EPBF) [[nine-ball]], the break box is a zone in the "{{gli|kitchen}}" of the {{gli|head}} (British: {{gli|bottom}}) of the [[Billiard table|table]], from which the {{gli|break|break shot}} must be taken with the {{gli|cue ball}},&lt;ref name="Jewett BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Bob|last=Jewett|date=February 2008|title=Killing Me Softly?: The Outbreak of the Soft Break Threatens the Game of 9-ball|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panozzo BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Mike|last=Panozzo|date=February 2008|title=Long Live the Cup!|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; not unlike {{gli|"D", the|the "D"}} zone used in [[snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]]. The break box consists of the middle 50% of the kitchen area, delimited latitudinally by the {{gli|head rail}} (British: {{gli|bottom rail}}) and {{gli|head string}} (not the {{gli|baulk line}}), and longitudinally by two parallel lines drawn (on the cloth, or more often imaginarily) from the head rail {{gli|diamond|diamonds}} that are closest to the {{gli|head}} {{gli|corner pocket|corner pockets}}, out to the head string ''(see illustration to the right)'' on either side. This departure from [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]] World Standardised Rules defeats the common break-from-the-side-rail technique for pocketing the 9 ball to win the game on the break; while 9 ball breaks are still possible, they are much more difficult under this rule.&lt;ref name="Jewett BD 2008-02"/&gt; This EPBF Euro-Tour requirement was added in 2008 to the Europe vs. US [[all-star]] team event, the [[Mosconi Cup]], but has not otherwise been seen much by non-Europeans {{as of|lc=y|2011|post=.}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| calcutta }}
&lt;dd&gt; A player's auction at a pool tournament. Each player is called and players and spectators bid on the player. The highest bidder(s) pays their bid to the calcutta, and by doing so invest in that player's success. If a player wins or places in the tournament, those who "bought" the player receive a percentage of the total calcutta payout, usually tracking the percentage payout of the tournament prize fund. Typically, players have the option of purchasing half of themselves when the high bid is won by a third party.

{{Term| call }}
&lt;dd&gt; Any instance of a player having to say what they are about to do. For example, in [[straight pool]] a player must ''call'' the pocket in which a ball is intended to be potted.

&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''called-safe'''}}
Applies specifically to games that enforce "{{cuegloss|call-pocket}}/call-safe" rules, which require the player to either call the ball and pocket, or call a {{cuegloss|safety}} on every shot.  After a legal shot, where a called ball is not pocketed as designated, the incoming player has the option to pass the shot back to the player who missed the called shot.  If a player calls "safe", then after a legal shot, the incoming player must accept the next shot, and may not pass the shot back to the player who called "safe".&lt;ref name="ABC rulebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rulebook: Guidelines for American Rotation (AR)|url= http://AmericanBilliardClub.com/play/rulebook/ |work=AmericanBilliardClub.com  |publisher=American Billiard Club |first=Joe |last=Tucker|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call-shot/call-safe [[nine-ball]] example: Player A calls the {{cuegloss|ball-on}}, the 3 ball in this case, in the corner pocket but misses the shot.

{{Term|term= cheat the pocket |content=cheat the pocket {{anchor|cheat-the-pocket|cheating the pocket|cheating-the-pocket}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; To aim at an object ball such that it will enter one side or the other, rather than the center, of a pocket. This permits the cue ball to strike the object ball at a different contact point than the most obvious one. Cheating the pocket is employed for {{gli|position play}}, to allow a ball to pass another partially obscuring the path to the pocket, and to prevent {{gli|scratch|scratches}} on dead-straight shots in cases where draw is not desirable (or may not be dependable, e.g. because of distance from the pocket or {{gli|smash-through}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capelle|first=Philip B.|title=Play Your Best Pool|publisher=Billiards Press|year=1995|page=17|isbn=978-0-9649204-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| check side }}
&lt;dd&gt; also commonly referred to as "check" is a type of {{gli|english|spin}} imparted to the {{gli|cue ball}} to make it rebound from a {{gli|cushion}} at a shallower angle than it would if the spin had not been used.

&lt;dd&gt; Known as a '''{{gli|rocking cannon}}''' in British terminology.
A type of {{gli|nurse}} used in [[carom billiards]] games. With one object ball {{gli|frozen}} (British: {{gli|tight}}) to a {{gli|cushion}} and the second object ball a few inches away from the cushion, the cue ball is gently rebounded off the frozen ball not moving it, but with just enough speed to meet the other object ball which rocks in place, but does not change position.

{{Term| cinch a pocket }}
&lt;dd&gt; To maneuver a ball on a shot so that it will be favorably positioned for later play into a particular pocket, even at the expense of sacrificing position or the inning to achieve that result.&lt;ref name="Brandt"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| cinch position }}
&lt;dd&gt; To play a shot using a more difficult application of stroke and speed to achieve a certain desired position for the next shot, even at the expense of or sharply increasing the likelihood of a miss.&lt;ref name="Brandt"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| clearance }}
&lt;dd&gt; In [[snooker]] and British [[Pocket billiards|pool]], the successful {{gli|pot|potting}} of all object {{gli|ball-on|balls-on}} in a single {{gli|frame}}. A player is said to have "cleared up" or to have "cleared the table". Also, if a snooker player compiles a {{gli|break}} consisting of all 15 {{gli|red ball|reds}} with {{gli|colour ball|colours}}, then the colours in sequence, this is known as a "total clearance".  ''Compare {{gli|break and run}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| cling }}
&lt;dd&gt; Phenomenon where two balls, (usually the {{gli|cue ball}} and an {{gli|object ball}}) have some foreign material (often residual {{gli|chalk}} or dirt picked up from unbrushed cloth) between them at the point of contact, resulting in the struck object ball being thrown offline from the expected trajectory, and often also affecting the post-impact path of the cue ball. A typical precaution against cling is to ask for the cue ball and/or object ball to be cleaned by the referee in order to remove chalk that is already on the ball prior to the shot. The table cloth should also be clean. However, no precaution can ward against cling resulting from chalk transferred from the cue tip to the cue ball during a single shot. Coincidental cling can therefore cause unpredictable play and occasionally lead to rudimentary shots being missed at even the highest levels of the game.&lt;ref name="BBC4304501"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/video_and_audio/help_guide/4304501.stm BBC Sport video] investigating the cause of {{gli|cling}} (a.k.a. {{gli|kick|kicks}} or {{gli|skid}}); retrieved 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  "Cling" (and derived words like "clung", "clinger", "clinging", etc.) may be used as a mass noun, less commonly as a count noun, as a verb, and rarely as an adjective ("cling is annoying", "two clings in one frame", "they clung", "unintentional cling shot", respectively).

{{Term| cloth }}
&lt;dd&gt; The [[baize]] cloth covering the tables playing surface and rails, usually made from wool or a wool-nylon blend. In use since the 15th century, cloth is traditionally green-colored, chosen for its evocation of grass. Sometimes cloth is improperly referred to as "felt." The properties of the cloth used to cover a table, as well as environmental conditions that can affect it—notably humidity, the degree it has been stretched when installed, and its level of cleanness—have a profound effect on play.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|53}} ''See also {{gli|fast}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''combination shot''', '''combo'''.''
Any shot in which the cue ball contacts an object ball, which in turn hits one or more additional object balls (which in turn may hit yet further object balls) to send the last-hit object ball to an intended place, usually a pocket.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; In the UK this is often referred to as a {{gli|plant}}. &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| cradle cannon }}
&lt;dd&gt; A type of {{gli|nurse}} shot used in [[English billiards]] in which two coloured balls are positioned on either side of the mouth of a snooker table pocket but not touching and, thus placed, can be  successively contacted and scored off over and over by the cue ball without moving them. The cradle cannon's first known use was by Walter Lovejoy in 1907. The unofficial record using the shot is held by [[Tom Reece]] who in 1907, over the course of a month, scored 499,135 points using the cradle cannon before stopping without missing.

{{Term| eight-ball |content=eight-ball {{anchor|eight-ball|eightball|eight ball}}}}
{{Defn|1= One of several games ultimately derived from a game called B.B.C. Company pool, promulgated by the [[Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company]] from around 1900 to the 1920s. They have in common the use of a {{gli|rack}} of fifteen {{gli|object ball|object balls}} and a single {{gli|cue ball}}, a hard {{gli|break}} from behind the {{gli|head string}} or {{gli|baulk line}}, and a goal of {{gli|pocket|pocketing}} ({{gli|pot|potting}}) all of one's own {{gli|suit}} of balls then finally the black 8 ball.  There are three general types of this game:
* [[eight-ball]], an originally American and now internationally standardized professional version, also subject to competitive team play in numerous leagues. It is the most-played form of competition pool in the world, though not for professionals, among whom [[nine-ball]] dominates.  Uses a set of {{gli|stripes|striped}} and {{gli|solids|solid}} numbered balls. Ball-and-pocket are {{gli|call pocket|called}} for each shot, with {{gli|foul|fouls}} ({{gli|fault|faults}}) resulting in {{gli|ball-in-hand|cue ball in-hand}} for the opponent, anywhere on the table.
* [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] a.k.a. eightball pool, an originally British variant, also favoured in many Commonwealth countries, and parts of Continental Europe, with amateur and professional leagues.  The two names reflect slightly variant rulesets, which differ primarily in handling of {{gli|fault|faults}} ({{gli|foul|fouls}}). Shots are not {{gli|call shot|called}}. Uses a set of {{gli|yellows|yellow}} and {{gli|reds|red}} balls. {{gli|Pub pool}} usually consists of minor local variations on one of these two standardised rule sets.
* "straight eight" a.k.a. {{gli|bar pool}}, a widely divergent set of variations on standard eight-ball, and also using the stripes-and-solids ball set.  Usually requires a very strict version of {{gli|called-shot}} play, in which every aspect of a shot must be pre-specified, including {{gli|kiss|kisses}}, {{gli|carom|caroms}}, {{gli|kick|kicks}}, and {{gli|bank|banks}}, with loss of turn resulting from any deviation. Outright {{gli|foul|fouls}} ({{gli|fault|faults}}) result in {{gli|ball-in-hand|cue ball in-hand}} for the opponent, behind the {{gli|head string}} only. Rules may vary from venue to venue even within the same city.  These variants arose primarily to drag out the game on coin-operated tables ("{{gli|bar box|bar boxes}}").  In North America, many casual recreational players are unaware any other form of pool exists beyond bar pool.

{{Defn|1= In snooker, a situation during a {{gli|frame}} in which the first line of the remaining {{gli|red ball|reds}} grouped together, where the original {{gli|pack}} was, are in a straight horizontal line.

{{Term| fluke }}
{{Defn|1= A shot that has an ostensibly positive outcome for the player, although it was not what the player intended. Examples of flukes include an unexpected {{gli|pot}} off several {{gli|cushion|cushions}} or other balls having missed the pocket aimed for, or a lucky {{gli|safety}} position after having missed a shot.  Many players are apologetic after a fluke, and in most games such an accident is a loss of turn. Some rule sets (most notably those of [[nine-ball]] and related games generally, and the [[eight-ball]] rules of the [[American Poolplayers Association]] and its affiliates) count flukes as valid, point-making shots.

{{Term| follow }}
{{Defn|1= The forward rotation of the {{gli|cue ball}} that results from a {{gli|follow shot}}. Also known as '''{{gli|top spin}}''' or '''top''', follow is applied to the {{gli|cue ball}} by hitting it above its {{gli|equator}}, causing it to spin more rapidly in the direction of travel than it would simply by rolling on the cloth from a center-ball hit. Follow speeds the cue ball up, and widens both the {{gli|carom|carom angle}} after contact with an {{gli|object ball}}, and {{gli|angle of reflection}} off a {{gli|cushion}}.  ''See illustration at {{gli|spin}}.'' }}

{{Term| follow shot }}
{{Defn|1= A shot in which the {{gli|cue ball}} is struck above its equator with sufficient {{gli|top spin}} to cause the cue ball to travel forward after it contacts an {{gli|object ball}}. When a cue ball with follow on it contacts an object ball squarely (a center-to-center hit), the cue ball travels directly forward through the space previously occupied by the object ball (and can sometimes even be used to pocket a second ball). By contrast, on a cut shot, a cue ball with follow on it will first travel on the {{gli|tangent line}} after striking the object ball, and then arc forward, widening the {{gli|carom}} angle.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;  ''See illustration at {{gli|spin}}.'' }}

{{Term| foot spot }}
{{Defn|1= The point on the table surface over which the apex ball of a rack is centered (in most games). It is the point half the distance between the {{gli|long rail|long rails}}' second diamonds from the end of the racking end of the table. The foot spot is the intersection of the {{gli|foot string}} and the {{gli|long string}}, and is typically marked with a cloth or paper decal on pool tables.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;   ''Contrast {{gli|head spot}}.'' }}

{{Term| foot string }}
{{Defn|1= An imaginary line running horizontally across a billiards table from the second diamond (from the foot end of the table) on one long rail to the corresponding second diamond on the other long rail.

{{Term| forward spin }}
{{Defn|1= ''Same as {{gli|follow}} ({{gli|top spin}}).'' }}

{{Term| foul }}
{{Defn|1=
{{ghat|Sometimes interchangeable with {{gli|scratch}}, though the latter is often used only to refer to the foul of pocketing the cue ball.}}
A violation of a particular game's rules for which a set penalty is imposed. In many pool games the penalty for a foul is ball-in-hand anywhere on the table for the opponent. In some games such as straight pool, a foul results in a loss of one or more points. In one-pocket, in which a set number of balls must be made in a specific pocket, upon a foul the player must return a ball to the table. In some games, three successive fouls in a row is a loss of game. In straight pool, a third successive foul results in a loss of 16 points (15 plus one for the foul).&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;

{{Term|term= free ball |content=free ball {{anchor|free balls|free shot|free shots|free-ball|freeball|free-shot|freeshot}}}}
{{Defn|1= ''Also '''free shot'''.''
[[File:Snooker Freeball.png|thumb|right|200px|Freeball situation. Red is snookered, Blue can be called.]]
A situation where a player has {{gli|foul|fouled}}, leaving the opponent {{gli|snooker|snookered}}. In [[Eight-ball#UK|UK eight-ball]] this would normally give the opponent the option of one of two plays: (1) {{gli|ball-in-hand}} with {{gli|two shots}}; (2) being allowed to contact, or even {{gli|pot}}, a ball other than one from his/her set from the snookered position (although the black may not be potted), with the loss of the first shot.  In addition, some variations of the game allow the player to pot one of the opposition's balls, on the first visit only, without the loss of a "free shot".

In [[snooker]] it allows a player to call any ball as the ball she/he would have wanted to play, potting it for the same number of points, or the opponent can be put back in without the same privilege, having to play the ball snookered on. The definition of ''snooker'' on this occasion means the opponent cannot strike both extreme edges of the {{gli|object ball}} (or a cluster of touching balls).&lt;!-- Not sure this agrees with what is said at [[#two shots]] and [[#two-shot carry]]. --&gt; }}

{{Term| frozen }}
{{Defn|1= ''Chiefly American:'' A resting ball that is in actual contact with a {{gli|cushion}} or with one or more other balls is said to be "frozen" (or, colloquially, "froze") to that cushion or the touching ball(s).&lt;ref name="Knuchell"/&gt;{{rp|239}}&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;  ''(For '''frozen combination/combo''', '''frozen kiss''', etc., that is almost impossible to miss, see the more common variants under {{gli|dead}}).''  The chiefly British "{{gli|tight}}" is equivalent to "frozen", but only applied to frozen/tight to a cushion, not to another ball.  For situations in which the {{gli|cue ball}} is frozen to an {{gli|object ball}}, different rule sets have different approaches. In some, the cue ball must be addressed with the [[Cue stick|cue]] at an angle at least 45 degrees divergent from an imaginary line running through the center of the balls, to minimize chances of a {{gli|push shot}}. In [[snooker]] (and some British [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] rules), this is called a {{gli|touching ball}}, and the cue ball must be shot away from the object ball without the latter moving.}}

{{Term|term= full |content=full {{anchor|full-ball|full ball|fullball|fuller|fullest}}}}
{{Defn|1= ''Also '''full-ball'''.''
A type of {{gli|contact}} between two balls from which no or little angle is created between their paths; the contact required to {{gli|pot}} a straight shot.

{{Term| kitchen }}
{{Defn|1= The area on the table behind the {{gli|head string}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; The origin of the term has been the subject of some speculation but the best explanation known is that in the 1800s, many homes did not have room for both a billiard table and a dining room table. The solution was a billiards table that had a cover converting it into a dining table. Kept in the dining room, play on such a table was often restricted by the size of the room, so it would be placed so that the head rail would face the connected kitchen door, thus affording a player room for the backswing without hitting a wall. A player was therefore either half or sometimes fully (literally) "in the kitchen" when breaking the balls.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; ''See also {{gli|baulk}}.'' }}

{{Term|term= knuckle |content=knuckle {{anchor|knuckles}}}}
{{Defn|1= One of two jutting curves of the {{gli|nose|noses}} of the {{gli|cushion|cushions}} on either side of each {{gli|pocket}} where cushion and pocket meet, forming the {{gli|jaw}} of the pocket. The knuckles are protrusive and comparatively sharp on a [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] table, and can be used like a [[Backboard (basketball)|basketball backboard]] to rebound a ball into a pocket.  On [[billiard table]]s for [[snooker]], [[English billiards]], [[Russian pyramid]] and various other games, the knuckles are rounded, and thwart the backboard effect.  The curvature of snooker and English billiards knuckles are determined by {{gli|pocket template|pocket templates}} produced by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]].&lt;ref name="WPBSA 2011"/&gt;{{rp|9}} The knuckle is also known as a {{gli|point}}, {{gli|horn}} or {{gli|titty}}, depending on area and company. }}

{{Term|term=lag |content=lag {{anchor|the lag|lagging|lag for the break|lagging for the break}} }}
{{Defn|1= Also '''the lag''' (as a noun) '''lagging''', '''lag for the break''' and '''lagging for the break'''. 
To determine the order of play, players (representing only themselves, or sometimes teams) each near simultaneously shoot a ball from the {{gli|kitchen}} (or in British games, from the {{gli|baulk line}}) to the {{gli|end rail}} and back toward the {{gli|bottom rail}}. Whichever shooter's ball comes to rest closest to the bottom rail gets to choose who {{gli|break|breaks}}.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{Rp|139}} It is permissible but not required for the lagged ball to touch or rebound from the bottom rail, but not to touch the side rails. Lagging is usually a two-party activity, though there are games such as [[cutthroat (pool)|cutthroat]] in which three players might lag. In the case of a tie, the tying shooters re-lag. The lag is most often used in tournament play or other competitions.
In hard-break games like [[nine-ball]] and [[eight-ball]] the winner of the lag would normally take the break, while in soft-break games like [[straight pool]] would likely require the loser of the lag to break, since breaking would be a disadvantage.  ''See also {{gli|string-off}}.'' }}

{{Term|term= last-pocket |content=last-pocket {{anchor|last pocket|lastpocket}}}}
{{Defn|1= ''Also '''last pocket'''.''
A common rule in informal {{gli|bar pool}}, especially bar/pub [[eight-ball]], in which the {{gli|money ball}} must be {{gli|pocket|pocketed}} ({{gli|pot|potted}}) in the same pocket as the shooter's last {{gli|object ball}} (each player may be said to eventually "own" a pocket, for the duration of the game, in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their {{gli|suit}}).  The variant is not extremely common in the United States or the UK, but is near-universal in much of Latin America (where two {{gli|cue ball}} {{gli|scratch|scratches}} are permitted when attempting the 8 ball shot and count as simple fouls, with only a third scratch constituting a loss of game).  Last pocket is also common in North Africa. Last-pocket rules require careful {{gli|position play}}, and frequently result in {{gli|bank shot|bank}} and {{gli|kick|kick shots}} with the 8 ball. }}

{{Term| league }}
{{Defn|1= An organization that promotes competitive, usually team, amateur cue sports, most commonly [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], especially [[eight-ball]] and [[nine-ball]], although there are also well-established [[snooker league]]s.  Some leagues, many of which are decades old, are entirely local and either informal or [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], and may use their own local rules or may have adopted more widely published rulesets, such as those of the [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]].  Other leagues are organized on a multi-regional or even international level, and may be non-profit or for-profit enterprises, usually with their own fine-tuned rule books. Despite differences, the largest leagues are increasingly converging toward the WPA rules, with the exception of the [[American Poolplayers Association|APA/CPA]], which retains rules much closer to [[United States|US]]-style {{gli|bar pool}}.  At least four major pool leagues hold international championships in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] annually (APA/CPA, [[Billiard Congress of America|BCAPL]], [[Valley National 8-Ball League Association|VNEA]] and [[American CueSports Alliance|ACS/CCS]]). Some leagues also offer {{gli|one-on-one}} tournaments, {{gli|scotch doubles}} events, [[artistic pool]] competition, and other non-team activities.

{{Term| legal }}
{{Defn|1= As in many other sports, "legal" means not causing or likely to cause a {{gli|foul}} (the opposite being {{gli|illegal}}). A legal ''hit'' is one in which the requirements for a non-foul hit are met (e.g., in [[nine-ball]], the lowest-numbered ball on the table was hit by the {{gli|cue ball}} first, and at least one {{gli|object ball}} was {{gli|pocket|pocketed}}, or any ball reached a {{gli|cushion}}, after the hit on the first object ball.).  A legal ''shot'' is one in which no foul of any kind was involved (e.g. there was not a {{gli|double hit}} by the cue, the player's {{gli|bridge}} hand did not move a ball, etc.).  A legal ''stroke'' is one in which the [[Cue stick|cue]] {{gli|stroke}} obeyed the rules (e.g. the shooter did not perform an illegal {{gli|jump shot}} by scooping under the cue ball with the cue {{gli|cue tip|tip}}).  A legal ''ball'' is a {{gli|ball-on}}, an object ball at which it is permissible for the player to shoot.  And so on.  The term can be used in many ways consistent with these examples ("legal pocket" in [[one-pocket]], "legal equipment" under tournament specifications, etc.). }}

{{Term| left }}

{{Term| long bank }}
{{Defn|1= A {{gli|cross-corner}} bank shot from one end of the table to the other (i.e. across the {{gli|center string}}). Long banks are considerably more difficult, because of the smaller margin for error due to distance and angle widening, than {{gli|cross-side}} banks and short cross-corner banks from the same end of the table. }}

{{Term| magnetic cue ball }}
{{Defn|1= A {{gli|cue ball}} that, due to embedded iron content, is responsive enough to a strong [[magnet]] that a modern coin-operated {{gli|bar table}} with a magnetic {{gli|ball return|ball-return mechanism}} can distinguish and separate the cue ball from the {{gli|object ball|object balls}}.  Magnetic cue balls are usually the same standard size as the object balls in the set, and near regulation weight, typically 0.5 to 1 ounce (14–28&amp;nbsp;g) heavier than the object balls.

Magnetic balls are standard equipment in some leagues, including the [[Valley National Eight-ball Association|VNEA]]. Magnetics come in three construction types of iron embedded in the same [[phenolic resin]] or other modern, resilient plastic that the {{gli|object ball|object balls}} are made of: a solid metal core (prone to being off-center and not rolling true); small metal bars distributed around the interior of the ball (the most common, and less prone but not immune to balance defects); and tiny metal filings throughout the material (the most consistent, only made by one manufacturer, and expensive). }}

{{Defn|1= {{ghat|Also '''nurse shot''', '''nursery shot''', '''nursery cannon'''.}}
In carom games such as [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail]], [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline]] and [[cushion caroms]], where all the balls are kept near each other and a cushion, and with very soft shots, can be "nursed" down a rail on multiple successful shots that effectively replicate the same ball setup so that the nurse shot can be repeated again (and again, etc.).

Excessive use of nurse shots by players skilled enough to set them up and pull them off repeatedly at will is what led to the development of the [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline]] [[carom billiards]] game variations, and repetitive shot limitation rules in [[English billiards]].  A clear example of why: In 1907, [[Tom Reece]] scored a record {{gli|break}} of 499,135 consecutive {{gli|point|points}} over a period of five weeks, without a miss, using the {{gli|cradle cannon}} nurse shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Richard Holt | title = Sport And the British: A Modern History | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-19-285229-9 | page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Defn|1= {{ghat|Also '''pro side of the pocket'''; sometimes "of the pocket" is left off the phrase.}}
The {{gli|long rail|long-rail}} side of a {{gli|corner pocket}}.  To "aim for the profession side of the pocket" is to slightly {{gli|overcut}} a difficult corner-pocket {{cuegloss|cut shot}}, to {{cuegloss|cheat the pocket}}, rather than {{gli|undercut|undercutting}}, especially in [[nine-ball]]. Erring too much in this direction is "missing on the professional side of the pocket."  It is so called because experienced players understand that on a thin cut, overcutting the object ball to a corner pocket will far more often leave the object ball in an unfavorable position, i.e. along the {{gli|short rail}} for the incoming opponent than will an undercut, which often leaves the object ball sitting in front of or nearby the pocket it had been intended for on a miss.&lt;ref&gt;[[ESPN]] broadcast of 2007 WPBA Great Lakes Classic, second semi-final.

By contrast, in [[eight-ball]], except when both players are shooting at the {{cuegloss|8 ball}}, the incoming player after a miss is shooting for different object balls, so this maxim does not apply, and the opposite may be good strategy as, if the object ball stays near the pocket through an undercut, it is advantageously positioned for a subsequent turn and may block the opponent's use of the pocket.&lt;ref name="RGivens"/&gt;}}

{{Term| push out }}
{{Defn|1= ''As an adjective or compound noun: '''push-out'''.''
A rule in many games (most notably [[nine-ball]], after and only after the break shot), allowing a player to "push out" the cue ball to a new position without having to contact any ball, much less pocket one or drive it to a {{gli|cushion}}, but not counting any pocketed ball as valid (other foul rules apply, such as {{gli|double hit|double hits}}, {{gli|scratch|scratching}} the cue ball, etc.), with the caveat that the opponent may shoot from the new cue ball position or give the shot back to the pusher who must shoot from the new position.  In nine-ball particularly, and derived games such as [[seven-ball]] and [[ten-ball]], pocketing the {{gli|money ball}} on a push-out results in that ball being {{gli|spot (verb)|respotted}} (which can be used to strategic advantage in certain circumstances, such as when the break leaves no shot on the {{gli|ball-on}}, and failure to hit it would give the incoming player an instant-win {{gli|combination|combination shot}} on the money ball).{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}&lt;!--If in nine-ball I pocket the 5 ball on a push-out, does it also get respotted, in Intl.

Sandbagging is a form of {{gli|hustle|hustling}}, and in {{gli|handicapping|handicapped}} leagues, considered a form of cheating, as it is used to obtain a low handicap so that a skilled player can later use this rating to improper advantage in more important competitions.

{{Term| three-foul rule }}
{{Defn|1= The three-foul rule describes a situation in which a player is assessed a defined penalty after committing a third successive foul. The exact penalty, its prerequisites and whether it is in place at all, vary depending on the games. In [[nine-ball]] and [[straight pool]], a player must be the told he is on two fouls in order to transgress the rule, and if violated, results in a loss of game for the former and a special point penalty of a loss of fifteen points (plus one for the foul itself) in the latter together with the ability to require the violator to rerack and rebreak. In [[Irish standard pool]] and [[English billiards]], it is a loss of game if a player commits a third foul while shooting at {{gli|black ball|the black}}. In [[snooker]], three successive fouls from a non-{{gli|snooker|snookered}} position result in forfeiting the frame. Repeat fouls from a snookered position are quite common – [[Dave Harold]] holds the record in a competitive match, missing the same shot 14 successive times. }}

{{Term| top-of-the-table play}}
{{Defn|1= This technique involves all three balls being grouped in close proximity at the top end of the table and scoring with a succession of short range pots and cannons.  A typical starting point is with the red placed on its spot, object white on or near the centreline somewhere between the spot and the top cushion, and the cueball posed nearby to pot the red or make a gentle cannon.  If the pot, then it should be played so as to leave the cueball in a good position for the next shot.  If the cannon, then the purpose is to disturb the object white as little as possible and finish clear to pot the red which has been left near the corner pocket.  Then in potting the red the cueball must again be left in a good position for the next shot, and so on.  This form of play makes it possible to compile really big breaks in relatively short time. }}

{{Defn|1= [[File:Snooker Touching Ball Red.png|thumb|right|Touching ball with red ball]]
In [[snooker]], the situation in which the {{gli|cue ball}} is resting in contact with an {{gli|object ball}}.

{{Term| training template }}
{{Defn|1= [[File:Training template.png|thumb|right|Training template]]
A thin sheet of rigid material in the size and shape of a [[Rack (billiards)|physical ball rack]] (e.g. a {{gli|diamond}} for [[nine-ball]]), with holes drilled though it, which is used to make permanent {{gli|divot|divots}} in the [[Baize|cloth]] of the [[Billiard table|table]], one at a time for each [[Billiard ball|ball]] in the {{gli|rack|racking}} pattern, by placing a ball in one of the holes in the carefully placed template and tapping it sharply from above to create the cloth indentation.  The holes are spaced slightly closer than the regulation ball width of 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;inch (57.15&amp;nbsp;mm) apart, so that when the balls settle partially into their divots, the outer sides of these indentations create ball-on-ball pressure, pushing the balls together tightly.  The purpose of the template is to do away with using a physical rack, with racking instead being performed simply by placing the balls into position, and the divots aligning them into the tightest possible formation automatically. This prevents accidental loose racks, and also thwarts the possibility of cheating by carefully manipulating the ball positions while racking. The [[European Pocket Billiard Federation]] (EPBF, Europe's [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]] affiliate organization) has adopted this racking technique for its professional Euro-Tour event series.&lt;ref name="Varner BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Nick|last=Varner|date=February 2008|title=Killing Me Softly?: The Outbreak of the Soft Break Threatens the Game of 9-ball|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also {{gli|racking template}}, {{gli|pocket template}}.'' }}

Whether the ball is an {{gli|object ball}} or an opponent's cue ball depends upon the type of game (some have two cue balls).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13206">In [[baseball]], a '''golden sombrero''' is a player's inglorious feat of [[strikeout|striking out]] four times in a single game.

==Origin of the term==
The term derives from ''[[hat trick]]'', and since four is bigger than three, the rationale was that a four-strikeout performance should be referred to by a bigger hat, such as a [[sombrero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Reference – "Golden Sombrero"|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Golden_Sombrero}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[San Diego Padres]] player [[Carmelo Martínez]] in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baseballhotcorner.com/on-cans-of-corn-and-the-origin-of-baseball-terms/|title=On Cans Of Corn And The Origin Of Baseball Terms|website=baseballhotcorner.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in print when [[Leon Durham]] was quoted as using it in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'', third edition, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;  

The "[[List of baseball jargon (O)#Olympic Rings|Olympic Rings]]" or '''platinum sombrero''' applies to a player striking out five times in a game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Extra bases | date=April 9, 2005 | work=[[The Post-Standard|Syracuse Post-Standard]] | first=Matt | last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a '''horn''' (after [[Sam Horn]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles]], who accomplished the feat in an extra-inning game in 1991),&lt;ref name=neyer&gt;Rob Neyer [http://www.baseballnation.com/2013/6/21/4450534/five-strikeouts-platinum-sombrero-sam-horn-nickname article] at Baseball Nation&lt;/ref&gt; '''titanium sombrero''' or  '''double platinum sombrero''' is bestowed upon a player who strikes out six times in a single game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spots.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=kurkjian_tim&amp;id=2988373|title=ESPN – More amazing stories to watch for – MLB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Horn" for a six-strikeout game was coined by Orioles pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] after Horn's six strikeout game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1139973/index.htm Tom Verducci article], ''Sports Illustrated'', July 29, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{recentism|section|date=April 2018}}
[[Sammy Sosa]] and [[Ray Lankford]] are the only players to hit for a platinum sombrero more than twice.&lt;ref name=neyer/&gt; Only eight players have had six strikeouts, [[#Major league players with six strikeouts in a game|listed below]].&lt;ref name=neyer/&gt;  All eight players who accomplished a "Horn" needed extra innings to do it; the record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game is five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_strike1.shtml|title=Strikeout Records for Hitters by Baseball Almanac|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2009, [[Tampa Bay Rays]] third baseman [[Evan Longoria]] went 2 for 6, recording a golden sombrero and 2 home runs.  The second home run was a [[walk off home run]].  This feat was also accomplished by [[Brandon Moss]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]] on April 30, 2013 in a 19-inning game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/9227476/astounding-facts-oakland-los-angeles-angels-marathon-game|title=Jayson Stark Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are the only players to record four strikeouts and two home runs (the second a walk-off) in a single game in the [[live-ball era]].

On May 29, 2014, in a game against the [[New York Mets]], [[Ryan Howard]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] earned his 24th career Golden Sombrero, surpassing [[Reggie Jackson]] to take the all-time MLB lead for this statistic.

On May 29, 2015 [[San Diego Padres]] catcher [[Derek Norris]] struck out swinging in his first four plate appearances, then hit a walk-off grand slam, becoming the first MLB player in the modern era to achieve a golden sombrero and a walk-off grand slam in the same game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/derek-norris-hits-walkoff-grand-slam-after-striking-out-four-times-060731218.html|title=Derek Norris hits walkoff grand slam after striking out four times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2016 [[New York Yankees]] player [[Alex Rodriguez]] became the first MLB player to earn a Golden Sombrero after the age of 40 while having earned one before the age of 20. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feinsand, Mark|title=Alex Rodriguez sports Golden Sombrero in return to Yankees’ lineup|publisher=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/alex-rodriguez-earns-golden-sombrero-return-yankees-lineup-article-1.2732590|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2017, [[Chicago Cubs]] Second baseman [[Ian Happ]] went 1 for 5, recording a golden sombrero and a grand slam.

On July 25, 2017, [[Chicago Cubs]] infielder [[Javier Baez]] went 0 for 5, recording a platinum sombrero. On the same day, [[Seattle Mariners]] designated hitter [[Nelson Cruz]] went 0 for 6 with five strikeouts, also recording a platinum sombrero. This marked the first time in Major League history in which two players from two different games achieved platinum sombreros in the same day (although due to extra innings, Cruz's fifth strikeout technically occurred on July 26).

On October 11, 2017, Chicago Cubs third baseman [[Kris Bryant]] went 0 for 4, recording a golden sombrero, on the same day as New York Yankees right fielder [[Aaron Judge]], who went 0 for 5 and recorded his own golden sombrero, his third in the [[2017 American League Division Series|ALDS]] and making him the only player since 1903 to accomplish this.

Prior to the start of the World Series, golden sombreros in the 2017 postseason had already tied the record set in 1997. An increase in the use of starting pitchers as relievers has been suggested as a cause. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baer, Bill|title=There have been a lot of players wearing golden sombreros this postseason|publisher=NBCSports|date=October 11, 2017|url=http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2017/10/11/there-have-been-a-lot-of-players-wearing-golden-sombreros-this-postseason/|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2018, [[Giancarlo Stanton]] recorded a platinum sombrero in his home debut in his first season for the New York Yankees, following him leading the majors in home runs and winning the National League MVP the season before. Stanton left the field after his fifth strikeout to a chorus of home field boos. Just five days later he became the first player to ever record two platinum sombreros in one season when he went 0-7 and struck out for a fifth time with two runners and the Yankees down by one to end the game in extra innings versus the Baltimore Orioles. Stanton later recorded a golden sombrero in Game 1 of the [[2018 American League Division Series]], his second career playoff game.

On June 4, 2018, [[Aaron Judge]] earned a platinum sombrero, but more importantly struck out eight times, over course of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers, setting a new MLB record. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron Judge struck out 8 times Monday, setting new MLB record|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/aaron-judge-struck-8-times-monday-setting-new-mlb-record-023701865.html|publisher=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2018, [[Oakland Athletics]] outfielder [[Dustin Fowler]] recorded a platinum sombrero. 

The record for strikeouts in a single game in all of professional baseball belongs to [[minor league baseball]] player Khalil Lee of the  [[Lexington Legends]], who in 2017 struck out eight times in a twenty-one inning baseball game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=July 13, 2017|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?t=g_box&amp;did=milb&amp;gid=2017_07_13_lexafx_delafx_1|website=milb.com|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Forest Park Balloon Race''' is an annual [[hot air balloon festival]] held in [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. With more than 70 entrants and 130,000 spectators, it is the most well-attended single-day hot air balloon race in the United States.&lt;ref name="racehist"&gt;[http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/history.htm Great Forest Park Balloon Race: History].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first race was launched by Nikki Caplan and John O'Toole in December 1973 at a gathering of six balloons and twenty spectators.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/MO/200003213.html Library of Congress: Balloon Race].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, organization of the race passed from Caplan and O'Toole to a group of four novice balloonists who continue to coordinate the event today. These men are John Marlow, John Schaumburg, Ted Staley, and Dan Schettler, who formed a ballooning group known as the Mississippi River Balloon Transit Company. This company now is the host of the largest and most well attended balloon race.&lt;ref name="racehist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mississippi River Balloon Transit|title=Great Forest Park Balloon Race|url=http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/|accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 2000, the race was honored by the American Folklife Center at the [[Library of Congress]] as a local legacy after a nomination by then-[[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Dick Gephardt]].&lt;ref name="racehist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; So now, the Great Forest Park Balloon Race is forever documented through photographs, advertisements, media, and pilot rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mississippi River Balloon Transit Company|title=History of the Race|url=http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/history.htm|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:St. Louis Forest Park Ballon Glow -Sep 05.jpg|thumb|Balloon Glow in September 2005]]
On the day before the race, the [[hot air balloons]] participate in the Balloon Glow, a [[night glow]] opportunity for spectators to walk among inflated balloons illuminated by their burners.&lt;ref name="racesched"&gt;[http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/schedule.htm Great Forest Park Balloon Race: Schedule].{{verify credibility|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Balloon Glow and a [[fireworks]] show, during the week of the event, a free public orchestral concert by the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] is held on nearby Art Hill, adjacent to the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]]. During the race, the balloonists attempt to "chase" a 166-foot balloon of a pink bunny after taking off from the Central Fields in Forest Park.&lt;ref name="slfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slfp.com/ETC-BalloonRace.htm|publisher=St. Louis Front Page|date=September 19, 2009|title=Great Forest Park Balloon Race - Energizer Bunny Birthday Celebration Takes the Cake|last=Moore|first=Betty|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to follow the bunny until it lands, and then each pilot drops a sandbag or birdseed bag as close as possible to the bunny balloon. The winner is decided based on which pilots's sandbag, or birdseed bag, is the closest to the bunny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mississippi RIver Balloon Transit Company|title=Race Schedule|url=http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/schedule.htm|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to its urban location in the city of St. Louis, the race is considered "particularly prestigious and challenging", and participation is by invitation only. At times, landing sites have included backyards, baseball diamonds, golf courses, street intersections, and the convent grounds of the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; The balloon race is accompanied by a festival that includes food and drink, [[inflatable castle]]s, and a [[climbing wall]].&lt;ref name="slfp"/&gt;

The '''Great Kurultáj''' or briefly '''Kurultáj''' is a traditional event of peoples of [[Central Asia]]n nomadic origins, which takes place in the first week of August in [[Bugac]], [[Hungary]]. The aim of this event is to strengthen the unity of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Eurasian steppe]]-[[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic]] horse culture and traditions between [[Hungarians]] and their cultural relatives, eastern Turkic peoples and Altaic peoples. The first Kurultaj was held in the [[Torgai]] region of [[Kazakhstan]] in 2007. The first Kurultaj in Hungary was held in 2008. These events contributed much to the revival of the [[Pan-Turanism|Altaic]] self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Imre Laslotsky, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Hungary to Kazakhstan: [http://e-history.kz/media/upload/1846/2014/07/01/f88b174f8a3314c68ce6d01a974d6eb0.pdf  "Exploring own Origins"], by Daniyar Kassymov. In: International popular scientific historical magazine "Mangilik El: in the stream of History", registered in the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Certificate No.13768-Zh. Page 13. 02.08.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurultaj is a widely attended event for professional [[Equestrianism|horsemen]] and fans of horse riding. Each Kurultaj holds the parade of horsemen, [[horse race]]s, traditional horsemen wrestling, and various tournaments. Only Hungary, among European nations, has preserved the traditional [[kokpar]] game, a strategic [[team sport]] for riders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deviantart.com/print/36272121/ KURULTAJ – tribal assembly of the Hun – Turkic nations, celebration of the preservation of the ancient traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The word ”kurultaj” and its variations in the [[Turkic languages]] translates as “meeting of the tribes”. It occurs amongst tribal nations and practically in all the nomadic cultures. Hungarian nomadic tribes also held these meetings, a fact that is mentioned in Byzantine and Arab written sources. At such meetings, important decisions were made, in particular, the leaders of the tribes would meet often to discuss military decisions and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Official website of Kurultáj - [http://kurultaj.hu/english/ "Information: History of Kurultaj"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Kurultaj of 2013 took place from 9 to 11 August.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/photo/the-kurultaj-festival-takes-place-in-hungary-328266.html ''Kurultaj Festival delves into Hungarian history''] in ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' on August 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurultaj of 2014 took place at [[Bugac]] in the [[Southern Great Plain]] region in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynewshungary.com/kurultaj-nomadic-culture-and-tribal-traditions-photo-gallery/ ''KURULTAJ – Nomadic Culture and Tribal Traditions''] in ''Daily News Hungary'' on August 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of 2015 were organized by the [[Hungarian Turan Foundation]] with contributions from the [[Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency]] (TİKA) and named the year's event Ancestors Day. Representatives from the governments of Hungary and [[Turkey]] joined the festivities as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailysabah.com/history/2015/08/18/turkey-hungary-jointly-commemorate-atilla-the-hun Turkey, Hungary jointly commemorate Atilla the Hun]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guerreiros do Almirante''' (in English, ''Admiral Warriors'') is the ''[[barra brava]]'' of [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]. They are commonly known as ''Loucos da Saída 3'' (in English, ''Exit 3 Mads''), because of their localization in [[Estádio São Januário|São Januário]] bleachers, and ''A Barra Mais Louca'' (in English, ''The Most Mad Barra''), because of their passion, cheering unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lancenet.com.br/resenhadacolina/2014/09/27/quem-optou-pelo-vasco-ontem-recebeu-um-presente-da-equipe/ The mads of Guerreiros do Almirante - Lance!Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After seen a poor support from Vasco da Gama fans in [[2006 Copa do Brasil#Finals|Copa do Brasil finals in 2006]], friends started conversations about a creation of a new supporters group unnamed yet. It was decided that group would be a barra brava, unlike the common ''[[Torcida organizada|torcidas organizadas]]'' in Brazil. ''Guerreiros do Almirante'' was the chosen name and a [[Orkut]] community was created to meet people for the barra. The first Guerreiros reunion was in August 8. In August 16, Guerreiros appeared for the first time in a stadium, in a match against [[Associação Desportiva São Caetano|São Caetano]] in São Januário. In August 31, in a match against [[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta|Ponte Preta]] in São Januário, Guerreiros premiered its musical instruments and ''barras'' (vertical rags).

=== Songs adaptations and compositions ===
Guerreiros are known by their songs. Since its emergence, various songs to support Vasco da Gama appeared. The most famous is ''"Anna Julia Vascaína"'', a version of [[Los Hermanos]] hit ''"Anna Julia"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Noticia/Futebol/Vasco/0,,MUL265095-4283,00-ANNA+JULIA+VIRA+HIT+VASCAINO.html 'Anna Julia' turns a vascaíno hit - GloboEsporte.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 boom and acknowledgement ===
In December 2013, a shocking struggle between [[Clube Atlético Paranaense|Atlético Paranaense's]] ''Os Fanáticos'' and Vasco da Gama's ''Força Jovem'' in [[Joinville]] resulted a one-year ban for these torcidas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEFg4HnNnbw Vandalism and brawl between Atlético Paranaense and Vasco da Gama torcidas - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the main torcida organizada of Vasco da Gama caused a Guerreiros increase, getting – even it can be temporarily – a main role in São Januário and other Brazilian stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkut.com.br/Main#Community?cmm=603745 Torcida organizada's ban makes a increase of barra brava without criminal register - UOL Esporte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919135112/http://www.orkut.com.br/Main |date=2013-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}
'''Gymkhana''' is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] event consisting of speed pattern racing and timed games for riders on [[horse]]s.  These events often emphasize children's participation and may be organized by a recognized [[Pony Club]] or a [[4-H]] club.  In parts of the western United States, this type of competition is usually called an "'''O-Mok-See'''" (also spelled "omoksee" or without hyphenation as "o mok see") competition, a term derived from a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] phrase said to mean "games on horseback."  Very small events with little or no prize money, designed for beginners or riders at a local level, are sometimes called '''playdays'''.   Gymkhana is the word used in most of the rest of the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom, and both the east and west coasts of the United States.

== Types of events ==

Gymkhana and o-mok-see classes include timed speed events such as  [[barrel racing]], [[pole bending]], [[keyhole race]], keg race (also known as "down and back"), [[Flag Racing|flag racing]], and stake race. Some organizations include ride and run, musical mats, egg stomp, $1 bill race or "ride a buck", and sack race. 

Most of these events are designed to display precise, controlled actions and tight teamwork between horse and rider at speed, and demonstrate many skills such as  [[flying change|flying lead chang]]es, sliding stops and more.  Most clubs offer a variety of classes for all ages and abilities of people, allowing riders to compete at the speed level at which they are most capable and comfortable.

==O-Mok-See==
O-Mok-See or omoksee is the most common term used in the Western United States for events in the sport of pattern horse racing. Most events are run with contestants simultaneously running in 4 separate lanes (3 for small arenas), with each contestant riding in a 30 foot wide lane. The origin of the term "O-Mok-See" is thought to specifically originate with the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]] people where they described a particular style of riding as "oh-mak-see pass-kan" meaning "riding big dance".  This event was thought to be a war ceremony; before setting out on a mounted expedition against the enemy, the warriors of the camp performed this dance as a part of the prelude of stirring up courage and enthusiasm for battle. The warriors put on their finest dress attire, decorated and painted their best horses, carrying their war bundles, shields, lances and bonnets. They mounted and gathered at some distance out of sight of the camp. They turned and rode together at full speed into the great camp circle, circled around it once and then rode to the center of the camp. In the center were a number of old men and women who sang special songs and beat drums for the horsemen. The horsemen then rode their trained horses to the rhythm of the singers and drummers. From time to time the riders dismounted and danced about on foot beside their horses, shooting in the air and shouting to one another to be brave when the battle came. If anyone fell from his horse during the ceremony it was considered an omen of bad luck.

===National Saddle Clubs Association===
The National Saddle Clubs Association (NSCA) was established in January 1965 as the first national organization of saddle clubs. The NSCA held its first national championship show in 1966.  The NSCA has adopted and promotes the sport of "pattern horse racing" under the term O-Mok-See. They encourage and allow families to compete together. The NSCA has adopted a set of pattern horse racing events for national competition . some of the events that they run are pole bending, California stake race, polo, key, international flags, Idaho figure-eight and two barrel Flags. There are also 10 or so more events in their rule book.  Through standardized rules and regulations for pattern horse racing events, the NSCA's prime purpose and objectives are to promote and cultivate cooperation and friendly relationships between saddle clubs throughout the United States.

'''House Park''' is a 6,000-6,500 seat [[American football]] stadium in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] that is owned and operated by the [[Austin Independent School District]]. Unlike many school districts in Texas, AISD uses multiple shared stadiums including House Park for use in athletic events rather than building a stadium for each high school.

==History==
On October 31, 1938, the Public Works Administration (PWA) offered the City of Austin a grant not to exceed $613,127 to cover 45% of the costs of school buildings, a stadium and field house, and additions and alterations to existing school buildings, including necessary equipment and acquisition of necessary land under PWA Docket No. Texas-2134-F. House Park was built using a portion of this funding package. Giesecke &amp; Harris designed the project and J. R. Blackmore &amp; Sons built it.

House Park opened in fall 1939 along [[Shoal Creek (Texas)|Shoal Creek]], just down the hill from the old campus of [[Austin High School (Austin, Texas)|Austin High School]] near downtown.  The stadium was built on land donated by [[Edward M. House]], a former diplomat and adviser to [[Woodrow Wilson]].  House Park was later dedicated to the memory of the Austin High students that lost their lives serving in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

==High school sports==
{{As of|2012}}, the stadium still serves as the home stadium for Austin High, as well as [[Anderson High School (Austin, Texas)|Anderson]], [[McCallum High School|McCallum]] and [[Lanier High School (Austin, Texas)|Lanier]] High Schools.  The absence of a [[Track and field|track]] sets it apart from most other high school stadiums in large cities, but it does also host [[soccer]] games and has in the past been the site of the Texas High School [[Lacrosse]] Championships.

==Professional sports==

House Park is the home of [[Austin Sol]], Austin's professional ultimate frisbee team. Their inaugural season home opener was April 9, 2016.

House Park is also the home of [[Austin Yellow Jackets]] of the [[Independent Women's Football League]].

In 2008, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with [[artificial turf]]. Fans were able to take patches of the grass turf as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinisd.org/newsmedia/releases/index.phtml?more=1548 Austin Independent School District]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2015, [[2015 Texas–Oklahoma floods|historic flooding]] along Shoal Creek damaged the stadium and turf forcing the [[Austin Aztex|Aztex]] to search for a temporary home.&lt;ref&gt;http://kxan.com/2015/05/26/aisd-assessing-house-park-after-floods/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each player has two juggling balls and a final ball is held by the server, who serves by throwing the ball into the opponent's side of the court. This must be "caught" by one of the opponents, by using the ball to perform a [[Cascade (juggling)#Three-ball|three-ball juggling pattern]] (commonly the three-ball cascade). They are allowed three catches before one of the balls (not necessarily the one that was served) must be thrown to another player, or passed back across the net. Like volleyball, only three passes are allowed by a team before the ball must be returned.

Teams score by causing the ball to land in the opponent's side of the court, causing the opposition to throw a ball out of bounds, or fail to complete a juggling pattern. Games are relatively informal, and players are encouraged to show off their juggling skills for spectators.

[[Image:Eugene W. Britt House, West Adams, Los Angeles.JPG|right|thumb|The foundation's main building]]The '''LA84 Foundation''' (known until June 2007 as the '''Amateur Athletic Foundation of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]''') is a private, nonprofit institution created by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee to manage Southern California's endowment from the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]]. Under an agreement made in 1979, 40 percent of any surplus was to stay in Southern California, with the other 60 percent going to the [[United States Olympic Committee]]. The total surplus was $232.5 million. Southern California's share was approximately $93 million.

The LA84 Foundation's mission&lt;ref name="la84who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/who/who_frmst.htm |title=About |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328111820/http://www.la84foundation.org/who/who_frmst.htm |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to promote and expand youth sports opportunities in Southern California and to increase knowledge of sport and its impact on people's lives. Since inception, the Foundation has invested more than $225 million in Southern California by awarding grants to youth sports organizations, initiating sports and coaching education programs, and operating the world's premier sports library.&lt;ref name="la84who"/&gt;

Grants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/1gm/over_frmst.htm |title=Grantmaking |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; are awarded to organizations that provide on-going, structured youth sports programs combining the essential elements of teaching, learning and competition. The Foundation makes grants in the eight southernmost counties of California ([[Imperial County, California|Imperial]], [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Orange County, California|Orange]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]], [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]]). Youth organizations in the Los Angeles area receive priority. The LA84 Foundation has made grants to more than 1,100 Southern California organizations since 1985.

The LA84 Foundation has initiated programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/2ysp/over_frmst.htm |title=Youth Sports Programs |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to meet the youth sports needs of Southern California and to create models that can be applied elsewhere. These include the LA84 Foundation Coaching Education Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/3ce/over_frmst.htm |title=Coaching Education |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as large-scale sports programs such as Summer Swim and Run 4 Fun, which serve nearly 20,000 children and teenagers each year.

The Foundation's headquarters is the historic [[Eugene W. Britt House]], a [[National Register of Historic Places|Registered Historic Place]] located at 2141 West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles' [[Jefferson Park, Los Angeles, California|Jefferson Park]] neighborhood. It was formerly a sports museum that featured the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]]'s collection of sports books, film, photographs and memorabilia. [[First Interstate Bancorp|First Interstate Bank]] and the Peter and Ginny Ueberroth Foundation donated the Helms Collection, house and grounds to the LA84 Foundation in the summer of 1985.

The Paul Ziffren Sports Resource Center houses the world's premier sports library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/4sl/over_frmst.htm |title=Sports Library &amp; Digital Collection |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221003809/http://la84foundation.org/4sl/over_frmst.htm |archivedate=2013-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The library maintains an extensive collection of books, periodicals, photograph and moving footage, with a special emphasis on the [[Olympic Games]]. The traditional library has been supplemented by the development of an extensive electronic collection of 100,000 PDFs including scholarly publications, popular magazine and primary historical documents available at no cost on the LA84 Foundation website.

The LA84 Foundation also hosts conferences and sponsors research on a variety of sport topics. The LA84 Foundations practical knowledge, acquired through years of direct involvement in youth sports, combined with its wide range of education services enables the Foundation to serve as a leading forum for the exchange of ideas and exploration of issues in sport.

In June 2007, the Foundation adopted the name LA84 Foundation to establish a unique identity and honor the spirit of the 1984 Olympic Games, which created the Foundation's endowment.

The [[Swimming at the 1932 Summer Olympics|swimming]] stadium used for the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympic Games]] has been renamed the LA84 Foundation/John C. Argue Swim Stadium.  Argue was instrumental in bringing the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles.  He later served as chair of the LA84 Foundation.

Like the LFL, players in the LBL wear revealing outfits instead of traditional uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2025835/Lingerie-Basketball-League-Los-Angeles-hopes-lure-male-fans.html|title=Slam dunk against feminism?

The Lingerie Basketball League held its inaugural season in 2011 with four [[Los Angeles]] based teams. The L.A. Beauties won the first championship.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The LBL held a second season in 2012, but there was no championship game. A championship game between the L.A. Divas and L.A. Glam was announced, but never held.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The LBL did not play in 2013 and is currently inactive.

'''Macron S.p.A.''' is an Italian sporting apparel company, based in [[Crespellano]], [[Province of Bologna|Bologna]]. It is considered a European leader in the production of active sportswear.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;

Macron operates in three main business areas:

* Teamwear: for [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], [[handball]], [[five-a-side football]] and [[Running events|running]].
* Merchandising: official kits, free-time apparel and accessories for the supporters of Macron's sponsored clubs.
* Leisurewear: sports-inspired apparel for those wishing to wear Macron off the field.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;
{{TOC limit|4}}

==History==
Macron was founded in 1971 as a distributor of American sportswear brands in Italy.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt; A major expansion of the organization took place in 1994, coincident with relocation and consolidation to [[Crespellano]].&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;

Macron began providing teamwear to [[Professionalism in association football|professional football]] in 2001, its first contract being with [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;  Expansion beyond the domestic Italian market began in 2005.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;

In 2014, Macron secured a four-year agreement with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for [[naming rights]] to their home stadium, resulting in renaming in July 2014 to [[Macron Stadium]].&lt;ref name="boltonpr2014" /&gt;  Macron supplanted [[Reebok]] as the stadium namesake, and will provide the club's kit.&lt;ref name="boltonpr2014" /&gt;

==Corporate governance==
{{As of|2014}}, Macron's [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) was Gianluca Pavanello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=224331982 | title=Gianluca Pavanello | accessdate=12 Feb 2015 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2014}}, the company's [[President (corporate title)|president]] was Francesco Bromioli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/people/17038730-francesco-bormioli | title=Francesco Bormioli, Macron SpA | accessdate=12 Feb 2015 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsorships and customers ==
Macron [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] or co-sponsors a variety of organizations, teams and events.  In many cases, the wording of published accounts does not make a clear demarcation between a case where a team has purchased [[Kit (association football)|kit]]  (''aka'' uniforms or strip) versus those whose kit has been provided as a matter of sponsorship.  Following is a partial list of these sponsorship/customer relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11556">The '''Original Mountain Marathon''' (OMM), formerly known as the '''[[Karrimor]] International [[Mountain Marathon]]''' (or KIMM), and initially simply '''The Karrimor''', is a two-day Mountain event, held in a different region across the UK every year. It was first held in 1968 and continues today.  Gerry Charnley, a skilled [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] and [[orienteering|orienteer]], designed the KIMM to test [[orienteering]] skills in extreme circumstances; the full-length KIMM course is a double-marathon length race.  Each team must carry all their gear, including equipment for an overnight camp.  Moreover, the course is not disclosed until the race begins, so each team must have good navigation skills.  Some have called the KIMM the forerunner of modern [[adventure racing]].

==History== 

For its first 8 years, the event was known as 'The Karrimor'. In addition to the 'Elite category' double marathon, other course lengths have been added over the years to suit a greater variety of competitors (see 'Classes of competition' below). The core elements remain, however: there is always an overnight camp and the teams of two must be self-sufficient. 

The KIMM name was adopted in 1976.&lt;ref name="CompasssportonKIMM"&gt;[http://www.compasssport.co.uk/index.php/news-mainmenu-27/55-from-kimm-to-omm History of 'the Karrimor'/ KIMM/ OMM from compasssport.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Galloway in 1976 which experienced exceptionally bad weather with only 30% completing, Gerry Charnley spoke in a TV interview with the BBC: "Don't you think this event is too tough?" asked the interviewer, and Charnley responded: "Everybody knows this is the KIMM, the toughest event on the calendar and it's not a Sunday afternoon picnic.&lt;ref name=CompasssportonKIMM/&gt;" This attitude has remained throughout the events history and places it as one of the most challenging mountain marathons in the world.

In 1977, a special map from Harvey Maps was commissioned. 

In 2004 the event became known as the OMM after Karrimor's sponsorship was withdrawn.

{{wikinewsart|All 2500 runners in Lake District race accounted for after flood}}
The 2008 OMM was abandoned, for the first time in the race's history, due to ill-informed media coverage which suggested that the very challenging weather conditions (100&amp;nbsp;mph winds and extremely heavy rain) placed competitors and potential rescuers in danger. Reference was made to '1,700 people unaccounted for in the hills' though in fact all of these were still competing and unaware that anyone was concerned for them; as usual a significant number of competitors were current or former [[Mountain Rescue]] Team members. In fact only one competitor needed to be rescued after being swept away in a torrent, slightly injured and stranded on an island, though there were other unconnected rescues in the Lake District at the time which were widely assumed to be connected to the OMM. Flooding did cause considerable disruption and damage at the base camps and the high winds resulted in the abandonment of some of the manned radio checkpoints; this and the genuine risk at river crossings were the principal reasons for cancelling the second day's competition.

In January 2010 the ownership of OMM, the event and the products was bought by Ark Consultants UK Ltd.

In 2013, the organisers of the Original Mountain Marathon revealed plans for a summer version of the event, along with a mountain biking marathon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2013/05/09/may-omm-lite-mountain-marathon-aims-to-tempt-newcomers 'omm lite mountain marathon aims to tempt newcomers' at grough.co.uk/magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==OMM Brand==

OMM have also started producing their own branded outdoor clothing and equipment. Items required on the event, such as waterproof jackets and trousers, backpacks and sleeping bags, have been produced, specially adapted for the event.
The [[Kamleika]] (from the [[Aleut language|Aleutian]] word for a long waterproof robe) range of jackets, smocks and trousers have become famous amongst mountain marathon runners and hikers alike. They are unique in that they are specially developed to be stretchy and produce minimal noise when running. OMM have a larger range of clothing and equipment, also specially created for mountain marathons.

==Swiss KIMM==

1976 Swiss Orienteer [[Dieter Wolf]] brought the Karrimor International Mountain Marathon idea from England to Switzerland: 47 teams were at the start of the first Swiss Karrimor 2-day Mountain Marathon in Muothatal in 1976. Over the years several thousand lovers of the mountains, nature, orienteering and adventure sports from more than twenty countries have been able to participate in many different regions of the [[Swiss Alps]].

After some structural and personal changes at Karrimor ltd. in England and Salewa Sport ltd. in Switzerland a new partner had to be found for the event in 1997 so as to achieve a balanced account. Arova-Mammut, a Swiss firm manufacturing [[mountain sport]] equipment, stepped in spontaneously, so that the event had to be changed only little; under a new name its organisation would be secure for the next few years.  The long cooperation with [[Arova-Mammut ltd.]] came to an end in 2002.

[[R’adys Outdoor &amp; Snowwear]] in Lachen became a new sponsor in 2004. 2013 R'adys sponsorship ended and the Event is now called SIMM (Swiss International Mountain Marathon).

This Mountain Marathon is unique in Switzerland.

The '''Professional Bowls Association''' is an international organisation which promotes [[Bowls]] worldwide and organises competitions, including the [[World Indoor Bowls Championships]] with other Bowls Associations. It also operates as the world governing body for Bowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the website.|url=http://www.professionalbowlsassociation.com/|publisher=Professional Bowls Association|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1990 the sport was under a period of fragmentation following the loss of the television coverage connected with the World Indoor Championships. John Hall the President of the [[Bowls England|English Bowls Association]] unsuccessfully called for closer co-operation between the indoor and outdoor game. In addition there were 20 national associations and authorities, a crown Green Association and short mat rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newby|first=Donald|title=Daily Telegraph Bowls Yearbook 91|pages= 8/9|year=1990|publisher=Pan Books Ltd|isbn=0-330-31664-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a player led organisation formed the Professional Bowls Association (PBA), during the [[1992 World Indoor Bowls Championship]], which were held in the [[Preston Guildhall]] to promote Bowls worldwide and on television.

===Formation of the WBT===
On 1 January 1997, under the then chairman [[Richard Corsie]], the PBA created the [[World Bowls Tour]] and after the [[1997 World Indoor Bowls Championship|1997 championship]] replaced the World Indoor Bowls Council as the leading indoor organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/8HbKp8|title=Jones, David Rhys. "New body defended by Corsie." Times, 1 Jan. 1997, p. 29|publisher=Times Digital Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the World Bowls Tour was to set up and create championships and competitions to further the aims of the PBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About WBT|url=http://www.worldbowlstour.com/about-wbt|work=Webpage|publisher=WBT/World Bowls Tour|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Organisational Structure==

===Branches &amp; Location===
The PBA has branches across the world, within Europe, in the UK (where the organisation was set up). It also has branches including in the United States, [[South Africa]] and Australia.

===The PBA Committee===
The PBA Committee is the main organ of the Professional Bowls Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBA Committee members|url=http://www.professionalbowlsassociation.com/about-us/committee-members/|work=Webpage|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raw Run''' is recognized colloquially within the [[longboarding]] community as a recorded video showcasing the entire descent down a hill, from top to bottom. This is typically done all in one [[take]] to showcase the rider's consistency and skill.

== Notable Examples ==

[[Colorado]] native and longboarder, Zak Maytum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/09/09/watch-zak-maytum-longboards-near-70-mph-in-colorado/28161/|title = WATCH: Zak Maytum longboards near 70 mph in Colorado|date = September 9, 2015|accessdate = September 9, 2015|website = WATCH: Zak Maytum longboards near 70 mph in Colorado|publisher = The Denver Post|last = Nguyen|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; made national news when a video of him descending a roadway reportedly achieving 70&amp;nbsp;mph went [[Viral video|viral]]. The [[YouTube]] video titled "Raw Run: Zak Maytum" reached one million views in under two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fOVXndyjAo|title = Raw Run: Zak Maytum|date = 2015-09-08|accessdate = 2015-09-09|website = Raw Run: Zak Maytum|publisher = Youtube|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Roll of Honour''' is a list established by the [[Scottish Football Association]] recognising players who have gained 50 or more international [[cap (football)|caps]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. The roll of honour was launched in February 1988, when 11 players had already achieved the distinction.&lt;ref name = "sfa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138 |publisher=[[Scottish Football Association]]|accessdate=11 March 2017|title=International Roll of Honour |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032517/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138 |archivedate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player inducted receives a commemorative gold medal, an invitation to every Scotland home match and has their portrait hung in the [[Scottish Football Museum]].&lt;ref name = "sfa"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}} there are 31 players on the roll of honour. [[Craig Gordon]] is the most recent addition, having won his 50th cap on 5 October 2017 against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].

In July 2017, the SFA launched the Women's International Roll of Honour, which recognises players who have won 100 or more caps for [[Scotland women's national football team|Scotland Women's National Team]]. The women's roll of honour initially included 12 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/news/women-s-international-roll-of-honour-unveiled/ |title=Women’s International Roll of Honour unveiled |work= |publisher=Scottish Football Association |date=10 July 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shaul Paul Ladany''' ({{lang-he|שאול לדני}}; born April 2, 1936) is an Israeli [[Holocaust survivor]], [[racewalker]] and two-time Olympian. He set and still holds the world record in the 50-mile walk (7:23:50), and the Israeli national record in the 50-kilometer walk (4:17:07). He is a former world champion in the 100-kilometer walk.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Renee Ghert-Zand|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/healthcare/healthiness_long_distance_walker|title=The Healthiness of a Long-Distance Walker|publisher=The Jewish Week|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=David B.|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/questions-answers-a-conversation-with-shaul-p-ladany-1.268137|title=Questions &amp; Answers/A conversation with Shaul P. Ladany|publisher=Haaretz|date=January 14, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladany survived the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in 1944, when he was eight years old. In 1972, he survived the [[Munich Massacre]]. He is now a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Management at [[Ben Gurion University]], has authored over a dozen books and 120 scholarly papers, and reportedly speaks nine languages. He lives in [[Omer, Israel|Omer]], Israel.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;

Asked if it would be fair to call him the ultimate survivor, Ladany laughed and answered: "I don't know about that. What I can say is that in my life there has never been a dull moment."&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blavo|first=John|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/shaul-ladany-the-long-walk-through-horrors-of-20th-century-1206199.html|title=Shaul Ladany: The long walk through horrors of 20th century|publisher=The Independent|date= December 21, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and family life==
Ladany was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]]. He has two sisters, Shosh (two years older) and Marta (five years younger, actually his first cousin, adopted by his parents as she was six months old).&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/la/shaul-ladany-1.html|title=Shaul Ladany Bio, Stats, and Results|publisher=Sports-reference.com|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishsports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsports.net/BioPages/Shaul-Ladany.htm|title=Shaul Ladany profile|publisher=Jewishsports.net|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Shosh have been married for over 50 years, and have a daughter and three grandchildren who live in [[Modi'in]].&lt;ref name="thejewishweek2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/tears-as-day-of-deliverance-from-belsen-recalled-1-708065|title=Tears as day of deliverance from Belsen recalled |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=April 16, 2005|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Yocheved Miriam Russo|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Books/Article.aspx?id=129407|title=Setting the record straight|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=January 15, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentration camp==
During the [[Holocaust]] in Europe, Ladany's maternal grandmother and grandfather were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where, Ladany has said, they "were made into [[Soap made from human corpses|soap]]."&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKZa91YO_4YC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20Ladany&amp;f=false|title=One Day in September: The Full Story of the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and the Israeli Revenge Operation "Wrath of God"|author=Simon Reeve|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2011|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Simon|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/shaul-ladany-still-king-of-the-road-6295322.html|title=Shaul Ladany: Still king of the road – Olympics|publisher=The Independent|date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1941, when he was five years old, the Germans attacked Belgrade and the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II#German bombing|bombed his home]]. His parents fled with him to Hungary.&lt;ref name="maccabi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maccabi.com.au/News/1198/Israeli-champions-long-march.cfm|author=Charly Wegman|title=Israeli champion's long march|publisher=Maccabi Australia|date=June 14, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, when he was eight years old they tried to hide him in a monastery for safekeeping, warning him to keep secret the fact that he was Jewish. He was terrified the entire time that he would be discovered, but says that after that experience he wasn't afraid of anything.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

In 1944, the eight-year-old was captured by the [[Nazi]]s with his parents, and shipped to the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maccabi1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/27/sport/olympics-2012-munich-shaul-ladany-survivor|author=James Montague|title=The Munich massacre: A survivor's story|publisher=CNN|date=September 5, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsinsports.org/Olympics.asp?sport=olympics&amp;ID=413|title=Ladany, Shaul |publisher=Jewsinsports.org|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qWbkG8Utw8C&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%20Ladany&amp;f=false|title=Going Far|author=Joe Henderson|year=2011|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his family were killed. But in December 1944, he was saved by American Jews who had paid a ransom to have a number of Jews, including him and his parents, released from the concentration camp, where 100,000 Jews had already been killed.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2464"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0dYzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LOsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2464,1876348&amp;dq=shaul+ladany&amp;hl=en|title=Belsen Survivor Escapes Death Again|publisher=The Miami News|date=September 6, 1972|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thejewishweek1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/healthcare/healthiness_long_distance_walker|author=Renee Ghert-Zand|title=The Healthiness Of A Long-Distance Walker|publisher=The Jewish Week|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladany recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw my father beaten by the [[SS]], and I lost most of my family there... A ransom deal that the Americans attempted saved 2,000 Jews and I was one. I actually went into the [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chamber]], but was reprieved. God knows why.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Describing the concentration camp, Major Dick Williams, one of the first British soldiers to enter and liberate the camp, said: "It was an evil, filthy place; a hell on Earth."&lt;ref name="scotsman1"/&gt; Ladany was one of the few of Yugoslavia's 70,000 Jews who survived the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; He visits the concentration camp every time he is in Europe. He was also there for the 50th anniversary of liberation, and when a Bergen-Belsen museum was dedicated.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;

He was brought on the [[Kastner train]] from Bergen-Belsen to Switzerland. After the war ended, he and his family moved back to Belgrade. In December 1948, when he was 12 years old, the family emigrated to Israel, which had just become a nation state.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thejewishweek1"/&gt;

==Education==
Ladany received his B.Sc. in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] in 1960, and an M.Sc. from Technion in 1961.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:UjohK-K5NYsJ:web.it.nctu.edu.tw/qtqm/qtqmpapers/2006V3N2/2006V3N2_F7.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjpgLERmlBsNf-dLzvWYyiQAmTtFhML_ZSIXZZIPLPf49_FFD35qm2PHBZbST1AvY2z7_6rB8yInzAIzRhtmtLPRPOjKBjYL5LubJAErW0Iy4L5v_8oIzuaREFGDYJ5OE8c5Z2A&amp;sig=AHIEtbSDX68zkmpapnkirE_YxK2OMG7HVw|title=Developing Formulas for Setting an Improved Double-Sampling Plan|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he earned a Graduate Diploma in [[Business Administration]] from [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google9"/&gt; In 1968, he was awarded the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Business Administration by [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; followed by [[postdoctoral research]] at [[Tel Aviv University]].

==Competitive walking career==
===Early career and Olympics===
Ladany began his competitive career as a [[marathon runner]] in Israel, when he was 18 years old.&lt;ref name="google6526"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EeIbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q2YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6526,2552697&amp;dq=shaul+ladany&amp;hl=en |title=Israeli Olympian Decries Walkout at Olympic Games|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=February 6, 1973|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked whether it wasn't true that race-walking looks funny, he responded: "But in the 1950s, when I started running, people also thought I was a nut. Jews didn't run. They would laugh."&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt; He explained further: "People thought of it only as punishment for soldiers."&lt;ref name="thejewishweek1"/&gt;

In his mid-twenties in the early 1960s, he switched to [[race walking]].&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt; Ladany walked his first race in 1962.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt; Commenting on the sport, he reflected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You need a certain type of mental attitude: a willingness to take punishment, to have a lack of comfort, and pain, to continue and continue. I'm not a psychologist, but was I stubborn, so I entered race walking? Or did I enter race walking, and become stubborn? It's the same in all long-distance events. Quitters don't win, and winners don't quit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1963, he won the first of his 28 Israeli national titles.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt; In 1966, he broke the oldest U.S. track record, which had stood since 1878, in the 50-mile-walk.&lt;ref name="google6526"/&gt;  In April 1968, he again broke the U.S. record in the 50-mile-walk, with a time of 8:05:18 in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://209.212.22.88/data/rbr/1960-1969/1968/1968.04.22.pdf|title=Ladany Wins Record Walk|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, at the age of 32, Ladany competed in his first Olympics – the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]  – in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's 50 kilometres walk|50-kilometer walk]] (31 miles, 121 yards) in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google5455"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d5BBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bqkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5455,419761&amp;dq=shaul+ladany&amp;hl=en|author=Ira Berkow|title=Dr Shaul Ladany is Entire Israeli Olympic Team|publisher=New York Times|date=May 10, 1972|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished in 24th place, with a time of 5 hours, 1 minute, and 6 seconds.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt; He trained and competed without a coach.&lt;ref name="google5455"/&gt;

At the [[8th Maccabiah Games]] in July 1969, he won a gold medal in the 3-km walk (13.35.4). Then at the [[1973 Maccabiah Games]], he won the [[10-km walk]] and the 50-km walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ladany+maccabiah&amp;dq=ladany+maccabiah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CYAvUcyrD8Lf0gG5kIDQDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA|title=King of the Road: The Autobiography of an Israeli Scientist and a World Record-Holding Race Walker|author=Shaul P.

In early 1972, Ladany set a world record in the [[50-mile walk]] in a time of 7:44:47, shattering the world mark that had stood since 1935.&lt;ref name="jewishsports1"/&gt; In April 1972, he lowered his world record to 7:23:50, in New Jersey; a world record time that still stands today.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google5455"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1744790962.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+19%2C+1974&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+%281837-1985%29&amp;desc=Ladany+training+to+win+Olympics+in+a+walk&amp;pqatl=google|author=Seymour S.

He also holds the Israeli national record in the 50-kilometer walk, at 4:17:07, which he also set in 1972.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/sports-shorts-1.229271|title=Sports Shorts – Israel News|publisher=Haaretz|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1972, he returned as the sole male member of the Israeli track and field team, to compete in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Men's 50 kilometres walk|50-kilometer walk]] in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]] in [[Munich]], Germany.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt; He said he wanted to show the Germans that a Jew had survived, and he wore a [[Star of David]] on his warm-up jersey.&lt;ref name="google2464"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlepi1972"&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=John|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Olympics-Flashback-1972-Terror-and-turmoil-1280301.php |title=Olympics Flashback: 1972: Terror and turmoil|publisher=seattlepi.com|date=July 24, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was congratulated by locals on his fluent German, he responded:  "I learned it well when I spent a year at Bergen Belsen".&lt;ref name="seattlepi1972"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofxl2juY25YC&amp;pg=PT382&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CM8BEOgBMB4|title=Ten Moments That Shook the Sports World: One Sportswriter's Eyewitness Accounts of the Most Incredible Sporting Events of the Past Fifty Years|author=Stan Isaacs|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2008|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about competing in Germany, the [[Holocaust survivor]] said: "I don't say I have to hate Germans. Of course not the younger generation, but I have no special sympathy for the older generation who have been accused of what happened in the Nazi period."&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

Ladany finished his race in 19th place, with a time of 4 hours, 24 minutes, and 38 seconds.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt; Asked how he felt, he replied: "Arrogant because of what the Germans did to me; proud because I am a Jew".&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; He then returned to the athletes' [[Olympic Village]] and went to sleep.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlepi1972"/&gt;

===Munich Massacre===
In the early hours of September 5, 1972, the [[Munich Massacre]] began. Eight rifle-carrying Palestinian terrorists, who were members of the [[Black September (group)|Black September]] faction of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], broke into the Israeli quarters in the Olympic Village to take the Israeli Olympic delegation athletes and coaches hostage.&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FsgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CJUBEOgBMBM#v=onepage&amp;q=Shaul%20Ladany&amp;f=false|author=Kenny Moore|title=Leading Men|publisher=Runner's World|date=April 2006|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TLvWXFIi0C&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0CMgBEOgBMB0#v=onepage&amp;q=Shaul%20Ladany&amp;f=false|title=Momentous Century: Personal and Eyewitness Accounts of the Rise of the Jewish Homeland and State, 1875–1978 |author=Levi Soshuk, Azriel Louis Eisenberg|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1984|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Neil Amdur,[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/sports/olympics/13ladany.html?_r=0 "Ladany, an Ultimate Survivor, Recalls Painful Memories"], ''New York Times'', July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorists captured wrestling coach [[Moshe Weinberg]]. They shot and killed Weinberg, and threw his body out a window onto the sidewalk.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwkrv-yn57MC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=Shaul+Ladany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AkcqUc7TLMW30AHts4CYCA&amp;ved=0COABEOgBMCE|title=Warrior Elite: 31 Heroic Special-Ops Missions from the Raid on Son Tay to the Killing of Osama Bin Laden|author=Nigel Cawthorne|publisher=Ulysses Press|year= 2011|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning somebody wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that was standing in the entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shootings at the Munich Olympics, Sporting Witness - BBC World Service|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00k2mxv|website=BBC|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another team member took Ladany to the window and pointed to the blood stains outside the apartment. They decided to leave the apartment via the rear of their apartment that backed onto a lawn, despite knowing that they would be visible to the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shootings at the Munich Olympics, Sporting Witness - BBC World Service|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00k2mxv|website=BBC|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terrorists from the second floor, from apartment number one, had a clear view from the window and we moved out, walked along the lawn without running or zigzagging but in strong and confident legs. Maybe it was stupid ? But we had done so....we left the apartment through the lawn.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is confirmed by surviving terrorist Jamal Al-Gashey who revealed that Ladany was spotted racing away from the building leading the terrorists to believe that they were too late to take any hostages in Apartment number two, though several were still inside the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=Simon|title=One day in September : the full story of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and the Israeli revenge operation "Wrath of God"|date=2000|publisher=Arcade|location=New York|isbn=1559705477|page=10|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladany ran around to the building housing the U.S. team and banged on the ground floor apartment belonging to the team coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=Simon|title=One day in September : the full story of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and the Israeli revenge operation "Wrath of God"|date=2000|publisher=Arcade|location=New York|isbn=1559705477|page=10|edition=1st U.S.|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He awoke the American track coach [[Bill Bowerman]], who alerted the German police.  Bowerman called for the U.S. Marines to come and protect American Jewish Olympians swimmer [[Mark Spitz]] and javelin thrower [[Bill Schmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prefontaine|first=Steve|title=Leading Men|journal=Runner's World|issue=April 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladany was the first person to spread the alert as to the attack, and was one of only five Israeli team members to escape. Weinberg and 10 other Israeli Olympic athletes and coaches were kidnapped and killed by the terrorists.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt;

A number of television, radio, and newspaper reports listed Ladany as one of those killed.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; One headline stated: "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time".&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; Ladany recalled later:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends came up to me and tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three Black September members survived and were arrested at a Munich prison, but the West German authorities decided to release them the following month in exchange for the hostages of hijacked [[Lufthansa Flight 615]]&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wwPNjSnxcYC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;lpg=PA439&amp;dq=lufthansa+615++olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rpRAKK0nfS&amp;sig=3XdM6nnMpR22VAbk5OCVz-BXlm8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XW4vUYyMEsfA0QHnu4CICw&amp;ved=0CIkBEOgBMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=lufthansa%20615%20%20olympics&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism|author=Peter Chalk|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2012|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenfeter|first=Yael|title=Israel in shock as Munich killers freed|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/israel-in-shock-as-munich-killers-freed-1.322811|accessdate=July 26, 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the released Black September members were later killed, as were others who organized the Munich Massacre, by Israeli's [[Mossad]] during [[Operation Wrath of God]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google8"/&gt;

In 1992, speaking of the massacre, Ladany said: "It's with me all the time, and I remember every detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joel Greenberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/06/sports/olympics-memory-of-massacre-is-kept-alive.html|title=Olympics; Memory of Massacre Is Kept Alive|publisher=New York Times|date=September 6, 1992|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visits the graves of his murdered teammates in Tel Aviv every year, on September 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=259154|title=Munich attack survivors return with mixed feelings|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided to not hold a [[minute of silence]] before the start of the 2012 Olympic Games, to honor the 11 Israeli Olympians who were killed 40 years prior.  [[Jacques Rogge]], the IOC President, said it would be "inappropriate".  Speaking of the decision, Ladany commented:  "I do not understand. I do not understand, and I do not accept it."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Later career===
Ladany returned to competition two months later, against the wishes of the Israeli track and field authorities.  The specialist in [[ultra long distance walking]] competed in the 1972 World Championships, in [[Lugano]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="haaretz3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sagi|first=Yehoshua|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/fame-was-a-long-walk-away-and-he-made-it-1.98773|title=Fame was a long walk away, and he made it|publisher=Haaretz|date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[gold medal]] in the [[100-km walk]], in a time of 9:31:00.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9NElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lfMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=778,147943&amp;dq=shaul+ladany&amp;hl=en|author=Al Levine|title=World will Forget Munich – not Everyone is Jewish|publisher=The Miami News|date=March 1, 1973|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1973 Maccabiah Games]], he won the [[20 kilometres race walk|20-km]] and 50-km walks.&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google7"/&gt; In 1976, Ladany set the U.S. record in the 75-kilometer walk for the second year in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qiBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cu0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3602,4924554&amp;dq=shaul+ladany&amp;hl=en|title=Ladany Walks to U.S. Mark|publisher=Spokesman-Review|date=April 12, 1976|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became the first person ever to win both the American Open and American Masters (40 years and over) 75-kilometer walking championships.&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt; He repeated the feat in 1977 and 1981 (by which time the event had become a 100-km race).&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt;

He won the Israeli national walking championship 28 times from 1963–88.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt; He won the U.S. national walking championship six times (from 1973–81; including the 75-km championships in 1974–77, and the 100-km title in 1974), won the Belgian national walking championship twice (1971 and 1972), won the national walking championship in Switzerland (1972), and won the South Africa national walking championship (1975).&lt;ref name="jewsinsports1"/&gt; His personal best in the 50-kilometer walk is 4:17:06 (1972).&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt; He has continued to compete with considerable success at the masters level into his seventies.&lt;ref name="sports-reference1"/&gt;  In 2006, he became the first 70-year-old to walk 100 miles in under 24 hours, setting a world record in Ohio of 21 hours, 45 minutes, 34 seconds.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nancy Harrison|url=http://www.sandiegojewishworld.com/2007-sdjw/2007-06-SDJW/2007-06-09/2007-06-09.htm|title=Olympics movement honors Israeli race walker|publisher=San Diego Jewish World|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the age of 75, he was still competing in 35 events a year, walking a minimum of 15 kilometers a day, and participating in a four-day, 300-kilometer walk from Paris to [[Tubize]], near Brussels.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thejewishweek1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Renee Ghert-Zand|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/healthcare/healthiness_long_distance_walker|title=The Healthiness Of A Long-Distance Walker|publisher=The Jewish Week|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On every birthday he walks his age in kilometers, so on his birthday in 2012 he went on a 76-km walk in Israel's southern [[Negev desert]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He estimates he has walked 6,000–7,000 miles a year, for a lifetime total of over half a million miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/la-longue-marche-de-shaul-ladany-rescape-de-l-attentat-des-jo-de-munich-en-1972-07-06-2012-1470659_24.php|title=La longue marche de Shaul Ladany, rescapé de l'attentat des JO de Munich en 1972|language=French|publisher=Le Point|date=July 6, 1972|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deck Shuffleboard.JPG|thumb|275px|A shuffleboard game being prepared on a ship's deck]]

'''Shuffleboard''', more precisely '''deck shuffleboard''', and also known  as '''floor shuffleboard''', is a [[game]] in which players use cues to push weighted discs, sending them gliding down a narrow court, with the purpose of having them come to rest within a marked scoring area. As a more generic term, it refers to the family of shuffleboard-variant games as a whole.

== History ==
The full history of shuffleboard is not known. Though there is some knowledge of its development, its actual origins, the place and date where it was first played, remain a mystery. Inevitably, this uncertainty gives rise to some debate, even disagreement, about which country can claim to have invented it. However there is no dispute concerning its age as a form of popular amusement, and in [[Europe]] has a history that goes back over 500 years.

The game was played and gambled over by King [[Henry VIII of England]], who prohibited [[commoner]]s from playing; evidently he did not always win, as the record of royal expenses for 1532 show a payment from the [[Privy Purse]] of [[Pound sterling|GB£]]9, 'Paied to my lord Wylliam for that he wanne of the kinges grace at shovillaborde' (today's spelling:  'Paid to Lord William, for he won, by the king's grace, at shovelboard').

In its goals, form and equipment, shuffleboard shares various features with (and perhaps influences by or upon) many other games, including [[air hockey]], [[bowls]], [[bocce]], [[curling]], [[croquet]], [[carrom]] and [[billiards]].  Historically, the ancient shovelboard, about which little is known, appears to have diverged into modern shuffleboard and [[Table shuffleboard#Sjoelen|sjoelen]], and with the former leading to the development of both [[table shuffleboard]] and [[shove ha'penny]].&lt;ref name="TradeGames2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Shove-HaPenny.htm |title=Shove Ha'penny: History and Useful Information|work=The Online Guide to Traditional Games|accessdate=2007-09-22|first=James|last=Masters|year=1997|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, due to its popularity on [[cruise ship]]s and in [[retirement home]]s because of its low physical fitness requirements, the deck game is often associated with the elderly, though it is increasingly popular among younger generations. Its [[Table shuffleboard|miniaturized tabletop variant]] is very popular in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[Public house|pubs]].

== Game play ==
In ''deck'' or ''floor'' shuffleboard, players use a ''cue'' (''cue-stick''), to push their colored ''disks'', down a ''court'' (a flat floor of concrete, wood or other hard material, marked with lines denoting scoring zones), attempting to place their disks within a marked scoring area at the far end of the court. The disks themselves are of two contrasting colors (usually yellow and black), each color belonging to a player or team. The scoring diagram is divided by lines, into six scoring zones, with the following values: 10, 8, 8, 7, 7, 10-off. (See ''Court Description'' below for details.) After  8 disks (four per team, taking alternating shots) have been played from one end of the court (a ''frame''), the final score values of disks for each player (or team) in the scoring zones is assessed: If a disk is completely within a scoring zone without touching (overlapping) any part of the border-line of the zone, it is ''good'' and that zone value is added to the correct player's score for the frame, and then to the player's total points. Both players good disks are added to their respective scores (As opposed to being subtracted to give only one player a net score for a frame.) Players (or teams of two players, one at each end) take turns going first during a game, so that the advantageous last shot of a frame (the ''hammer'') also alternates between players. The winner of the game may be the first to reach any total decided upon, or may be the higher score after playing a certain number of frames (e.g. 8, 12 or 16).  There is also the 'first to 75-points' game. Ties are broken by playing extra frames (two for singles, four for doubles).
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-shuffleboard.org/index.php/shuffleboard-playing-rules International Tournament Rules&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy ===
In shuffleboard, one tries to score, prevent the opponent from scoring, or both. 
The basic strategy involves both offense and defense. If it is your turn to shoot first, you are automatically on the defensive, because your opponent has the last shot of the frame. If you simply put your first shot into the scoring area, your opponent will knock it off, and if you then score with your second shot, the same will happen, and so on until you have used your last shot, and your opponent will knock that off and probably score. To combat this you can use the strategy of blocking and hiding – That is your first shot will be a guard disk shot to a location so that it blocks your opponent from that part of the scoring area that you can still place a good disk. Your second shot will be the one to play into that hiding place you created with your first shot, so your opponent cannot hit you out directly.

=== Court description ===
[[File:Shuffleboard.svg|thumb|center|700px|Top view of a shuffleboard]]

[[File:Shuffleboard scoring area.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A close up of the scoring triangle]]

Dimensions of a floor shuffleboard court can vary to suit available space, but an official shuffleboard court is 6 feet wide by 39 feet in length plus a 6-foot shooting area at each end.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Typically a scoring zone is painted at each end of the court to reduce set-up time between games. Each scoring zone comprises an [[isosceles triangle]] 6 feet × 9 feet with the short edge away from the shooter. Behind the scoring zone is the ''10-off'' zone, an area 1½ feet deep. The court surface is usually a uniform dark green; lines are 1 inch wide except for the mid-shooting area. One-inch white lines form the scoring triangle and FURTHER divide the triangle into the separate scoring zones. Line width is not considered in court dimensions given here. The court is the same from each end. (A) 6 feet for Player Shooting Area; A line called the Baseline crosses the entire court and extends to the adjacent court on each side if any; (B) 10-off area – 1 1/2 feet. The sides of the 10-Off area are defined by two lines running at the same angle as the Scoring Triangle; The ''Back-7 Line'' crosses the entire court. (C) A ''center-line'' runs from the middle of the Back-7-line up the middle of the court for 6 feet. The two ''7'' score zones are located on each side of the Center-Line, for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the ''Back-8'' line, running side to side across and within the scoring triangle; (D) The two ''8'' scoring zones are located one each side of the center-line for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the ''Top-8'' line running side to side across and within the scoring triangle, and forming a ''T'' with the end of the center-line.  (E) The ''10'' scoring zone is at the peak of the overall scoring triangle, and is 3 feet in height, from the Top-8 line to the peak of the triangle. A further ''dead-line'' or ''lag-Line'' runs from side to side 12 feet from the base-line (The dead-line is therefore 3 feet from the tip of the triangle). There are two dead-lines, 12 feet apart. Any shot disk that does not cross or touch the furthest dead-line is then simply removed from the court (a wasted shot).

=== Equipment ===
Disks: Modern floor shuffleboard is played with 8 round, hard, durable 6 inch diameter plastic disks – New disks are about 1" in thickness, weighing 15 ounces. There should be four (4) discs of a light color, usually yellow, and four of a dark color, usually black. These eight (8) discs comprise a set. (Other colored combinations may be used, but ''black'' and ''yellow'' will be used here.) One player or team uses the yellow disks, the other player or team, the black disks.
Cue-Sticks: Each player uses a ''cue'' (''cue-stick'') to push their disks down the court to the opposite end. The cue length is six feet, three inches (6'3") or less, with hard plastic feet on the end (metal would damage the court surface).
Scoreboard: There are two basic types (1) – ''Resort Type'' uses two sliders that can move up and down a numbered scale, like a thermometer, with values running from zero at the bottom to 75 at the top (First to 75 points is a common shuffleboard game). Each team used their own slider to record their total score.  The advantages of the Resort-type include simplicity, durable and weather proof, needs no other items such as chalk or eraser. The disadvantage is that scoring mistakes are impossible to determine, and a frames played cannot be tracked unless a separate recording method (e.g. pen and paper) is used.(2)- Blackboard (Whiteboard) Type is ruled with four or eight horizontal lines and each teams total score is written after each frame, yellow on the left and black on the right. When all the lines have been filled with scores the top lines are erased and scores are again written from  the top. The advantage of the blackboard type is that mistakes in adding and recording the score are easier to spot, because previous scores should always be seen. As well, it is easy to keep track of frames played using small numbers written down the scoreboard. (Note that in western USA and western Canada, scoreboards (blackboards) run from side-to-side, but the principal is the same.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.com|title=American Sailing Association (ASA)|website=American Sailing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--spacing--&gt;

Courts are available for use on residential decks or on any solid flat surface, in the form of roll-out plastic mats, or  adjustable arrays of plastic tiles.  With the tile courts, the dimensions can be adapted to the space available; e.g. it is possible to play on a court {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} by {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2007}} The roll-out mats are available in two sizes, {{convert|39|x|6|ft|m}} and {{convert|27|x|4.5|ft|m}}. The smaller mats are designed to fit on a domestic patio or driveway.{{citation needed|date=September 2007}} The biscuit and tang are the same standard size, regardless which court size is used.

== International Shuffleboard Association ==

The ISA was founded March 10, 1979, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. The ISA was designed to make shuffleboard more popular in countries outside the North American continent, and to foster shuffleboard through international competitions. In 1981 in [[Muskegon, Michigan]] the first ISA Team World Championships were held, starting with teams from Canada, the USA and Japan only. [[Australia]] (1991), [[Brazil]] (1997), [[Germany]] (2006), [[Norway]] (2011) and lately [[Russia]] (2013) joined the World Championships, which take place yearly and last for one week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-shuffleboard.org/index.php/shuffleboard-isa/49-welcome-to-the-home-of-international-shuffleboard&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ISA, Declan hosts an international competition biannually.

== Table shuffleboard variants ==
{{Main|Table Shuffleboard}}

In table shuffleboard, the play area is most commonly a wooden or laminated surface covered with silicone beads (colloquially called 'shuffleboard wax') to reduce friction. In the United States, a long, narrow 22&amp;nbsp;ft table is most commonly used, though tables as short as 9&amp;nbsp;ft are known.

Players try to slide metal-and-plastic pucks, sometimes called weights or shuckles, to come to rest within zones at the other end of the board. Cues are not used, the pucks being propelled with the hands directly on the raised table. There are scoring zones at each end of the table so that direction of play can rotate after each frame, or so that teams can play both directions during one frame. More points are awarded for weights scoring closer to the far edge of the board. Players take turns sliding the pucks, trying to score points, bump opposing pucks off the board, and/or protect their own pucks from bump-offs.  The long sides of the table are bounded by gutters into which pucks can fall or be knocked (in which case they are no longer in play for the remainder of the frame). A variant known sometimes as [[bankboard]] has rubber cushions or 'banks' running the length of both sides of the table, instead of gutters, and as in [[Cue sports|billiards]], the banks can be used to gain favorable position. A common and even smaller-scale [[United Kingdom|British]] tabletop variant is [[shove ha'penny]], played with coins, while a somewhat larger wooden-puck variant called ''[[Table shuffleboard#Sjoelen|sjoelen]]'', which has much in common with the ball games [[bagatelle]] and [[skeeball]], is played principally in the [[Netherlands]].

=== Object of the game ===
The objective of the game is to slide, by hand, all four of one's Weights alternately against those of an opponent, so that they reach the highest scoring area without falling off the end of the board into the alley. Furthermore, a player's Weight(s) must be farther down the board than his opponent's Weight(s), in order to be in scoring position. This may be achieved either by knocking off the opponent's Weight(s), or by outdistancing them. Horse collar, the most common form of the game, is played to either 15 or, more typically, 21. Only the weights in front score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccluretables.com/t-Shuffleboard_Game_Rules.aspx|title=Shuffleboard Game Rules – McClure Tables|website=www.mccluretables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">'''Stickum''' is a trademark [[adhesive]] of Mueller Sports Medicine,  of [[Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin]], United States.  It is available in powder, paste, and [[aerosol spray]] forms.  According to the company website, the spray form is "excellent for bat handles and vaulting poles."  Many vendors also promote the product for use by weightlifters, and for various other athletic applications.

Stickum, along with other adhesive or "sticky" substances (such as [[glue]], [[rosin]] (tree sap), or food substances), were used for years in the [[National Football League]] to assist players in gripping the ball. The use of adhesives such as Stickum was [[Lester Hayes#Stickum controversy|banned by the league in 1981]], and the resulting action became known as the "[[List of NFL nicknames#Rules named after NFL figures|Lester Hayes rule]]" in association with the [[Oakland Raiders]] defensive back known for his widespread use of Stickum.  Despite the ban, Hall of Famer [[Jerry Rice]] freely admitted to illegally using Stickum throughout his career, leading many fans to question the integrity of his receiving records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breech |first=John |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters |title=Jerry Rice admitted to cheating just days before calling Pats cheaters |website=CBSSports.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html |title=Who's cheating now?

In 2016 the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) also saw its players use Stickum; [[Houston Rockets]] center [[Dwight Howard]] was caught using Stickum in a game against the [[Atlanta Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15037229/no-fine-nba-issues-warning-rockets-dwight-howard-admitted-stickum-use|title=Howard gets warning but no ban for Stickum use|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard later admitted that he had been using the substance for years, but neither he nor the Rockets were reprimanded by the league, though they received a warning by the NBA to avoid using the substance again.

[[File:Preparing the switch hit.jpg|thumb|300px| Kevin Pietersen about to play a switch hit during a Test against South Africa in 2008. Note how despite being a right-handed batsmen, he has assumed the grip and stance of a left-handed batsman.]]

A '''switch hit''' is a modern [[cricket]] shot. A switch hit involves effectively changed from a right-hander to a left-hander just before the ball was delivered by the bowler for the purpose of executing the shot. It is a variation of the [[Batting (cricket)|reverse sweep]], in which the stance is changed during the bowler's delivery action, and has been compared to [[Switch hitter|switch-hitting]] in baseball.

The shot is usually attributed to [[Kevin Pietersen]].&lt;ref name="BBCSport"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/18299652 |title=Switch-hit given OK by International Cricket Council |accessdate=2012-06-03|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen played the shot for the first time off [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] in a test match against Sri Lanka in May 2006, and used it again on 15 June 2008 in a [[one-day international]] against New Zealand. Despite the shot becoming known due to Pietersen's successful execution of it, it is believed that Jonty Rhodes actually executed this shot first: he hit a switch-hit six off Darren Lehmann in a one day international between Australia and South Africa on March 27, 2002.  Australia's [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] is a notable user of this shot and was endorsed to use a double-faced bat in Twenty20 cricket.

The shot was innovated by Pietersen using which he hit 2 sixes in the [[Fielding (cricket)|cover]] region. The shot is executed by changing stance from a right-handed to a left-handed batsman or vice versa during the bowler's run-up and hitting it in the cover (midwicket to a left-hander) region.

The shot has generated debate in the cricket world, some heralding it as an outstanding display of skill and others arguing that if the batsman changes stance he gains an unfair advantage over the bowler, because the field is set based on the batsman's initial stance at the crease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setanta.com/en/Sport/News/Other-sports/2008/06/16/Cricket-MCC-to-investigate-KP/?facets/sport-space/great-britain-locale/cricket/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), guardians of the laws of cricket, has confirmed it will not legislate against the switch shot and cited that the shot was perfectly legal in accordance with cricketing laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.aol.co.uk/cricket/mcc-to-examine-pietersen-switch-shot/article/20080616105009990006, Mcc Examines Switch shot]&lt;/ref&gt; The MCC believes that the stroke is exciting for the game of cricket, and highlighted Law 36.3 which defines the off side of the striker's wicket as being determined by his stance at the moment the bowler starts his run-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/06/17/scfron317.xml, Kevin Pietersen switch shot approved by MCC]&lt;/ref&gt; The MCC has also acknowledged that the switch hit has implications on the interpretation of the 'on side' and 'off side' for the purposes of adjudicating on wides or [[leg before wicket]] decisions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In June 2012, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) committee declared it to be a legitimate shot.  They issued a statement saying they have decided to make no change to the current regulations.&lt;ref name="BBCSport" /&gt;

On the other hand, if defined by [[Switch hitter|baseball equivalent]], where a player change stance before even facing the ball, players that are able to bat both left handed and right handed straight up do not actually change handedness in the course of a match.

[[File:RheinEnergieStadion Köln 011.jpg|thumb|300px|Terraced at bottom and seating at top at the [[RheinEnergieStadion]] in Germany, home of 2. Bundesliga club [[1. FC Köln]]]]

A '''terrace''' or terracing in sporting  terms refers to the traditional standing area of a sports stadium, particularly in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. A terrace is a series of concrete steps which are erected for spectators to stand on.

Its significance carries particular importance in football where terraces were located in the areas behind the two goals as a cheaper alternative to sitting in the stands, which were traditionally located at the sides of the field. Naturally standing in the terraces was much cheaper than a seat, with the result that over the decades they became the most popular spectators' area for younger working class men and teenage boys to watch the game.

Due to safety concerns related to terraces, they have fallen out of favour in many places.  Terraces were banned from major football grounds in England in the early 1990s, as a result of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], and are currently not used during major tournaments, and for a long time were generally not included in new stadium designs. There is currently a growing demand for a reintroduction of terracing, based on the modern stadium designs in Germany and other European countries, dubbed "[[safe standing]]" areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportshaze.com/england/english-premier-league/should-fans-be-allowed-to-stand-at-a-football-match-2462|title=Sports Haze — Sports News – Sports Opinion – Sports Lifestyle|work=Sports Haze|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321205608/http://sportshaze.com/england/english-premier-league/should-fans-be-allowed-to-stand-at-a-football-match-2462/|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==
[[File:Hill16.jpg|right|thumb|200px|View of [[Hill 16]] in [[Croke Park]]]]
In Ireland, terraces are still a common feature in [[gaelic football]], [[hurling]], [[camogie]], [[rugby union]], soccer and other sports. Terraces in Ireland were generally not subject to the same level of violence as those in the United Kingdom, nor were they subject to crowd segregation (with the exception of, occasionally, football) or the [[Taylor Report]] as British terraces were, so terraces remained a common feature in Irish stadia. [[Hill 16]] in [[Croke Park]] is one of the most notable terraces in Ireland.

Terraces have been built or refurbished in ground improvements at many stadia in recent years, including [[Thomond Park]], Croke Park and [[Flancare Park]] (since converted to all-seater); although all new [[League of Ireland]] stands built since Flancare's redevelopment have happened to be all-seater. Also GAA stadiums have terracing including Fitzgerald Stadium and Pearse Park

== United Kingdom ==
=== History ===
In the early days of the twentieth century the terraces were simply earth banks, often built up with the rubble of construction sites. Rows of [[railroad tie|railways sleepers]] were laid on top to provide something solid for spectators to stand on.

Most stadiums in Britain at the turn of the century had [[bleachers]] for spectators, but when a wooden bleacher style terrace at [[Ibrox Park]] collapsed in the [[1902 Ibrox disaster]] killing many spectators during a [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] versus [[England national football team|England]] game there was an instant ban on framework supported terraces, which the government ordered must be replaced by solid earthwork supported terracing.

The earth and sleeper terraces would gradually make way for concrete terraces with metal crush barriers being erected at various points to prevent [[human crush|crushing]]. An excellent example of one such old style terrace can be found at [[Cathkin Park]] in Glasgow, an abandoned football stadium, which was home to [[Third Lanark]].

=== Popularity ===
The terraces were hugely popular in England, particularly from the 1920s to the 1980s, and their working class links led them to be given affectionate names by the fans who stood on them. By far the most common name was ''[[Spion Kop (stadia)|Spion Kop]]'', named after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa in 1902 between Britain and the Boers. [[Arsenal F.C.]] were the first to adopt such a name but by far the most famous was the Kop at [[Liverpool F.C.]]'s [[Anfield Road]] ground. The vast majority of clubs in England and farther afield would go on to regard their most popular end of their stadium as a Kop, even if, in most cases the end had another name, for example the Holte End at [[Aston Villa F.C.]]'s [[Villa Park]]. The most notable exception to this is [[Everton F.C.]], whose close rivalry with city neighbours Liverpool has meant that neither the club nor its fans would ever refer to the ground as having a Kop section.

The advantage of terracing over seating for clubs was obvious, as many more fans could be packed in tightly into very cramped areas, and it is no coincidence that many clubs' all-time attendance records were set in the 1930s and 40s.

=== Safety ===
[[File:Brunton Park Warwick Road End.jpg|thumb|300px|The Warwick Road End a covered Terrace at [[Brunton Park]], home of [[Carlisle United F.C.]]]]
Terraces were generally a safe, cheap and enjoyable way to watch sport, but on occasion they could be dangerous too.

In the early days the wet railway sleepers would often lead to falls, which quickly led to their replacement but much worse was to follow when thirty-three people lost their lives in 1946 when an overcrowded terrace led to a [[human crush|crush]] at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.]]'s [[Burnden Park]] ground. That such a disaster only occurred once during this era is amazing as it was common in those days to see a fainted fan being passed down the terraces over the heads of those packed in so they could be treated for their ill effects. But there were perhaps more advantages than disadvantages still. The ground fee was low and achievable for all, the singing and cheering was not rarely astonishing, especially where the huge covered ''Goal Stands'' existed. Like [[the Kop]] at [[Anfield Road]], Holte End at [[Villa Park]] and '''North Bank Stand''' at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux Ground]]

By the 1970s the lower cost of travel meant it was easier for fans to have away days, or road trips and a common practice among young visiting fans was to try to "take the terrace". Large bodies of supporters of the visiting team would infiltrate the popular terracing of the home supporters with the result that violence often erupted. This led to crowd segregation at football grounds and also played a small part in the erection of high fencing and segregated pens within most terraces in England.

These pens became a contributing factor in the [[Hillsborough disaster]], England's worst ever stadium disaster, when too many fans entered the central pens at the [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]]. 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans were crushed to death against the [[perimeter fence]] in the resultant crush.

Although claiming that terraces were not "intrinsically unsafe", the final [[Taylor Report]] into the disaster led to a recommendation that terraces be done away with at major British stadiums. Today every major British football ground is all-seater, though terracing is still found at grounds in the lower leagues. Britain's biggest remaining terraced ground is [[Brunton Park]] in Carlisle, which still has three sides of terracing.

=== Crowd disorder ===
It has been argued{{Citation needed|reason=by whom?|date=December 2013}} that terraces encourage crowd disorder. However, analysis of statistics on football related arrests and banning orders published by the UK Home Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/football-banning-orders/|title=Crime prevention|work=homeoffice.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that in both the 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons the rate of arrest per 100,000 supporters was higher at [[Football League One]] and [[Football League Two]] clubs with all-seated grounds than at those with terraces.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;50 Stand Up Sit Down – A Choice to Watch Football. Peter Caton 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-78088-177-5}}. Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; Overall arrest rates for football related offences have fallen steadily from 34 per 100,000 in 1988/89 to 9 per 100,000 in 2009/10, however the trend of reducing arrests started before stadia were required to become all-seated and has continued since.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Safe standing ===
{{Main|Safe standing}}
In 2011 the [[Scottish Premier League]] announced that their clubs would be given permission to introduce [[safe standing]] areas at their grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16248937.stm|title=Scottish Premier League gives green light for standing areas|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Aston Villa F.C|Aston Villa]] announced they would be looking to install safe standing areas in [[Villa Park]] in time for the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2088004/Aston-Villa-want-safe-standing-area-Villa-Park.html|title=Aston Villa want safe-standing area at Villa Park – Daily Mail Online|date=17 January 2012|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Derby County became the first club from the Championship to support the introduction of safe standing areas, although the only terraced standing areas in the Championship and/or Barclays Premiership at that time could be found at London Road, home to Peterborough United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safestandingroadshow.co.uk/news/derbycountyandnigelcloughbacksafestanding|title=Derby County &amp; Nigel Clough pro safe standing – Safe Standing Roadshow.co.uk|work=safestandingroadshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterborough United became the second Championship club to back the safe standing campaign through their CEO Bob Symns. Symns also signed the safe standing petition.&lt;ref name="safestandingroadshow.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safestandingroadshow.co.uk/news/peterboroughoffertotrialsafestanding|title=Peterborough CEO offers to trial safe standing – Safe Standing Roadshow.co.uk|work=safestandingroadshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the club's mascot – Peter Burrow – took part in a video campaign promoting safe standing, with the video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safestandingroadshow.co.uk/news/thesilentmoviepeterburrowsdilemma|title=The Silent Movie: Peter Burrow's Dilemma – Safe Standing Roadshow.co.uk|work=safestandingroadshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; being shot at the [[AWD-Arena]], home to [[Hannover 96]] in Germany&lt;ref name="safestandingroadshow.co.uk" /&gt;

== United States ==
Terracing was introduced to [[American football]] with the inclusion of party decks with the ability to hold 35,000 people at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in the [[Dallas]] suburb of [[Arlington, Texas]]. Capacity for [[Dallas Cowboys]] games and other American football events is 80,000 seated, expandable to 111,000 with standing areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/080109dnspocowside.1f521fe.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that these decks are flat, rather than steeply pitched, and are more analogous to [[standing-room only]] ticketing where obstruction is expected. The key difference is that unlike at European grounds, party decks are not considered or marketed as areas from which all spectators are afforded a view of the match at all times.

Many seats in [[FedExField]], home of the [[Washington Redskins]], have been removed in favor of terraced party decks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8280cb76/article/redskins-stadium-to-feature-standingroom-only-party-deck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redskins.com/media-gallery/photo-gallery/Upper-Level-Standing-Decks/7c433da1-6b95-4b73-9ddf-2d2bf2314ce0#adc6dce0-d4a7-4558-8195-b1f87c7d325a&lt;/ref&gt; These terraced, standing room only sections are similar to [[safe standing]] sections in European stadiums, though they are not marketed as such.

American [[John Carpenter (athlete)|John Carpenter]] was disqualified, and teammates [[John Taylor (athlete)|John Baxter Taylor]] and [[William Robbins (athlete)|William Robbins]] refused to race in protest.]]
A '''walkover''', also '''W.O.''' or '''w/o''' (originally two words: "walk over") is the awarding of a victory to a contestant because there are no other contestants or the other contestants have been disqualified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PAP team points out error in RP form, averting possible walkover in West Coast GRC|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pap-team-points-out-error-in-rp-form-averting-possible-walkover-in-west-coast-grc|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=1 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have [[forfeit (sport)|forfeited]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The term can apply in [[sport]] but also to [[election]]s, when it is also referred to as winning "by default". The word is used more generally by extension, particularly in politics, for a contest in which the winner is not the only participant but has little or no competition.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.: walkover&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow and extended meanings of "walkover" as a single word are both found from 1829.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

==Sports==
{{see also|Forfeit (sport)}}
The word originates from [[Horseracing in Great Britain|horseracing]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where an entrant in a one-horse race run under [[Jockey Club]] rules has at least to "walk over" the course before being awarded victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |at=walk 16e, walk over}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outcome was quite common at a time when there was no guaranteed prize money for horses finishing second or third, so there was no incentive to run a horse in a race it could not win. The eighteenth century champion racehorse [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] was so dominant over his contemporaries that he was allowed to walk over on nine occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Bios/Eclipse.htm|title=Eclipse|website=www.bloodlines.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1828 [[Epsom Derby]] winner [[Cadland]] walked over on at least six occasions.

The term is also used in [[tennis]], in reference to a player's unopposed victory as a result of the opponent's failing to start the match for any reason, such as injury.

The only Olympic Games walkover for a gold medal was at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]]: [[Wyndham Halswelle]] won a rerun of [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metres|the 400 m race]] as the two other athletes refused to take part in the rerun. The only time it has happened at the [[FIFA World Cup]] was in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 edition]], when [[Austria national football team|Austria]] was [[Anschluss|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] before the former was scheduled to play [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. After the [[England national football team|England team]] declined to take Austria's entry, FIFA gave Sweden a walkover.

==Use in elections==
A walkover is usually the sign of a very strong [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] or [[unanimity|unanimous support]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teh|first1=Shi Ning|title=Chan Chun Sing: The practical politician|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/chan-chun-sing-practical-politician|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=AsiaOne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can, however, be interpreted by critics of the faction the walkover is awarded to as a suspicious sign of [[electoral fraud]] or [[gerrymandering]] to prevent other candidates from participating. The circumstances of such an interpretation are usually controversial. Walkovers can thus often be a sign of an [[illiberal democracy]].

In civic organisations and civic societies, where personal charisma and personal politics often dominate, while parties or factions are often interested in a seat, they may not contest a seat that is being held by a long-standing or very popular individual, for fear of being seen as "rocking the boat". In elections for these societies, there is often "pre-election politics" where candidates attempt to figure out who is running for which positions; in this cat and mouse game, elected positions are thus often effectively decided by internal politics before a single vote is cast.

Many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] in history, including the [[history of United States|United States]], have had uncontested elections because support for one candidate was so strong. In the [[United States presidential election, 1788–89|United States presidential elections of 1789]] and [[United States presidential election, 1792|1792]], [[George Washington]] ran uncontested for [[President of the United States|President]], although in the latter election the ballot for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] was contested by both [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], [[James Monroe]] also ran unopposed, though
New Hampshire elector [[William Plumer]] cast a vote for [[John Quincy Adams]] as a symbolic measure.

Election walkovers are called [[acclamation]] in [[Canada]].

Other multi-party systems that have held uncontested presidential elections include [[Germany]], [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Justin|title=Melvin Yong, Joan Pereira join PAP’s Tanjong Pagar GRC team|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/melvin-yong-joan-pereira/2052302.html|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=Channel NewsAsia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Algeria]], [[Iceland]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

Running without opponents is not always a guarantee of winning. Many elections require that the winner has not only the most votes of all candidates but a defined fraction of all votes cast, or of the electorate. In this case electors may be able to cast a [[blank vote]] or [[none of the above]] vote, [[spoiled vote|spoil their papers]], or [[Abstention|abstain from voting]], preventing the one candidate from winning and forcing a new election. In the [[Philippines]], the sole candidate in an uncontested election must have at least one vote in order to win the seat; this is also true in general elections in the United States, and there are cases in local government races where the sole candidate on the ballot finished with zero votes (as almost all U.S. government seats require candidates to reside in the municipality they seek to represent, this means the candidate themselves must, usually out of forgetfulness or lack of time on election day, fail to vote for themselves) and thus lose an uncontested election. In such cases, the other members of the body usually appoint someone to the vacant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/09/10/man-loses-election-when-nobody-votes-including-himself/72008048/|title=Man loses election when nobody votes, including himself|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is not true in primary elections.) In theory, if a candidate is unopposed on the ballot but lacks support of their constituency, a [[draft campaign]] could outvote the unopposed candidate with any [[write-in candidate]], regardless of whether that write-in name is actively seeking the seat.

”Winning by default” can also happen when there are less candidates than what is required. For example, if a group requires 7 people, and only 4 people go for the role, the candidates may be elected by default.

==Use in poker==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In [[poker]] games that use [[blind bet|blinds]], a hand is considered a walkover (usually shortened to ''walk'') when no other players call or raise the big blind, resulting in the player who posted the big blind winning the hand by default. Walks are most often seen in tournament play. [[Cash games]] often allow the players to "split the blinds" (i.e. take back their blind bets in case there are no callers or raisers by the time the action gets to the small blind), but this is usually not permitted in tournaments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5868">'''William Anthony Gamson''' (born January 27, 1934) is a professor of [[Sociology]] at [[Boston College]], where he is also the co-director of [[Boston College Media Research and Action Project|the Media Research and Action Project (MRAP)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.bc.edu/~gamson/Homepage(Frames).html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185042/https://www2.bc.edu/~gamson/Homepage%28Frames%29.html |archivedate=2011-06-29 |title=William Gamson's Homepage |accessdate=2012-12-13 |publisher=[[Boston College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of numerous books and articles on [[political discourse]], the [[mass-media]] and [[social movements]] from as early as the 1960s. His works include ''The Strategy of Social Protest'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Strategy of Social Protest'' {{ISBN|0-534-12078-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''WHAT'S NEWS'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''WHAT'S NEWS'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-02-911110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Talking Politics'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;''Talking Politics'' (2002) {{ISBN|0-521-43679-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous editions of ''[[Simulated Society|SimSoc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[SimSoc]]'' 5th edition (2000) {{ISBN|0-684-87140-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamson, who received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1959, was the 85th [[List of American Sociological Association presidents|president]] of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/about/presidents/William_Gamson.cfm "Presidents: William A. Gamson"]. [[American Sociological Association]]. Retrieved 2012-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1978|1978 recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516060355/http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |archivedate=2008-05-16 |title=1978 Foundation Program Areas |publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, he won the [[AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.aaas.org/awards.php?a_id=24 History &amp; Archives:  AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamson was instrumental in the creation of [[fantasy baseball]] and [[fantasy sports]]. He created one of the first fantasy baseball leagues in Boston in 1960, the "Baseball Seminar," where colleagues would form rosters that earned points on the players' final standings in batting average, [[Run batted in|RBI]], [[Earned run average|ERA]] and wins.&lt;ref name="The Numbers Game p. 175"&gt;[[Alan Schwarz]]: ''The Numbers Game : Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics'' [[Thomas Dunne Books]] p. 175, {{ISBN|0-312-32222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamson later brought the idea with him to the [[University of Michigan]] where some professors played the game. One professor playing the game was Bob Sklar, who taught an American Studies seminar which included [[Daniel Okrent]], who learned of the game his professor played. Okrent would later write a book that was the key catalyst for the modern [[fantasy sports]] industry.&lt;ref name="The Numbers Game p. 175"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Gamson's Law ==
''Gamson's Law of Proportionality'' or simply ''Gamson's Law'' was suggested by Eric C. Browne and Mark N. Franklin in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{JSTOR|1958776}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that  there is proportionality between the numerical representation of each political force in a government and their number of seats in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Party Size and Portfolio Payoffs.

[[File:Marn grook illustration 1857.jpg|thumb|300px|Australian Aboriginal domestic scene depicting traditional recreation, including one child kicking the "ball", with the object and caption saying to "never let the ball hit the ground". (From [[William Blandowski]]'s ''Australien in 142 Photographischen Abbildungen'', 1857. (Haddon Library, Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge))]]
'''Woggabaliri''' is a traditional [[Indigenous Australian]] "co-operative kicking volley game" similar to the games of [[keepie uppie]] and [[footbag]].&lt;ref name=Maynard&gt;{{Citation | author1=Maynard, John | title=The Aboriginal soccer tribe : A history of aboriginal involvement with the world game | publication-date=2011 | publisher=Magabala Books | isbn=978-1-921248-39-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aborigines in areas of and near [[New South Wales]] played a ball game called Woggabaliri. The ball was usually made of [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] fur, and was played in a group of four to six players in circle. It was a co-operative kicking game to see for how long the ball can be kept in the air before it touches the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sportandrecreation.nsw.gov.au/node/6549|title=Woggabaliri|last=|first=|date=|website=NSW Government - Office of Sport|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'Woggabaliri' was documented prior to 1904 as the [[Ngunnawal people|Ngunnawal word]] for "play".&lt;ref name=" Mathews "&gt;{{cite web | last = [[R. H. Mathews]] | first = | year = 1904 | title = The Wiradyuri and Other Languages of New South Wales | work = Project Gutenberg | url =  https://archive.org/stream/thewiradyuriando18978gut/18978.txt | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Played by the [[Wiradjuri]] and surrounding peoples before European arrival,&lt;ref name="Hilferti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book | last = Edwards | first = Ken | year = 1999 | title = Choopadoo: games from the dreamtime | publisher = [[Queensland University of Technology|QUT Publications]] | location =  | isbn = 1-86435-448-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Woggabaliri is a non-competitive game played with a ball made of [[Typha domingensis|Bulrush roots]] wrapped in [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] fur where the objective of it is to keep the ball in the air using [[association football]] type skills of teamwork and ball control.&lt;ref name="Maynard"/&gt; Author Ken Edwards notes that a similar game with a ball made of grass covered in [[beeswax]] was also played by the [[Jingili, Northern Territory|Jingili people]] of the [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;  

Woggabaliri is recognised by the [[Australian Sports Commission]] (ASC) as one of the oldest Indigenous ball games and is the earliest depicted, believed by the ASC to be the subject of an engraving "never let the ball hit the ground" based on [[William Blandowski]]'s observations in 1857 of camp life near [[Merbein, Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Hilferti"&gt;Tim Hilferti, The Australian Game [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] Pg 79 24 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The image is inscribed:&lt;blockquote&gt;A group of children is playing with a ball. The ball is made out of typha roots (roots of the bulrush). It is not thrown or hit with a bat, but is kicked up in the air with a foot. The aim of the game – never let the ball touch the ground.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Football Federation Australia]] referenced Woggabaliri in its [[Australian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid]] citing its similarity to [[Association football|football (soccer)]] as part of Australia's national heritage.&lt;ref name="Hilferti"/&gt;

==Modern play==
In Australia the [[Laureus Sport for Good Foundation]] promotes Woggabaliri as one of several Indigenous games available as an addition to traditional school sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/sports-legends-visit-city/305486.aspx?storypage=0|title=Sports legends visit city|first=Stan|last=Gorton|newspaper=[[Port Lincoln]] Times|date=3 January 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302145134/http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/sports-legends-visit-city/305486.aspx?storypage=0|archivedate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New South Wales Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation]] promotes Woggabaliri in [[New South Wales]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthykids.nsw.gov.au/printversion/2103.html|title=Getting active: Coaching|work=Healthy Kids website|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]]|accessdate=24 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709073426/http://www.healthykids.nsw.gov.au/printversion/2103.html|archivedate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bennett | first = Isabelle | year = 2007 | title = Traditional Indigenous Games.

===Basic rules===
The game is played by groups of four to six players standing in a circle 2 metres apart and uses either an [[association football]] or a [[Volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] ball. Using feet and knees only,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Foster |first1=Craig |title=Indigenous Australians put their foot down to fully embrace the world game |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/indigenous-australians-put-their-foot-down-to-fully-embrace-the-world-game-20111022-1mdjf.html |accessdate=6 November 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in no set order but without consecutive touches, the players attempt to keep the ball from touching the ground. The group that has the most touches in a set time wins.

===Team rules===
Two teams of four play on a [[volleyball]] court sized pitch with football (soccer) goals at each end. A game consists of two halves lasting 10 minutes each. Players may use feet, knees, thighs, chest and head to keep the ball aloft with the team losing possession if the ball touches the ground, is intercepted or an infringement occurs. Tackling is not permitted, and goals can be scored from any part of the pitch.&lt;ref name="Government"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Traditional"/&gt;
