'''1814 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Bandy]]==
'''Events'''
* The first recorded games of bandy take place in the [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] during the great frost of 1813–14, but it is probable that the game has been played there since the previous century.  A feature of the Fens is that large expanses of ice form on flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters and skating is a tradition.  Bury Fen bandy club from Bluntisham-cum-Earith, near [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]], is the most successful team, remaining unbeaten until 1890–91.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Tom Cribb]] retains his English championship but no fights involving him are recorded in 1814, although he does stage an exhibition of sparring for the [[Tsar]] of [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Cribb] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gVUt4ZMo?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}.  Retrieved on 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The site of [[Lord's Middle Ground]] is requisitioned by Parliament for the building of the [[Regent's Canal]].  [[Thomas Lord]] contacts the Eyre family, erstwhile owners of the ground, and persuades them to lease to him another parcel of land in [[St John's Wood]], about half a mile further north at a place called North Bank.  This site has previously been a duckpond.  In the winter of 1813-14, Lord again has his turf literally dug up and removed.  He builds a high perimeter fence, a tavern and a pavilion at what is now [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] (Lord's).  
* On 22 June 1814, [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) plays the first match at Lord's against Hertfordshire, then as now a minor county.  
* The first match of importance at Lord's is played 13–15 July 1814 when MCC takes on a team called St John's Wood that includes a number of [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] players including [[Billy Beldham]], [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] and [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]].
* [[Jem Broadbridge]] makes his debut in [[first-class cricket]].
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] 126 (HS 59*)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Howard (English cricketer)|Thomas Howard]] and [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] 11 apiece

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* Inaugural running of the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]

'''1869 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – [[Princeton Tigers]]
'''Events'''
* 6 November — the first American [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|intercollegiate football game]] is played, between [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton Tigers]] and [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]], although the rules are closer to modern [[Association football]] (soccer). Rutgers wins by 6 "runs" to 4.
* A second game is played a week later at Princeton who win this 8–0.

==[[Association football]]==
'''England'''
* It is about this time that tactics first become evident in football with the designation of positions to appropriate players.  Fullbacks are recognised as distinct from forwards and halfbacks begin to emerge in a sort of "midfield role".  Forwards, however, still play in a pack to support the man in possession.  Dribbling is the key skill but there remains no sign of a passing game to use the full width of the field.  Scottish club [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] is the first team to use a passing game a few years later.
'''Scotland'''
* Formation of [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], the oldest professional club in Scotland and the second oldest club in the Scottish League after [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]]

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] champion – [[Brooklyn Atlantics]]
'''Events'''
* The [[National Association of Base Ball Players|NABBP]] permits professional clubs at its December 1868 meeting. Openly there are [[1869 in baseball#Professional matches|twelve pro teams]] in the field.
* The original [[Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA)|Cincinnati Red Stockings]] sign baseball's first all-professional team, ten men including player–manager [[Harry Wright]] on salary for eight months.
* Cincinnati tours from Boston to San Francisco and completes the season without defeat in at least 57 games. The entourage includes a local newspaper reporter. Continental tours do not fit the established method of determining a champion, which has limited credibility.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 15 June — [[Mike McCoole]] defeats British challenger [[Tom Allen (boxer)|Tom Allen]] on a ninth round disqualification near St. Louis, Missouri.  McCoole continues to claim the disputed American Championship but his main rival [[Jimmy Elliott]] is inactive this year.&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/elliott.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Jimmy Elliott].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mccoole.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Mike McCoole].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Future champion Allen is the most active fighter in 1869.  Besides losing to McCoole, he defeats [[Bill Davis (boxer)|Bill Davis]] in the 43rd round; and has two fights against [[Charley Gallagher]], losing the first in the second round and drawing the rematch.  Meanwhile, the last English Champion [[Jem Mace]] is touring America and giving sparring exhibitions only.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mace-j.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Jem Mace].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The demise of the original [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club]], which had played first-class cricket since 1819.  A team called Cambridgeshire will be formed to play in two specially arranged matches, one in 1869 v. [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and one in 1871 v. [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. After that, Cambridgeshire will cease to be a first-class team.
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[W. G. Grace]] 1,320 @ 57.39 (HS 180)
* Most wickets – [[James Southerton]] 136 @ 15.36 (BB 8–68)

==[[Golf]]==
'''Major tournaments'''
* [[1869 Open Championship|British Open]] – [[Tom Morris, Jr.|Tom Morris junior]]

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1869 Grand National|Grand National]] – The Colonel (first of two consecutive wins)
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Scottish Queen 
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Pretender (horse)|Pretender]]
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Pretender (horse)|Pretender]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – Brigantine 
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – Pero Gomez
'''Australia''' 
* [[Melbourne Cup]] – Warrior
'''Canada'''
* [[Queen's Plate]] – Bay Jack
'''Ireland'''
* [[Irish Derby Stakes]] – The Scout
'''USA'''
* [[Belmont Stakes]] – [[Fenian (horse)|Fenian]]

==[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]==
'''The Boat Race'''
* 17 March — [[Oxford University Boat Club|Oxford]] wins the 26th [[The Boat Race 1869|Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]]

==[[Rugby football]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Sydney University|Sydney University Football Club]] forms the first football club in Australia, playing Rugby rules.
* Foundation of [[Preston Grasshoppers]]

'''Ballistic training''', also called '''power training''', is a form of training which involves throwing weights, and jumping with weights, in order to increase explosive power. The intention in ballistic exercises is to maximise the acceleration phase of an object's movement and minimise the deceleration phase. For instance, throwing a [[medicine ball]] maximises the acceleration of the ball; this can be contrasted with a standard weight training exercise where there would be a pronounced deceleration phase at the end of the repetition i.e. at the end of a bench press exercise the barbell is decelerated and brought to a halt. Similarly, an athlete jumping whilst holding a [[trap bar]] maximises the acceleration of the weight through the process of holding it whilst they jump; where as they would decelerate it at the end of a standard trap bar [[deadlift]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

Ballistic training was first used among [[Sport of athletics|elite athletes]] who were looking for a method to develop explosiveness.   The word ballistic comes from the Greek word βάλλειν (''ballein''), which means “to throw.”  In this type of training the athlete accelerates and releases the weight into "[[free space]]."  Common ballistic training exercises are bench throws, jump squats, cleans, snatches, and [[push press|push presses]].    

Ballistic training forces the athlete's body to recruit and trigger [[fast twitch muscle|fast twitch]] [[muscle fiber]]s.  This is important because these muscle fibers have the greatest potential for growth and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmaunderground.info/Pages/XFWorkout.aspx|title=XTREME CAGE FIGHTER WORKOUTS|website=MMA UNDERGROUND INC|publisher=MMA UNDERGROUND INC|access-date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ballistic training requires the muscles to adapt to contracting very quickly and forcefully.  This training requires the [[central nervous system]] to coordinate and produce the greatest amount of force in the shortest time possible.

In traditional weight training the athlete accelerates the weight on the concentric portion over the first third of the lift. During the other two-thirds of the lift, the weight is being slowed—decelerated—and then stopped. With ballistic training, the weight is accelerated through the whole range of motion and only starts to decelerate after the athlete has released the bar. The [[National Strength and Conditioning Association]]'s ''Basic Guidelines for the Resistance Training of Athletes'' states that "performing speed repetitions as fast as possible with light weight (e.g., 30-45% of [[1-RM]]) in exercises in which the bar is held on to and must be decelerated at the end of the joint’s range of motion (e.g., bench press) to protect the joint does not produce power or speed training but teaches the body how to decelerate, or slow down. If the load can be released into the air (i.e., the bar be let go at the end of the range of motion) the negative effects are eliminated."

Additional research has shown that as much as 75% of a movement can be devoted to slowing the bar down. Elliot, ''et al.'' (1989) reported that during 1-RM bench presses, the bar decelerates for the final 24% of the range of motion. At 81% of 1-RM, the bar decelerates for the final 52% of the range of motion. Research has shown that for best results it is important to load the bar with the amount of weight that allows for positive acceleration to be maintained through the full range of motion for the lift. An effective ballistic lift develops speed throughout the entire range of motion of the lift until the moment of release.

==Criteria==
1. '''Muscle recruitment principles'''. Ballistic lifts force the muscles to produce the greatest amount of force in the shortest amount of time. In accordance with [[Henneman's size principle]] muscle fibers are recruited from a low to a high threshold as force requirements increase.

2. '''Speed of the movement'''.  To ensure full muscle fiber recruitment the speed of the lift must be propulsive through the entire range of the movement up until release.

3. '''Intensity of the exercise'''. The duration of the lift should be measured by repetitions or time. The lift should be stopped when the bar decelerates. Research has shown the 6-8 repetitions or 20–30 seconds produces the best results.

4. '''Cardiovascular benefits'''. Ballistic exercises performed continuously for a minimum of 20 seconds followed by a 30 second rest period and then repeated until deceleration occurs has been proven to elevate the heart rate to training zone level.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010|reason=need to cite the research study that "proved" this.}} 

5. '''Co-ordination'''. Research at the University of Connecticut found that high-intensity training has profound effects on the nervous system. The exercise had to be of an intensity that elevate the heart rate to 90% of maximum rate and had to sustain that rate for at least 20 seconds.

6. '''Electronic measurement'''. There are several electronic measurement systems that measure the velocity, power, and effectiveness of a lift. The athlete should stop the lift when the speed of a lift has fallen to 90% of their previous lift. The 90% number signals that there has been a significant change in the recruitment of the fast-twitch muscle fibers. Below the 90% number the lift is no longer ballistic

7. '''Specificity of training'''. Ballistic training emphasizes throwing and jumping with a weighted object. Research has resulted in positive increases in vertical jump, throwing velocity, and running speed. There is limited transfer to a specific sport.

==Basic principles==

The most common ballistic exercises are bench throws, [[Squat (exercise)#Plyometric/bodyweight|jump squats]], cleans, and variations of the [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic lifts]]. The rate of acceleration is controlled by adjusting the amount of weight on the bar. If the weight is too light the rate of acceleration will be too fast and if the weight is too heavy the bar will decelerate before the release point.   

Research has shown that optimal power is produced when the weight being lifted is 30% to 90% of an individual’s 1-RM; an alternative to 1-RM is to use 30% to 90% of the athlete’s body weight.  Advanced lifters can use 70% to 90% of 1-RM but anything above this is not recommended.

The athlete should explode the weight up as fast as possible. The bar should leave the athlete’s hands during a press/clean or their feet will leave the ground when doing jump squats. The rate of acceleration should be manipulated to achieve the training objectives of the lifter.

Numerous studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ergo-log.com/trainingevening.html|title=Training in the evening gives you more muscles, more definition|date=February 2009|website=Ergo-Log|publisher=Flex|access-date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded that ballistic training is highly effective.  One can refer to articles by Tim Scheett, Tom Kelso, and Kevin Newell as reviews of ballistic training.

==Use in metabolic conditioning==
Ballistic exercises have traditionally been left out of metabolic conditioning workouts and training programs. This may be due to the fact that they are often ''technical lifts,'' or lifts/exercises for which technique is crucial to safe and effective completion. However, with the extensive availability of information and guidance in learning and developing proficiency in ballistic exercise, this trend is changing.

Many training programs which employ circuit training or metabolic conditioning now include ballistic exercises such as [[Kettlebell lifting|kettlebell cleans and snatches]], Olympic lifts and variations, throws and [[Plyometrics|plyometric]] variations. The benefits of their inclusion in these types of programs include higher levels of motor unit recruitment, higher caloric burn and improvements in a number of measurable athletic outputs.

During the annual [[Boston Marathon]] on April 15, 2013, two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 12 seconds and {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at 2:49&amp;nbsp;p.m., near the finish line of the race, killing three people and injuring several hundred others, including 16 who lost limbs.&lt;ref name="NYDN-5/15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-number-injured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /&gt;

Three days later, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) released images of two suspects,&lt;ref name="Clark Estes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-5" /&gt; who were later identified as [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]]-American brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]]. They killed an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department#Shooting by Boston Marathon bombing suspects|MIT policeman]], kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], during which two officers were severely injured, one of whom died a year later. Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after.

An unprecedented [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-6" /&gt; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZ2-1" /&gt; Around 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.&lt;ref&gt;"Two unnamed officials say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, did not have a gun when he was captured Friday in a Watertown, Mass. backyard. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat." The Associated Press Wednesday, April 24, 2013, 8:42 PM.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;

During questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist [[Islamism|Islamist]] beliefs and the [[Iraq War|wars in Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from an [[Inspire (magazine)|online magazine]] of the [[al-Qaeda]] affiliate in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-8" /&gt; He also said they had intended to travel to [[New York City]] to bomb [[Times Square]]. On April 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a [[Weapon of mass destruction#Criminal (civilian)|weapon of mass destruction]] and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.&lt;ref name="DOJ affidavit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Boston Marathon bomber found guilty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32225787|accessdate=April 8, 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-happened-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-update-boston-marathon-bomber-sentenced-death-2526052|title=What Happened To Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?

The [[2013 Boston Marathon|117th annual Boston Marathon]] was run on [[Patriots' Day]], April 15, 2013. At {{Nowrap |2:49&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]}} {{Nowrap|(18:49 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])}}, two bombs detonated about {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near [[Copley Square]].&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; The first exploded outside [[Marathon Sports (retailer)|Marathon Sports]] at 671–673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt; At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-13" /&gt;{{snd}}the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start{{explain|date=July 2018}} at 10:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; about 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 [[Boylston Street]].&lt;ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /&gt; The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line,&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-11" /&gt;

Windows on adjacent buildings were blown out but there was no structural damage.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt; Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-14" /&gt;

== Casualties and initial response ==
Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-30" /&gt; including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state. The explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals. At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering [[traumatic amputation]]s as a direct result of the blasts.&lt;ref name="globe-number-injured" /&gt;

Police, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to [[Boston Common]] and [[Kenmore Square]]. The nearby [[The Lenox Hotel|Lenox Hotel]] and other buildings were evacuated.&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; Police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16.&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters_McLaughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; Boston police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis]] recommended that people stay off the streets.&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt;

Dropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts,  increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs.&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-31" /&gt; There were false reports of more bombs.&lt;ref name="Clark Estes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-33" /&gt; An unrelated electrical fire at the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] in nearby [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] was initially feared to be a bomb.

[[File:2013 Boston Marathon explosions aftermath emergency services.jpg|thumb|left|Emergency services at work after the bombing]]
The airspace over Boston was restricted, and departures halted from Boston's [[Logan International Airport]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-35" /&gt; Some local transit service was halted as well.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency]] suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

The [[American Red Cross]] helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARC" /&gt; The [[Boston Police Department]] also set up a [[helpline]] for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-38" /&gt; [[Google Person Finder]] activated their disaster service under ''Boston Marathon Explosions'' to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-39" /&gt;

Due to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-40" /&gt;

== Investigation ==

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] led the investigation, assisted by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]],&lt;ref name="Hosenball" /&gt; and they named two official suspects.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-45" /&gt; It was initially believed by some that [[North Korea]] was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-blamed-for-boston-bombings-2013-4?IR=T&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-denies-any-link-boston-marathon-bombs-says-it-still-may-strike-us-1211721&lt;/ref&gt;

United States government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack. Representative [[Peter T.

The father of the two suspects claimed that the FBI had been watching his family, and that they questioned his sons in Cambridge, Massachusetts five times in relation to possible explosions on the streets of Boston.{{explain|reason=possible explosions?|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="AutoLC-47" /&gt;

[[Jeff Bauman]] was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: "Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me".&lt;ref name="Bauman evidence" /&gt; He later gave a detailed description which enabled the photo to be identified and circulated quickly.&lt;ref name="Bauman evidence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-54" /&gt;

At 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. on April 18, the FBI released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them.&lt;ref name="FBI18AprSuspectPics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI plea" /&gt; The FBI said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-175" /&gt;
As seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public [[social networking service|social networks]].&lt;ref name="FBI plea" /&gt;

A few hours after the photos were released, the Tsarnaev brothers shot Sean A. Collier of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department]] six times&lt;ref name="admits" /&gt; in an attempt to steal his gun, which they could not get out because of the holster's retention system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police believe Tsarnaev brothers killed officer for his gun|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57581048/police-believe-tsarnaev-brothers-killed-officer-for-his-gun/|publisher=CBS News|date=April 23, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the [[Stata Center]] (Building 32) on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] campus.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lowery" /&gt; He died soon after.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-58" /&gt;

Interrogation later revealed that the brothers "decided spontaneously" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name=Gorman /&gt;

The Tsarnaev brothers forced Meng to use his [[ATM card]]s to obtain $800 in cash.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPost04192013" /&gt; They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic,&lt;ref name="wsjdetails" /&gt; for which an [[all-points bulletin]] was issued.

=== Watertown shootout ===
Shortly after midnight on April 19, [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the [[Honda]] Civic and the stolen SUV. A gunfight followed between the brothers and police arriving at the scene on the 100 block of Laurel St.&lt;ref name="captured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /&gt; An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several "crude [[grenade]]s" were thrown.&lt;ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-65" /&gt;

According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an "[[arsenal]] of guns."&lt;ref name="Tucson Citizen" /&gt; Tamerlan ran out of ammunition and threw his empty pistol at Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who tackled him with help from Sergeant John MacLellan.&lt;ref name="DeWitt2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeWitt|first1=Vincent|title=Watertown Mass.

A 20-block area of Watertown was [[Cordon and search|cordoned off]] and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door, as officers scoured the area in tactical gear. Helicopters circled the area and [[SWAT]] teams in [[armored vehicles]] moved through in formation, with officers going door to door.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-76" /&gt; On the scene were the FBI, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|the Department of Homeland Security]], [[National Guard of the United States|the National Guard]], the Boston and Watertown Police departments, and the [[Massachusetts State Police]].

David Henneberry, a Watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat on the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCboat" /&gt; He then saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-84" /&gt; Authorities surrounded the boat and a police helicopter verified movement through a [[thermal imaging]] device.&lt;ref name="captured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-85" /&gt; The figure inside the boat started poking at the tarp, and police shot at the boat.&lt;ref name="AutoG4-1" /&gt;

Initial reports that the neck wound represented a suicide attempt were contradicted by his being unarmed.&lt;ref name="AutoG4-2" /&gt; The situation was chaotic according to a police source quoted by the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and the firing of weapons occurred during "the fog of war".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; A subsequent review by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provided this more specific summary: "One officer fired his weapon without appropriate authority in response to perceived movement in the boat, and surrounding officers followed suit in a round of 'contagious fire', assuming they were being fired on by the suspect. Weapons continued to be fired for several seconds until on scene supervisors ordered a ceasefire and regained control of the scene. The unauthorized shots created another dangerous crossfire situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/eopss/docs/mema/after-action-report-for-the-response-to-the-2013-boston-marathon-bombings.pdf |title=After Action Report for the Response to the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings |date=December 2014 |website=Government of Massachusetts |publisher=Executive Office of Public Safety and Security |access-date=October 10, 2017 |quote=Improvement Area 4, Lack of Weapons Discipline, page 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==

=== Interrogation ===
United States Senators [[Kelly Ayotte]], [[Saxby Chambliss]], [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[John McCain]], and Representative [[Peter T. King]] suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an [[unlawful combatant|unlawful enemy combatant]] rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining [[Assistance of Counsel Clause|legal counsel]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-92" /&gt; Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]], and would jeopardize the prosecution.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-94" /&gt; The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;

Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a [[Miranda warning]].&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-103" /&gt; Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's [[public safety exception]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-90" /&gt; This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- this article's misspelling of "Dzhokhar" is [sic] --&gt;{{cite news|title=The Right to Remain Silent: Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the Public Safety Exception, and Miranda in a post-911 World|url=http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|newspaper=Marathon Law|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613153900/http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|date=April 22, 2013|archivedate=June 13, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|title=Tsarnaev Without Tears: The Legal Way Forward|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/tsarnaev-without-tears-the-legal-way-forward/275160/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=April 20, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Should I Care That No One's Reading Dzhokhar Tsarnaev His Miranda Rights?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/04/dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_miranda_rights_the_public_safety_exception_and_terrorism.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charges and detention ===

On April 22, 2013, formal criminal charges were brought against Tsarnaev in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized.

=== Trial and sentencing ===
{{Main|Trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev}}

Jury selection began on January 5, 2015 and was completed on March 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/20/opening-statements-tsarnaev-trial-could-begin-early-march-official-says/4TZWH4KMZY2nXaHLPywTMN/story.html|title=Opening statements in Tsarnaev trial could begin in early March, official says – Metro – The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on March 4 with Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb describing the bombing and painting Dzhokhar as "a soldier in a holy war against Americans" whose motive was "reaching paradise".

Defense attorney [[Judy Clarke]] admitted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had placed the second bomb and was present at the murder of Sean Collier, the carjacking of Dun Meng, and the Watertown shootout, but she emphasized the influence that his older brother had on him, portraying him as a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings|chapter-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1681442/tsarnaev-dzkokhar-trial-transcript-3-4-2015-clarke.pdf |title=United States v.

== Motives and backgrounds of Tsarnaev brothers ==

=== Motives ===
According to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by Islamic beliefs but "were not connected to any known terrorist groups", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by [[al-Qaeda]] affiliates in Yemen.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-8" /&gt; They further alleged that "[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular] on the Fourth of July;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Plotters Said to Initially Target July 4 for Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/us/Boston-bombing-suspects-planned-july-fourth-attack.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015|first1=Eric|last1=Schmitt|first2=Mark|last2=Mazzetti|first3=Michael S.|last3=Schmidt|first4=Scott|last4=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs (capable of remote detonation) and other IEDs."

Dzhokhar said that he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., accusing the U.S. of conducting the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] against Muslims.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoG4-3" /&gt; A CBS report revealed that Dzhokhar had scrawled a note with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding; the note stated that the bombings were "retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq", and called the Boston victims "[[collateral damage]]", "in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world."&lt;ref name="cbs20130516" /&gt;&lt;ref name="consortium_mcgovern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consortiumnews.com/2013/05/17/boston-suspects-writing-on-the-wall/|title=Boston Suspect’s Writing on the Wall|work=consortiumnews.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the note were later used in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CBS Local Boston|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/03/10/jury-in-boston-bombing-trial-sees-photos-of-writing-in-boat/|accessdate=March 12, 2017|title=Boston Marathon Bombing Trial Jury Sees Photos Of Tsarnaev Boat Note|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT20130516&gt;{{cite news|title=Note by Boston Bombing Suspect Sheds Light on Motive, Officials Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/us/boston-bombing-developments.html|newspaper=The New York Times | first1=Scott|last1=Shane|first2=Ellen|last2=Barry|date=May 16, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was born in 1986 in the [[Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal" /&gt; Dzhokhar was born in 1993 in [[Kyrgyzstan]], although some reports say that his family claims that he was born in [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name="GuardianBirthplace" /&gt; The family spent time in [[Tokmok]], Kyrgyzstan, and in [[Makhachkala]], Dagestan.&lt;ref name="WashPost04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SullivanAP04192013" /&gt;
They are half [[Chechen people|Chechen]] through their father Anzor, and half [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avar]]&lt;ref name=thestarCarus /&gt; through their mother Zubeidat. They never lived in [[Chechnya]], yet the brothers identified themselves as Chechen.&lt;ref name="GuardianBirthplace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPostNoronha04192013" /&gt;

His goal was to gain a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team, saying that, "unless his native [[Chechnya]] becomes independent", he would "rather compete for the United States than for Russia".&lt;ref name="thecomment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deadspin" /&gt; He married U.S. citizen Katherine Russell on July 15, 2010 in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque&lt;ref name="Auto9P-3" /&gt; in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of Boston; she was pregnant with their daughter.&lt;ref name="mailonline" /&gt; While initially quoted in a student magazine as saying, "I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them," a later FBI interview report documents Tamerlan stating it was a misquote, and that most of his friends were American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/tamerlan-tsarnaev|title=Tamerlan Tsarnaev|work=FBI|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/us/tamerlan-tsarnaev-fbi-boston-marathon-interview/index.html|title=Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev told FBI he never picked a fight|last=CNN|first=Eric Levenson,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a history of violence, including an arrest in July 2009 for assaulting his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-107" /&gt;

The brothers were [[Muslim]]; Tamerlan's aunt stated that he had recently become a devout Muslim.&lt;ref name="HuffPost04192013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPostNoronha04192013" /&gt; Tamerlan became more devout and religious after 2009,&lt;ref name="cnn20130420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyd20130421" /&gt; and a YouTube channel in his name linked to [[Salafi movement|Salafist]]&lt;ref name="cnn20130420" /&gt; and [[Islamism|Islamist]]&lt;ref name="mailonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes20130420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-108" /&gt; videos.

At the time of the bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] with a major in [[marine biology]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-116" /&gt; He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-117" /&gt; Tamerlan's boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by Tamerlan and admired him.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-118" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-119" /&gt;

Some analysts claim that the Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons' behavior.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto9P-5" /&gt; This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government on two occasions about the family's behavior. Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-8" /&gt;

== Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions ==

=== People detained and released ===
On April 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-120" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-122" /&gt; Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack.

On the night of April 18, two men riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the Marathon attacks.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-124" /&gt; Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to [[Strip search|strip naked]] by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-126" /&gt;

Robel Phillipos (19) was a U.S. citizen of [[Ethiopian American|Ethiopian descent]] living in Cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly [[making false statements]] to police.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA.Friend"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/01/boston-marathon-bombings-tsarnaev-phillipos/2127469/|title=Bomb suspect's friend Robel Phillipos: Who is he?|last=Winter|first=Michael|date=May 1, 2013|work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school in 2011 with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-6" /&gt;
Dias Kadyrbayev (19) and Azamat Tazhayakov (20) were natives of [[Kazakhstan]] living in the U.S.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-10" /&gt; They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] at which Tsarnaev had sometimes stayed.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;

Phillipos, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov, and Tsarnaev entered the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well. After seeing photos of Tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev. The backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

==== Arrests and legal proceedings ====
Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of April 18–19. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-10" /&gt; but all three were soon released.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were re-arrested in New Bedford on April 20 and held on immigration-related violations. They appeared before a federal [[immigration judge]] on May 1 and were charged with overstaying their [[student visa]]s.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-130" /&gt; That same day, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were charged criminally with:

{{Quote |willfully conspir(ing) with each other to commit an offense against the United States… by knowingly destroying, concealing, and covering up objects belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, namely, a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the criminal investigation of the Marathon bombing.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-13" /&gt;}}

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were indicted by a [[Grand juries in the United States|federal grand jury]] on August 8, 2013 on charges of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[Obstruction of justice|obstruct justice]] for helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the bombing. Each faced up to 25 years in prison and deportation if convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 friends of Boston bombing suspect indicted|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/08/boston-marathon-bomber-friends-charged/2632191/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tazhayakov was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy on July 21, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/crime-justice/marathon-suspects-friend-guilty-of-impeding-probe|title=News|work=msn.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that "Kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that Tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in June 2015, which equated to three and a half years. Judge [[Douglas Woodlock]] gave a lighter sentence to Tazahayakov than to Kadyrbayev, who was viewed as more culpable.&lt;ref name="McMahoSargent" /&gt; Tazhayakov was released in May 2016 and subsequently deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/05/16/tsarnaev-friend-released-from-prison/1WbAvRNlmSjPdhjDTUBc9K/story.html|title=Tsarnaev friend to be released from prison|last=Valencia|first=Milton|date=May 17, 2016|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly [[making false statements]] to police.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA.Friend" /&gt; He was released on $100,000 bail and placed under house confinement with an [[ankle monitor]].&lt;ref name="Auto9P-6" /&gt; He was convicted on October 28, 2014, on two charges of lying about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room. He later acknowledged that he had been in the room while two friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/robel-phillipos-friend-of-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-is-found-guilty.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss | title=Robel Phillipos, Friend of Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect, Is Found Guilty | work=The New York Times | date=October 29, 2014 | access-date=October 28, 2014 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khairullozhon Matanov ===
A federal indictment was unsealed against Khairullozhon Matanov on May 30, 2014, charging him with "one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation." Matanov bought dinner for the two Tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing.  After the Tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the CNN and FBI websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/30/justice/boston-marathon-bombings-charges/|title=Massachusetts man charged with obstructing Boston bombings probe|first=Jason|last=Hanna|first2=Mariano|last2=Castillo|date=May 30, 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune"&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Ly|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/us/tsarnaev-friend-sentence/|title=Friend of Boston marathon bombers gets 30-month sentence|work=CNN|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan. He came to the U.S. in 2010 on a [[student visa]], and later claimed asylum. He attended [[Quincy College]] for two years before dropping out to become a taxicab driver. He was living in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] at the time of his arrest, and was a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune" /&gt;

In March 2015, Matanov pleaded guilty to all four counts.&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZalkiindMatanov"&gt;{{cite web|first=Susan|last=Zalkiind|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/26/the-fbi-is-trying-to-destroy-my-life.html|title=The FBI Is Trying to Destroy My Life|work=The Daily Beast|date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune" /&gt;

MBTA police officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. (33) was critically wounded during a firefight with the bombers just after midnight on April 19.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-28" /&gt; He lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for 45 minutes, during which time he was kept alive by [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].&lt;ref name="AutoQU-16" /&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-2" /&gt;

Law enforcement, local and national politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the bombing, generally condemning the act and expressing sympathies for the victims.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-132" /&gt;

=== Aid to victims ===

The One Fund Boston was established by [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Deval Patrick]] and Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]] to make monetary distributions to bombing victims.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trumbull" /&gt; The [[Boston Strong]] concert at the TD Garden in Boston on May 30, 2013 benefitted the One Fund, which ultimately received more than $69.8 million in donations.&lt;ref name=NECN&gt;{{cite web|title=$212K donation made to One Fund Boston|url=http://www.necn.com/09/12/13/212K-donation-made-to-One-Fund-Boston/landing.html?blockID=852181|publisher=NECN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the bombing, [[crowd funding]] websites&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[GoFundMe]], [[GiveForward]], [[FundRazr]], [[YouCaring]], and [[Fundly]]&lt;/ref&gt; received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the bombing.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-42" /&gt; The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from [[Israel]] to help Boston emergency responders, government administrators, and community people develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-7" /&gt;

=== Local ===
[[File:Remembering the victims of the Marathon Bombing-Copley Square.jpg|thumb|left|Victims of the bombing are remembered at Copley Square in Boston.]]
Numerous sporting events, concerts, and other public entertainment were postponed or cancelled in the days following the bombing.&lt;ref name="BostonSports-WashTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-133" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonSports-WashTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-134" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Nazareth host" /&gt; The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] public transit system was under heavy National Guard and police presence and it was shut down a second time April 19 during the manhunt.&lt;ref name="lowery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan and Taxis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers" /&gt;

Five years after the bombing, The Boston Globe reported all of the items from the memorials were being housed in a climate controlled environment, free of charge, by the storage company, [[Iron Mountain (company)|Iron Mountain]] in [[Northborough, Massachusetts]]. Some of the items are also being stored in Boston's city archives in [[West Roxbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=Nestor |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/14/fragments-tragedy-and-our-best-selves/gtnbkn7MiT91kYzFL1MBOL/story.html |title=Fragments of tragedy, and of our best selves |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boston University]] established a scholarship in honor of Lü Lingzi, a student who died in the bombing.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-135" /&gt; [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] did the same in honor of alumna and bombing victim Krystle Campell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umb.edu/the_university/chancellor/communications/krystle_campbell_scholarships_awarded_to_umass_students|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510170308/https://www.umb.edu/the_university/chancellor/communications/krystle_campbell_scholarships_awarded_to_umass_students|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-05-10|title=Krystle Campbell Scholarships Awarded to UMass Students – University of Massachusetts Boston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[MIT]] also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on April 29, 2015), both in memory of MIT Police officer Sean Collier.

One study conducted by the Institute for Public Service at [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, Massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing. In doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=3e680122-e67a-4fed-8ffc-a8b9572a7c67%40sessionmgr4007|title=The mental health response to the Boston bombing: A three-year review|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of Boston "applied for and received a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy".

However, there was rising [[anti-Muslim sentiment]] online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local [[Muslim]] community and leaving some afraid of going out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharyya|first1=Sriya|last2=Ashby|first2=Kimberly M.|last3=Goodman|first3=Lisa A.|title=Social Justice Beyond the Classroom|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=26 September 2014|volume=42|issue=8|pages=1136–1158|doi=10.1177/0011000014551420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National ===
President [[Barack Obama]] addressed the nation after the attack.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-137" /&gt; He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would "get to the bottom of this" and that those responsible "will feel the full weight of justice".&lt;ref name="AutoLC-138" /&gt; He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as "a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-140" /&gt;

Moments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], [[NASDAQ]], and [[New York Mercantile Exchange|NYMEX]] on the day after the bombing.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; Numerous special events were held, including marathons and other runs.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-143" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20130421/NEWS06/304210177/lansing-marathon-boston-bombing|title=Lansing Marathon runners hit the street to salute Boston|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onerunforboston.org|title=One Run For Boston 2|work=One Run for Boston|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===

The bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-144" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_wl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SI_1" /&gt;

In China, users posted condolence messages on [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] in response to the death of Lü Lingzi.&lt;ref name="newyorkFan" /&gt; Chris Buckley of ''The New York Times'' said "Ms. Lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese."&lt;ref name="Buckley" /&gt; Laurie Burkitt of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said "Ms. Lu's death resonates with many in China" due to the [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-146" /&gt;

Organizers of the [[2013 London Marathon|London Marathon]], which was held six days after the Boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organizers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for Boston Marathon victims for every person who finished the race.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-147" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-148" /&gt;

Organizers of the 2013 [[Vancouver Sun Run]], which was held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-8" /&gt;

[[Petr Gandalovic]], ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. "The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities – the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-152" /&gt;

Security was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore Marathon in December. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/singapore-hit-by-bomb-hoaxes-after-boston-attacks/ |title=Singapore Hit By Bomb Hoaxes After Boston Attacks|accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russian reaction ====
The [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] said special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-149" /&gt; According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President [[Vladimir Putin]] condemned the bombing as a "barbaric crime" and "stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities' investigation."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-150" /&gt; He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners&lt;ref name="AutoLC-151" /&gt; but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S. authorities for negligence as they warned the U.S. of the Tsarnaevs.&lt;ref name="Russia-could"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/04/26/mnenie-site.html |script-title = ru:Россия могла предотвратить теракт в Бостоне |trans-title=Russia could have prevented a terrorist attack in Boston|author=Shestakov, Yevgeny|work=Rossiyskaya Gazeta|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate= April 11, 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the United States for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} As proof a letter from the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) was shown to the members of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit.

Republican U.S. Senators [[Saxby Chambliss]] and [[Richard Burr]] reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia.&lt;ref name="BG-RUS"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/04/23/russia-contacted-fbi-multiple-times-concerns-about-alleged-boston-marathon-bomber/ND0bhUdq1Tp1mRuC8xlb8N/story.html |title = Russia contacted US government ‘multiple’ times|author1=Bender, Bryan |author2= Bierman, Noah|work=The Boston Globe|date= April 23, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT-RUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/fbi-boston-senate-hearing-263/ |title= Senate grills FBI over Boston bombings intel failures|work=RT|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family.&lt;ref name="Boston-RUSS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-mother-wiretap-jihad-519/ |title=

In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Radia|first=Kirit|title=Lawmakers Traveling to Russia to Investigate Boston Bombing|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/05/lawmakers-traveling-to-russia-to-investigate-boston-bombing/|newspaper=ABC News|date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chechen reactions ====
On April 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the [[head of the Chechen Republic]], [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], issued a statement that, inter alia, read: "The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya".&lt;ref name="AutoLC-153" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-154" /&gt; On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to have written on [[Instagram]]:&lt;ref name="AutoLC-155" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover {{sic}} to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Akhmed Zakayev]], head of the secular wing of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen separatist movement]], now in exile in London, condemned the bombing as "terrorist" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people, saying that "the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-156" /&gt;

The [[Caucasus Emirate|Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan]], the [[North Caucasian Federal District|Caucasian]] Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-157" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-158" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-159" /&gt;

=== Criticism of "shelter-in-place" directive and house-to-house searches ===
During the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor [[Deval Patrick]] said "we are asking people to shelter in place." The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request." [[Scott Silliman]], emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary.&lt;ref name="Rawlings"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/04/19/was-boston-actually-on-lockdown/|title=Was Boston Actually on Lockdown?|work=Time|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of ''[[The Observer]]'' said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and "are more primed to … assume the absolute worst."&lt;ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /&gt; Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing [[Christopher Dorner]] in 2013 and the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in 2002), but noted that "lockdown" measures were not used in those cases.&lt;ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /&gt;  Former congressman and presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]], criticized what he described as a "military-style takeover of parts of Boston" during the investigation and wrote that "this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself."&lt;ref name="RPaul" /&gt;

''[[Haaretz]]''{{-'}}s Chemi Salev wrote that "in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph" since the "relatively amateurish" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; Responding to Salev in ''The New York Times'', [[Ross Douthat]] commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as [[Mohammed Atta]].&lt;ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /&gt; Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time.&lt;ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /&gt;

The [[National Lawyers Guild]] and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/news/watertown/2013/11/lawyers_to_speak_about_unconstitutional_watertown_home_searc.html| author=Jaclyn Reiss| title=Lawyers raising questions about Watertown home searches following Marathon bombings, shootout| publisher=Boston Globe| date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/watertown-door-door-search-bombing-suspects-violation-fourth-140043137.html?ref=gs| author=Liz Klimas| title=Was Watertown’s Door-to-Door Search for Bombing Suspects a Violation of the Fourth Amendment?| publisher=Yahoo News| date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/22/the-police-response-to-the-boston-marathon-bombing/| author=Radley Balko| title=Was the police response to the Boston bombing really appropriate?| publisher=The Washington Post| date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting reports ==
[[File:Boston Marathon bombings news conference.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boston Police Department#List of Boston Police Commissioners|Boston Police Commissioner]] [[Edward F. Davis]] gives a [[news conference]] about the bombing on April 15. Governor [[Deval Patrick]] is second from right and Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley is at far left.]]

On the afternoon of the bombing, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-160" /&gt; That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-163" /&gt; The ''Post'' did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-164" /&gt; The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-165" /&gt;

The ''New York Post'' on its April 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from [[Revere, Massachusetts]], turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-169" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; ''New York Post'' editor [[Col Allan]] stated, "We stand by our story. The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects." The two were implied to be possible suspects via [[crowdsourcing]] on the websites [[Reddit]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; and [[4chan]].&lt;ref name="Reconsidering the Internet detectives in Boston manhunt on Reddit and 4Chan: the benefits and pitfalls" /&gt;

Several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-170" /&gt; Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were a 17-year-old track star and [[Sunil Tripathi]], a [[Brown University]] student missing since March.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Missing Brown University student's family dragged into virally fueled false accusation in Boston" /&gt; Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the [[Providence River]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-172" /&gt;

On April 17, the FBI released the following statement:
{{Quote|Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-173" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-174" /&gt;}}

The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-175" /&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
A film about the Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent manhunt, ''[[Patriots Day (film)|Patriots Day]]'', was released in December 2016. Another film, ''[[Stronger (film)|Stronger]]'', which chronicles survivor [[Jeff Bauman]], was released in September 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">A '''Cann table''' or '''Visual league table''', is a method of displaying data in a [[league table]].

The purpose of the table is to give some idea of the actual points gap between the teams in the league by listing them next to their current points total. Where teams are tied on points, teams are then ranked by goal difference from left to right and games played are shown in brackets. Unlike a traditional league table, a row is left blank if no team has the corresponding number of points.  

It is named posthumously after Jenny Cann, an [[Arsenal F.C.]] supporter who published the style, a ''visual table'', on her website the 'Clock End'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyons |first=Keith |title=Jenny Cann|url=https://keithlyons.me/blog/2018/04/10/jenny-cann/|accessdate=10 April 2018|date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from 1998. She died in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One To Go: What to Watch For in the Final Weekend of EPL Action|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachslaton/2012/05/10/one-to-go-what-to-watch-for-in-the-final-weekend-of-epl-action/|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=17 January 2014|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Congressional Soccer Match''' is an annual [[association football|soccer]] game played each summer by members of the [[United States Congress]]. The game began in 2013 and in its current format in 2014. In the match, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] form separate teams and play against each other. The event is hosted by the [[United States Soccer Foundation]] and generally features members of the Congressional Soccer Caucus, and former professional players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United legends competing in sixth annual Congressional Soccer Match |url=https://www.dcunited.com/post/2018/05/15/united-legends-competing-sixth-annual-congressional-soccer-match |website=DCUnited.com |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money raised from the match is donated to local charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charity soccer match benefiting children living in underserved communities. |url=https://ussoccerfoundation.org/events/congressional-soccer-match |website=U.S. Soccer Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crowd abuse''' or '''barracking''' refers to the widespread practice of crowds following various [[sport]]s to criticise or abuse opponents, by shouting, chanting, singing or through the use of banners in the [[stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7020854.stm|title=Chelsea angry at Grant barracking|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 September 2007|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation for crowd abuse includes gaining a [[psychology|psychological]] advantage over an opponent, either individually or as a team. Examples of the effectiveness of such techniques can be found in any major sport, including some dangerous outcomes such as the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|Malice in the palace]] (Pacers-Pistons Brawl).

[[Pacers–Pistons brawl|Malice at the Palace]] featured both physical and verbal crowd abuse, and contributed to many player's careers changing in the blink of an eye. Ron Artest was suspended for the rest of the season, stagnated on his basketball improvements, and was traded 16 games into the next season, ending the era of his [[Indiana Pacers|Pacers]] team/dynasty. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2014/11/19/7246943/malice-at-the-palace-anniversary-pacers-pistons-ron-artest|title=How 'Malice at the Palace' changed 6 NBA careers|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2004, five Pacers players and five fans were charged with assault and battery.

Drag flicking is a scoring technique in the sport of [[field hockey]]. It was first seen in the late 1980s in Australia. [[Jay Stacy]] (former record holder for most caps for the Kookaburras) is credited as first using the skill in the 1987 Australian Hockey Championships in Hobart.  It is used as an attacking technique, mainly within [[penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corner]] involving two main components known as the scoop and flick. However, as umpires become more and more strict within field hockey as new discoveries of techniques and training are subsequently making the sport more dangerous while also increasing the pace of the game. Therefore, it is evident that the drag flick is becoming more and more popular means of scoring even outside the penalty corner advantage. Although it is a somewhat dangerous piece of play for the opposition, it is within the rules and an effective technique for scoring. The drag flick involves a running up, and then forceful 'slinging' technique of the ball around your body, towards the goals. As drag flicking is not hitting the ball, the flicker is allowed to raise the ball at goals, hence making it a much more deadly alternative to hitting from the penalty corner as direct hitting shots on goal are not allowed to be above backboard height (460mm) during these set pieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202012-interactif.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The action involves a player crouching low down next to the ball and picking it up on the shaft of the [[field hockey stick|hockey stick]]. The ball is then pushed along the ground whilst the stick is moving with a 'slinging' action. This serves to accelerate the ball, which is eventually released in a goalwards direction, often raised.

Drag flicks are especially common during penalty corners, and are used as a variant to the 'straight shot' or hit. The main difference between the drag flick and the hit is that the drag flick is classified in the rules of field hockey, as a push, which are allowed to be raised higher from a penalty corner first shot. This has created a controversy, as drag flicks, although being allowed to be lifted at goals (and consequently the defenders within the goal), are often nearly as powerful as a hit. This leads to danger and a high risk of injuries.

The differentiation to a simple flick is that for drag-flicking the player accelerates the ball from behind, leveraging the ball past his body and thus achieving a higher speed. Flicks are often used to quickly transfer the ball to an attacker when defence inhibits a flat pass. Besides, the technique of drag-flicking is not easy to perform when the ball is moving.

As drag flicks have become more popular, specialist hockey sticks have been designed to complement the slinging action of the shot. These sticks are notable for their 'bow' or curve. An example of this would be hockey equipment manufacturer [[Grays International]]'s Jumbow and Megabow range, which featured sticks from their GX series with greatly increased curvature. In 2005, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) limited the possible size of 'bows' allowed in international competitions which is now limited to 25&amp;nbsp;mm. The reason for this was that sticks with extravagant bows began to emerge. This led to dangerous levels of power being generated. (see [[Field Hockey#Equipment]]).

However, there have been recent calls for further changes to the FIH rulings. The FIH official rules states that a bow's maximum curvature from a rest position can be no more than 25&amp;nbsp;mm. To traverse this, many top stick manufacturers began to build sticks with one significantly heavier edge than the other, thus, when the stick was put at rest, it tilted to one side, reducing the measure curvature. Using this loophole, many stick manufacturers have produced sticks that have bows much greater than 25&amp;nbsp;mm, sometimes even exceeding 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

Along with changes in stick topography, as the drag flick became more prolific, it introduced the specialist drag flicker into a hockey team. In some cases, the drag flicker was not even part of the standard team but was substituted for a field player whenever a team was awarded a penalty corner. As soon as the penalty corner was over, the substitution was reversed. Because of this, it is now disallowed to substitute whenever a penalty corner situation is in effect, except for an injured goalkeeper, who may be substituted at any time. If a field player is injured during a penalty corner and has to leave the field for medical attention, a replacement player cannot enter the field until the penalty corner ends. [[Calum Giles]] (GB) was noted for being the best drag-flicker during this time, scoring 110 goals in 143 caps. Most national teams have a flicking expert within their sides, with some notable figures including [[Sohail Abbas]] of Pakistan, [[Sandeep Singh]], [[VR Ragunath]] and [[Rupinder Pal Singh]] of India, [[Taeke Taekema]] of the Netherlands, [[Troy Elder]] of Australia and [[Hayden Shaw]] of New Zealand.
Generally speed of drag flicks are in excess of 80&amp;nbsp;mph .

These exercise trends are contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases including: [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[high cholesterol]].&lt;ref name="CDC2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/physicalactivity/physicalactivity.htm|title=N C H S - Health E Stats -  Physical Activity Among Adults: United States, 2000 and 2005|work=CDC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active transport (walking, bicycling, etc.) has been found to be inversely related to obesity in Europe, North America, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bassett DR, Pucher J, Buehler R, Thompson DL, Crouter SE|title=Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America, and Australia|journal=J Phys Act Health|volume=5|issue=6|pages=795–814|date=November 2008|pmid=19164816|doi=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus exercise has been associated with a decrease in mortality.&lt;ref name=CDC2007/&gt;

==Causes of lack of exercise==
{{See also|Sedentary lifestyle|Lack of physical education}}
One of the causes most prevalent in the developing world is urbanization.  As more of the population moves to cities, population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime, high-density traffic, low air quality and lack of parks, sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;

Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including: young people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Young People|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_women/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Women|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_olderadults/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Older Adults|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 population study in south Brazil showed physical inactivity during leisure time to be more prevalent among females and those living with a partner; with a positive correlation associated with age and number of cigarettes smoked, and a negative correlation (decreased levels of physical inactivity) associated with years of formal education, body mass index, and increasing socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=Brazil2005/&gt;

Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and the [[prevalence]] of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gortmaker SL, Must A, Sobol AM, Peterson K, Colditz GA, Dietz WH|title=Television viewing as a cause of increasing obesity among children in the United States, 1986–1990|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|volume=150|issue=4|pages=356–62|date=April 1996|pmid=8634729|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290022003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vioque J, Torres A, Quiles J|title=Time spent watching television, sleep duration and obesity in adults living in Valencia, Spain|journal=Int.

Emanuel|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause in the case of children is that physical activity in activities from self-propelled transport, to school physical education, and organized sports is declining in many countries.&lt;ref name="Kids2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L|title=Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=39|issue=12|pages=892–7; discussion 897|date=December 2005|pmid=16306494|pmc=1725088|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
[[Noncommunicable diseases]], partly due to a lack of exercise, are currently the greatest [[public health]] problem in most countries around the world.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;  Each year at least 1.9 million people die as a result of physical inactivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/en/|title=WHO &amp;#124; Why "Move for Health"|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which makes inactivity one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ|title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data|journal=Lancet|volume=367|issue=9524|pages=1747–57|date=May 2006|pmid=16731270|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==

===Australia===
Australian children between 1961 and 2002 have had a marked decline in their aerobic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomkinson GR, Olds TS|title=Secular changes in aerobic fitness test performance of Australasian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=168–82|year=2007|pmid=17387257|doi=10.1159/0000101361|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Obese people are less active than their normal weight counterparts.  In Canada, 27.0% of [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] men are obese as opposed to 19.6% of active men.&lt;ref name="Tjepkema2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tjepkema M|chapter=Measured Obesity–Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight|title=Nutrition: Findings from the Canadian Community Health Survey|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=2005-07-06|location=Ottawa, Ontario|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean people are more fidgety than their obese counterparts; this relationship is maintained even if normal weight people eat more or the obese person loses weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levine JA, Lanningham-Foster LM, McCrady SK, Krizan AC, Olson LR, Kane PH, Jensen MD, Clark MM|title=Interindividual variation in posture allocation: Possible role in human obesity|journal=Science|year=2005|pages=584–6|volume=307|issue=5709|pmid=15681386|doi=10.1126/science.1106561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National data indicates that only 10% of Canadian youth are meeting the guideline for screen time of less than 2 hours per day.  As well, although 2/3 of families live close enough for their children to bike or walk to school, only 1/3 report actually walking to school and 80% report never having cycled to school.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Asia and China===
A study from China found [[urbanization]] reduced daily energy expenditure by about 300–400 kcal and going to work by car or bus reduced it by a further 200 kcal.&lt;ref name="James2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=James WP|title=The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic|journal=Obes Rev|volume=9|issue=s1|pages=6–13|date=March 2008|pmid=18307693|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid decline in physical activity has occurred between the 1980s and the 2000s.  The decline in physical activity is attributed to increasing technology in the workplace and changing leisure activities.&lt;ref name="FAOChina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0442e/a0442e06.htm|title=The double burden of malnutrition Case studies from six developing countries|work=Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 65% of Chinese had jobs that required heavy labor.  This decreased to 51% in the year 2000.&lt;ref name=FAOChina/&gt;

Among Asian children between 1917 and 2003 little change has been seen in power and speed however endurance has decreased substantially in the last 10–15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macfarlane DJ, Tomkinson GR|title=Evolution and variability in fitness test performance of Asian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=143–67|year=2007|pmid=17387256|doi=10.1159/0000101358|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In [[Finland]] leisure-time physical activity has increased, while occupational and commuting physical activity has decreased from 1972 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Fin2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borodulin K, Laatikainen T, Juolevi A, Jousilahti P|title=Thirty-year trends of physical activity in relation to age, calendar time and birth cohort in Finnish adults|journal=Eur J Public Health|volume=18|issue=3|pages=339–44|date=June 2008|pmid=17875578|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm092|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leisure-time physical activity increased from 66% (1972) to 77% (2002) in men and from 49% (1972)to 76% (2002) in women.  Physically demanding work decreased from 60% (1972) to 38% (2002) in men and from 47% (1972) to 25% (2002) in women.  Daily commuting activity decreased from 30% (1972) to 10% (2002) in men and from 34% (1972) to 22% (2002) in women.&lt;ref name=Fin2008/&gt;

===Netherlands===
As of 2007 [[walking]] and [[cycling]] as a means of transport In the [[Netherlands]] has been stable since 1994. The average Dutch citizen in the year 2007 walked {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} and cycled {{convert|908|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37338&amp;D1=2&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=6-7&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=a&amp;HDR=G1,T,G4,G2&amp;STB=G3,G5&amp;VW=T|title=statline.cbs.nl|work=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|accessdate=Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossFit has been a trend in The Netherlands since 2012. It is a unique training program that combines a [[physical exercise]] philosophy and a competitive fitness sport.  '''CrossFit''' workouts use elements from [[high-intensity interval training]], [[Olympic weightlifting]], [[plyometrics]], [[powerlifting]], [[gymnastics]] and other exercises. It is very successful around the world and has 13,000 members in affiliated [[Gym|gyms]].

Personal training is gaining more and more popularity in the Netherlands in the last 15 years. A '''personal trainer''' is a trainer certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in [[exercise prescription]] and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback to clients. 

Obstacle training centrums are very popular in The Netherlands since companies like [[:nl:Unitedfit|UNITEDFIT]] have included the social aspect to training for an obstacle course. An '''obstacle course''' is a series of challenging physical obstacles an individual or a team need to complete while being timed. Obstacle courses can include [[running]], [[climbing]], [[jumping]], [[Crawling (human)|crawling]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], and [[Balance (ability)|balancing]] elements with the aim of testing speed and endurance. Sometimes a course involves [[Mind|mental]] tests.

Over 60% of the population of [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]] do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity needed to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14662071|volume=14|issue=4|title=Rapid changes in lifestyle make increased physical activity a priority for the Americas|date=October 2003|vauthors=Jacoby E, Bull F, Neiman A|journal=Rev.

===Sweden===
A study of Swedish males found a significant decrease in total physical exercise even though recreational exercise has increased.  This was due to a decrease in work place exercise and physical exercise in transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norman A, Bellocco R, Vaida F, Wolk A|title=Age and temporal trends of total physical activity in Swedish men|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=35|issue=4|pages=617–22|date=April 2003|pmid=12673145|doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000058357.23080.F4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>At the beginning right after "fitness trail",  I believe the correct term is "parcourse" not "paracourse".</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14577">A '''fitness trail''' or '''parcourse''' consists of a [[wikt:path|path]] or [[wikt:course|course]] with outdoor [[exercise equipment]] or [[obstacle]]s installed along its length for [[Exercise|exercising]] the human [[Human body|body]] to promote good [[health]].  The course is designed to promote [[physical fitness]] training in the style attributed to [[Georges Hébert]].  In general, fitness trails can be natural or man-made, located in areas such as forest, transportation rights-of-way, parks, or urban settings.  Equipment exists to provide specific forms of physiological exercise, and can consist of natural features including climbable rocks, trees, and river embankments, or manufactured products (stepping posts, chin-up and climbing bars) designed to provide similar physical challenges.  The [[degree of difficulty]] of a course is determined by terrain slope, trail surface (dirt, grass, gravel, etc.), obstacle height (walls) or length (crawls) and other features.  Urban parcourses tend to be flat, to permit participation by the elderly, and to accommodate cyclists, runners, skaters and walking. The new concept of an [[outdoor gym]], containing traditional gym equipment specifically designed for outdoor use, is also considered to be a development of the parcourse. These outdoor exercise gyms include moving parts and are often made from galvanised metal.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2016}}
The '''grandfather rule''', in sports which usually only permit participants to play for the team of their country of birth, is an exception which gives participants the option to play for the country of any of their ancestors up to the grandparents.  Despite common name for the rule, grandparents of either sex can be invoked equally and it is sometimes referred to as the '''grandparent rule''' or the '''granny rule'''.

==Examples==
===Rugby league===
In [[rugby league]], the [[RLIF]] reiterated in 2008 that a player may represent a country if it is their country, or the country of their parents or any of their grandparents' birth.&lt;ref name="SS-31-07-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12196_3890777,00.html |title=World Cup rules spelled out|date=2008-07-31|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union===
In [[rugby union]], regulation 8.1 of [[World Rugby]] stipulates that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/reg-8 |title=Regulation 8: Eligibility to Play for National Representative Teams |work=World Rugby Regulations Relating to the Game |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a Player may only play for the [Team] (...) of the country with which the Player has a genuine, close, credible and established national link in which:
(a) he was born; or
(b) one parent or grandparent was born; or (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "grandparent" was at one time defined to include only blood grandparents, even for individuals who were legally adopted. However, World Rugby's current interpretation of its regulations accounts for cases in which a player, or his or her blood parent, was adopted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/explanatory-guidelines |title=Regulation 8 Explanatory Guidelines |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unless a Player has been adopted in accordance with the formal, legal requirements of the country concerned, the application of this criterion will be based on a Player’s blood parent. When a Player has been formally adopted in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned, the birth place of the Player’s blood parent will no longer be relevant for the purposes of establishing the Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b). The relevant parent will be the parent that has formally and legally adopted the Player. In such circumstances, the relevant grandparents for the purposes of establishing a Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s adoptive rather than blood grandparents. It is not possible under Regulation 8.1(b) to assume eligibility via blood grandparents if a Player has been formally and legally adopted. In the event that one of the Player’s blood parents has been adopted, the relevant grandparents for the purpose of establishing that Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s blood parent’s adoptive parents. The term “parent” in the Regulations is limited to either a blood parent or a parent that has formally adopted a Player in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This exception is also incorporated directly into certain national regulations which govern the club-level teams from that country, as shown by regulation 9.14.2.1 of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishrugby.ie/downloads/IRFU_Regulations_.pdf |title=Regulation 9.14.2: Eligibility of Players |work=Regulations of the Irish Rugby Football Union |publisher=Irish Rugby Football Union |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The following are the registered players who are eligible to play in the All Ireland League and Cup:
(i) A Player who qualifies to play for Ireland under World Rugby Regulations. (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Association football (soccer)===
In [[association football]], this rule can be found at the international level in the statutes of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), in articles 6 and 7.  The former states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/01/66/54/21/fifastatutes2012e.pdf|title=FIFA Statutes, July 2012 edition|accessdate=29 March 2013|publisher=''[[FIFA.com]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
if, in addition to having the relevant
nationality, he fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
a) He was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
b) His biological mother or biological father was born on the territory of
the relevant Association;
c) His grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the
relevant Association; (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that unlike World Rugby, which now substitutes adoptive parents for birth parents in determining national team eligibility, FIFA continues to use only biological relations for this purpose.

Among the most notable countries to have availed of the "granny rule" is the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], where the wide spread of the [[Irish diaspora]] left large numbers of potential recruits, especially in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/the-granny-rule-we-chart-who-has-come-on-board-who-shunned-us-and-the-undecided-31566207.html|title=The granny rule - We chart who has come on board, who shunned us and the undecided - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Charlton]] (manager 1986–96) was especially noted for recruiting English-born footballers who had Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-history/granny-rule.htm|title=Granny Rule in Football : Non Irish Born Footballers for Republic of Ireland : Shay Brennan : Irish Qualified : Jack Chalton|website=www.soccer-ireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many German-born players who have Turkish ancestry have chosen to play for [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. This is partly due to Germany's strict rules on dual citizenship which forces German-Turks to choose whether to have German or Turkish citizenship by the age of 23 (in accordance with the German Citizenship Law of 1999).

===Basketball===
[[FIBA]], the international governing body for [[basketball]], requires nationality as a precondition for national team selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-15: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generally does not employ the grandparent rule. The method by which a player obtains citizenship is usually irrelevant to national team eligibility. The only use of the grandparent rule is to determine eligibility to represent the national team of a country's dependent territory, with two notable examples being those of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]], both [[United States|US]] [[insular area]]s with their own national federations, and whose native-born residents are US citizens by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-26: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIBA, however, has a unique restriction on participation of naturalised players in its official competitions that has no parallel in association football or either rugby code. In FIBA competitions, a national team can have no more than one player on its roster who acquired that country's nationality by any means after reaching age 16. This restriction also applies to individuals who had the right to a second nationality at birth, but did not exercise that right until age 16 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-21: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is relevant to natives of [[Northern Ireland]], who have both [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] and [[Irish nationality law|the right to Irish citizenship]] by birth.

==Effects on teams==
A controversial rule, sports fans often debate whether this rule weakens smaller countries by creating the temptation for the best players to abandon their native country and declare elsewhere in the hopes of greater glory, or if on the contrary it helps smaller countries by giving them access to a broader range of players who wouldn't typically be considered to be picked for their country of birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4311">'''High performance sport''' or '''elite sport''' is sport at the highest level of competition. 
In [[sports administration]] "high performance sport", where the emphasis is on winning prestigious competitions, is distinguished from "mass sport" or "[[recreation]]al sport", where the emphasis is on attracting the maximum number of participants.

High performance sport overlaps with [[professional sport]] but is not the same; for example, the [[English football league system]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] include lower divisions whose teams' members are full-time professionals. On the other hand, elite competitors at the [[Olympic Games]] or [[World Games]] in some minority sports may be part-time or rely on government grants. Likewise, [[student athlete]]s, especially in [[college sports]], are often high performance despite being amateurs.

Much research in [[sports psychology]] and [[sports medicine]] is motivated by the needs of elite rather than mass athletes. [[Doping in sport]] is more common at elite levels, and research into [[performance-enhancing substance]]s has been fuelled by the drive for success.

Separate state agencies may be responsible for high performance sport and for mass sport; [[Sports governing body|national governing bodies]] for a particular sport often have separate administrative units for supporting élite athletes and for administering mass competitions. [[National Olympic Committee]]s are often concerned with high performance sport, including the funding of athletes likely to win [[Olympic medal]]s. In [[public policy]], funding for high performance sport may be justified for reasons of national prestige or as a marketing tool for encouraging mass sport. [[Eastern bloc]] countries invested in elite sport during the [[Cold War]]; Western countries began establishing '''Institutes of Sport''' for a similar purpose from the 1980s, with '''sports academies''' for nurturing promising young athletes. Such institutes may set goals in terms of national ranking on the [[Olympic medal table]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6786">The '''International Sporting Code''' (ISC) is a set of rules which are valid for all [[auto racing]] events that are governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  [[North America]]n domestic racing, such as [[NASCAR]] and [[IndyCar]] are outside the FIA's jurisdiction and hence not governed by the ISC. [[Motorcycle sport]] is also exempt since the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM) is responsible for this sport, not the FIA.

The ISC consists of 17 chapters and several [[Addendum#Books|appendices]]. It contains definitions, general principles, and regulations, as well as rules for race organizers, contenders, racers, and official [[referee]]s. As the sport of motor racing is very [[hierarchy|hierarchic]], the ISC also determines the rules of national racing federations.

==Summary==

The ISC consists of 17 chapters. In the first chapter it is determined that the FIA is the sole international sporting authority entitled to make and enforce regulations regarding automobile competitions. It is further determined that the ISC is a regulation to encourage and facilitate international motor sport. Each national autosport club or federation affiliated with the FIA is allowed to draw up their own rules. The ISC will not be enforced, as long competition is safe and fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Sporting Code|year=2013|publisher=Fédération International de l'Automobile|page=Chapter I|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/C57D2C7837004DC3C125734B0032A5A2/$FILE/CSI%2024.10.2006%20modif%20ap%20AGO%20oct%2006%20revu%2016.05.07ANG.pdf?Openelement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to records the ISC differentiates between international records and local records. Local records established on a permanent or temporary track fall within the scope of the national federation of that country. [[International Sporting Code#Appendix D|Appendix D]] applies to international records.

===Kinds of racing===
This chapter features articles about what kind of vehicles exist and what kind of motor sport competitions exist.

* [[Race track|Circuit race]]
An event held on a closed circuit between two or more vehicles, running at the same time on the same course, in which speed or the distance covered in a given time is the determining factor.

* [[Dragracing|Drag race]]
An acceleration contest between two vehicles racing from a standing start over a straight, precisely measured course in which the first vehicle to cross the finish line (without penalty) achieves the better performance

* [[Hillclimbing|Hill Climb]]
An event in which each vehicle takes the start individually to cover the same course ending with a finish line situated at a higher altitude than the start line. The time 
taken to cover the distance between the start and finish lines is the determining factor for establishing the classifications.

* [[Rally racing|Rally]]
Road event with an imposed average speed, which is run entirely or partly on roads open to normal traffic. A rally consists either of a single itinerary which must be followed by all cars, or of several itineraries converging on a same rallying-point fixed beforehand and followed or not by a common itinerary.

* [[Rally raid|Cross-Country Rally]] and Baja Cross-Country Rallies
The length of each selective section must be no more than 500&amp;nbsp;km and the total length of the event must be at least 800&amp;nbsp;km.

* Marathon Cross-Country Rallies 
The total course must be at least 10,000&amp;nbsp;km and the distance of the legs is free. The total duration may not exceed 31 days, including [[scrutineering]] and [[prologue]]. Only cars in Groups T ([[Group T1|T1]], [[Group T2|T2]], [[Group T3|T3]], [[Group T4|T4]]) may be admitted.

===Further regulations===
The ISC further regulates what kind of officials exist, penalties when a breach of rules appears and how to protest and appeal.

==Notable appendices==

===Appendix D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix D - Regulations For Land Speed Record Attempts|year=2013|publisher=Fédération International de l'Automobile|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/basicpage/file/Appendix%20D_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Appendix D of the ISC further regulates attempts at [[land speed records]]. In accordance to the appendix, world records can only be set in four categories:
* Category A: special automobiles built for land speed record attempts
* Category B: series production automobiles (like the [[Bugatti Veyron]])
* Category VII: [[solar car racing|solar powered]] vehicles (like the [[UNSW Sunswift]])
* Category XI: [[hybrid power]]ed vehicles (like the [[Buckeye Bullet]])
* Category C: special vehicles with any kind of engine and the use of aerodynamic aid is allowed (like the [[ThrustSSC]])
* Category D: [[Dragracing|drag race]] cars

Each category could be further subdivided in groups according to [[engine type]].
The appendix also features different types of records e.a. acceleration records, distance records (flying start) or distance records (standing start).

===Appendix J===
Appendix J was introduced by the FIA in 1954, initially for Touring Cars and GT Cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/regulation/file/2014_Appendix%20K_WEB%20%28140108%29.pdf ''Appendix K to the International Sporting Code'', www.fia.com] Retrieved on 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates what kind of cars race in what classes and what the specifications are. Currently Appendix J features three categories and fifteen groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix J|year=2013|publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/regulation/file/251%20%282013%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category I: Series production cars
** [[Group N]]: Production cars
** [[Group A]]: Touring cars
** [[Group R]]: Touring cars or large scale series production cars 
** [[Group T1]]
** [[Group T2]]
* Category II: Competition cars
** [[Group R|Group RGT]]: GT production cars
** [[Group GT1]]: Grand Touring cars
** [[Group GT2]]: Grand Touring cars
** [[Group GT3]]: Cup Grand Touring cars
** [[Group CN]]: Production sports cars
** [[Group D (FIA)|Group D]]: International [[formula racing]] cars
** [[Group E (FIA)|Group E]]: Free formula racing cars
** [[Group T3]]
* Category III: Trucks
** [[Group F (FIA)|Group F]]: Racing trucks
** [[Group T4]]

For each group specific rules are further defined in the regulations. Group D, which features [[Formula 1]] and [[Formula 3]], has specific regulations (technical and sporting) for each class.

[[File:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|thumb|right|alt=wheelchair basketball|Wheelchair basketball teams playing in the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
The concept of '''international sport''' refers to [[sport]] when the participants represent at least two countries. The most well-known international sports event is the [[Olympic Games]]. Other examples include the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Paralympic Games]].

Modern international sports events are big business for as well as influencing the political, economical, and other cultural aspects of countries around the world. Especially with [[politics and sports]], sports can affect countries, their identities, and in consequence, the world.

==History==
The ancient [[Olympic Games]] were a series of competitions held between representatives of several [[city-states]] and kingdoms from [[Ancient Greece]], which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games, all struggles between the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=2000|edition=2|page=54|isbn=0-292-70373-2|oclc=10759486|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-HQMnDiLqIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA54,M1|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend.&lt;ref&gt;Young (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the Olympic Games became a popular global event.

==Economics==
While some economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such "mega-events" often have large costs, hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = A.

This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013.

''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 58(1): 111–148.].&lt;/ref&gt; The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glynn | first1 = M.

[[Globalization]] has continually increased international competition in sports. The [[FIFA World Cup]], for example, is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 700 million people watched the final match of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=700 million to watch World Cup Final |work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/ |accessdate=12 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715052728/https://trendonwords.com |archivedate=15 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 A.T. Kearney study of sports teams, leagues and federations, the global sports industry is worth between €350 billion and €450 billion ([[US$]]480-$620 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkearney.com/paper/-/asset_publisher/dVxv4Hz2h8bS/content/the-sports-market/10192  ''The Sports Market'' (2011). A.T. Kearney.]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes infrastructure construction, sporting goods, licensed products and live sports events.

== Olympic Games factor of the globalization of sports ==

=== An international retransmission ===

The Olympics are a major factor in the globalization of sport.
The Olympic symbol is the most recognized symbol, and the Olympic Games are broadcast around the world. This represents 4.5 billion of people for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/IOC_Marketing/Broadcasting/Beijing_2008_Global_Broadcast_Overview.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olympic Games globalization===

The Olympic Games have also undergone globalization.
The first Olympic Games of the modern era were held in 1896, only 9 disciplines were present and 241 athletes but only men. The place of women is representative of the position of women in society, and from the first Olympiad 1900 women participated but unofficially. It is in 1920 that the first women were officially part of the Olympic Games.

The number of athletes present at each Olympiad hast been increasing significantly since the first Olympiad:

* In 1896 at the first Olympic games 14 countries were represented by 241 athletes for 43 events;
* 1960 Rome Olympic games have grouped 83 countries for a total of 5338 athletes who competed in 150 different events;
* London 2012, 204 countries were present representing 10,568 athletes for a total of 302 events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13061">In the United States and Canada, a '''jock''' is a [[stereotype]] of an athlete, or someone who is primarily interested in sports and sports culture, and does not take much interest in [[intellectual]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/jock#jock-2|title=Jock: definition of Jock in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=jock&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary on Jock |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally  attributed mostly to [[high school]] and [[college]] athletics participants who form a distinct [[youth subculture]]. As a [[blanket term]], ''jock'' can be considered synonymous with ''athlete''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=jock |title=Princeton's WordNet entry on Jock |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jocks are usually presented as practitioners of [[team sports]], such as football, basketball, baseball and hockey.

Similar words that may mean the same as ''jock'' (in North America) include  ''meathead,'' ''musclebrain,'' and ''musclehead.''&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt; These terms are based on the stereotype that a jock is muscular but not very smart, and cannot carry a conversation on any topic other than one relating to sports and exercise.

"Jock" is also a derogatory word used by the [[England|English]] towards [[Scotland|Scottish]] men.

== Origin ==

The use of the term "jock" to refer to an athletic man is thought to have emerged around 1963.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; It is believed to be derived from the word "[[jockstrap]]," which is an undergarment worn to support/protect the male genitals while playing sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KXdKLDym2QC&amp;pg=PA146|title=An Introduction to English Slang|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jocks are often contrasted with another stereotype: [[nerd]]s. This [[dichotomy]] is a theme in many American movies, television shows, and books.

In the United Kingdom, the term 'Jock' is a stereotypical (possibly, but not necessarily, derogatory) term for a Scotsman.

== Stereotypes ==
Various characteristics of the jock stereotype include:

* Aggressive, [[wikt:arrogant|arrogant]], [[Meanness|mean]], [[egotism|egotistical]], easily offended and short-tempered&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web |title=Jocks as a Youth Subculture |publisher=Center for Mental Health in Schools, School Mental Health Project, Department of Psychology, UCLA, Los Angeles |url=http://smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/youth/jocks.pdf |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Muscular, [[height|tall]] and athletic&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt;
* Does not cry or otherwise show weakness or fear&lt;ref name="ander"&gt;{{cite book | last =  [[Eric Anderson (sociologist)|Anderson]] | first = Eric | title = 21st century jocks : sporting men and contemporary heterosexuality | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137550668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Afraid to hug or hold a friend too long 
* [[Blond]] hair
* Popular
* Often [[bullying]] others who lack athletic ability
* Frequently given privileges, such as undeserved passing grades and/or excused from bad conduct, to maintain eligibility for sports
* Being [[homophobia|homophobic]]&lt;ref name="ander"/&gt;

== Portrayal in the media ==
Jocks are often present in [[book]]s, [[movie]]s, and [[television show]]s involving [[high school]] and [[college]]. The stereotype is most prevalent in movies for teenagers such as ''[[College (2008 film)|College]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', and the ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' movies. The stereotype extends beyond the high-school and collegiate age group, trickling down into media intended for younger audiences. Examples of this include the high school football quarterback [[Dash Baxter]] in the Nickelodeon cartoon ''[[Danny Phantom]]'' and Kevin from the Cartoon Network series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]''. Other notable portrayals of the stereotype include the popular athlete and love interest "Tommy Ross" in ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', the spoiled bullying antagonist [[Luke Ward]] in the first season of ''[[The O.C.]]'', and Kim's wealthy and athletic boyfriend Jim in ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''.

The [[mass media]] borrows many stereotypical characteristics of athletes, and they are commonly used to portray a character who is relatively unintelligent and unenlightened, but nonetheless socially and physically well-endowed. Usually, jocks will play aggressive sports such as [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Examples from television shows include Ryan Shay in the sitcom ''[[Suburgatory]]'' and Jimmy Armstrong ([[Dan Cortese]]) in the sitcom ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''. The main jock character often occupies a high position, such as the [[quarterback]] or captain of the football team. In many cases, the jock is shown to come from a [[wealthy]] family: driving a fancy, expensive sports car or [[SUV]], and wearing expensive, name-brand clothing; however, this is not always the case. In this regard, there may be significant overlap with the [[preppie]] stereotype.

As a [[protagonist]], the jock is often a dynamic character who through an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] or new understanding will lead to a change in the [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s of the jock. This change often means a cessation of athletics and/or some other equivalent social sacrifice, which leads to the character no longer being considered a jock. Examples from movies include Randall "Pink" Floyd in ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'' and Andrew Clark in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''. Examples from television shows include [[Nathan Scott]] in the teen drama series ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', [[Whitney Fordman]] in ''[[Smallville]]'' and [[Luke Ward]] in ''[[The O.C.]]''.

As [[antagonist]]s, jocks can be [[stock character]]s shown as lacking compassion for the [[protagonist]] and are generally [[Dynamic character#Round vs. Flat|flat]] and [[Fictional character#Dynamic vs. static|static]]. Often in high school comedies and/or dramas where the main characters are not popular, the jock is the chief [[antagonist]] and cruel to the main characters. He is disliked by the nerds and other people who are considered unpopular, and usually has an unfortunate (and in some cases, violent and/or fatal) ending. ''[[Heathers]]''' "Kurt" and "Ram" roles, the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' character [[Flash Thompson]], high school [[American football|football]] jocks and [[Connie D'Amico]]'s cronies Scott and Doug in ''[[Family Guy]]'', high school football captain Oliver Wilkerson in ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', [[Jean Grey]]'s first boyfriend [[List of X-Men: Evolution characters#Other villains|Duncan Matthews]] in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', middle school bully and "Crush Ball" player Rodney Glaxer from ''[[Lloyd in Space]]'', and Massimo Lenzetti ([[Justin Chambers]]) in the [[film]] ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' are such examples. There are also numerous jock antagonists found in teen dramas such as the rapist Dean Walton from ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation|Degrassi]]''.

On the show ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'', [[Emily Fields]] is the [[athlete|athletic]] one of the group. In the 1978 movie ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' [[Danny Zuko]] changed his [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] look for jock to impress Sandy. In the 2006 hit movie ''[[High School Musical]]'', [[Troy Bolton]] was a star jock of [[East High School (High School Musical)|East High School]] in addition to other characters [[Chad Danforth]], Zeke Baylor, and also Troy's father [[Jack Bolton (High School Musical)|Jack Bolton]]. In 2013's ''[[Monsters University]]'', Johnny Worthington is the proud leader of Roar Omega Roar (RΩR). Additionally, Kevin Thompson of ''[[Daria]]'', which satirized high school life, conformed to the "dumb" athlete stereotype, though was never mean towards lead character [[Daria Morgendorffer]] and her friend [[Jane Lane (Daria)|Jane Lane]]; another jock character, Mac Mackenzie, was depicted as intelligent and cordial to the main characters, and was never shown to be a bully even though he was often disturbed by Kevin's dimness.

==List of fictional Jocks==
*Brad Hayes in ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]''
*Brian Sommers in ''[[Glory Daze (TV series)|Glory Daze]]''
*[[Luke Ward]] in ''[[The O.C.]]''
*Mike Dexter in "[[Can't Hardly Wait]]"
*Troy Jeffries  in ''[[Beverly Hills Teens]]''
*[[Flash Thompson]] in "[[Spider-Man]]"
*Kevin in ''[[Ed, Edd and Eddy]]''
*Ram and Kurt in ''[[Heathers]]''

==Education and athletics==
The general perception that athletes are unintelligent is derived from the idea that athletic and academic success are mutually exclusive. Prior to 1990, many researchers were critical with respect to the impact of [[extracurricular activities]] and athletics in particular on education. According to the so-called "[[Zero sum game|Zero Sum]] Model," education and extracurriculars compete for student's time. However, later studies present a strong evidence that athletic or cultural extracurricular activities in school would increase school attendance, self-confidence, grade (in some instance), and college attendance but would reduce performance in standardized test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Correlations Between High School Athletic Participation and Academic Performance|first=Tim|last=Klein|year=2011|url=http://digitalcollections.dordt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059&amp;context=med_theses|type=Master of Education|publisher=Dordt College}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.naspspa.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/1289.pdf|title=School Athletic Participation: Mostly Gain With Little Pain|authors=Herbert W. Marsh and Sabina Kleitman |journal=Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=205–228|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that many schools recruit for sports, they put stipulations in place that require student athletes to maintain minimum academic grade in order to maintain their scholarships. Schools recruit students to their athletic teams, but require a student maintain a certain [[Grading (education)|grade-point average (GPA)]] in order to have the scholarship renewed. For many young athletes, this is imperative as they could not afford higher education on their own. Therefore, they balance enough study to remain eligible with the demands of their sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.blackvoicesonline.com/media/storage/paper1067/news/2008/10/21/Sports/Not-So.Dumb.Jocks.Truth.About.Black.Student.Athletes-3506273.shtml |title=Black Voices Online |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514051208/http://media.www.blackvoicesonline.com/media/storage/paper1067/news/2008/10/21/Sports/Not-So.Dumb.Jocks.Truth.About.Black.Student.Athletes-3506273.shtml |archivedate=May 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the college level in the United States, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] does have some education requirements that must be met for high school students to play in a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] school, and to be eligible for a scholarship. The most recent standards passed by the NCAA, which will apply to all incoming college freshmen beginning with the class of 2016, requires that 16 core high school courses be completed by the student-athlete, 7 of which must be either math, science, or English, and 10 of those 16 classes must be completed prior to their senior year of high school. As well, the students must graduate high school with a minimum 2.3 GPA (up from the 2.0 GPA requirement that was in place prior to these new standards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dana|title=Eligibility vs. academic preparedness|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8236949/ncaa-increases-minimum-eligibility-standards-division-student-athletes|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such requirements have been debated for years, however.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Ronald A.|title=Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform|year=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">A '''leisure centre''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Australia]] (also called aquatic centres) and [[Canada]] is a  purpose built building or site, usually owned and operated by the [[city]], [[borough council]] or municipal district [[Non-metropolitan district|council]], where people go to keep fit or relax through using the facilities.

== Typical facilities ==
Facilities may include a [[swimming pool]] (many with water slide), large sports hall, [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, [[cafeteria]], licensed bar, fitness suite, [[aerobics]] studios, outdoor grass and/or artificial pitches for [[football (soccer)]], [[hockey]] etc., a [[sunroom#Solarium|solarium]], [[sauna]] and/or [[steam room]].

Leisure centres Canada are staffed by leisure centre attendants employed by the local council.  They carry out a range of tasks to help and supervise people using leisure centre facilities and act as swimming pool life guards, gym instructors and coaches offering advice, motivation and expertise to users. Many of its functions may overlap with that of a [[community centre]].

Leisure centres are also popular in Australia, where they are mostly privately operated but Government funded. In that country they are often also called Recreation Centres, or most commonly Aquatic Centres due to the swimming facilities being the most popular facility that is available. 

In some areas of the UK and Canada (such as [[Calgary]]) these services are now operated by private companies on contract to the local authority.

Most towns in the UK are now introducing leisure facilities for the local community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3431">The '''Littlejohn of Invercharron Challenge Vase''', also known as the '''Littlejohn Vase''', is a trophy in [[University Shinty|university]] [[shinty]]. It is the second most expensive sporting trophy in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyecamanachd.com/default.aspx.locid-087new1mw.Lang-EN.htm|title=University Shinty – Littlejohn Vase.|website=www.skyecamanachd.com|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Scottish Cup (Football)|Scottish Cup]]. The Littlejohn Vase is competed for by university shinty teams on an annual basis, in a one-day event traditionally held at a different university every year, although since 2007 it has been held at St Andrews.

==The Vase==

The vase is a [[facsimile]] in [[silver]] of the [[Warwick Vase]] discovered in 1770 and on display at the [[Burrell Collection]], [[Glasgow]]. It is held in trust by the [[Sir Duncan Ricel Library|Aberdeen University Library]]. Due to its value a stand in [[quaich]] is given to the winning side as insurance costs mean the cup may not leave Aberdeen. In 1905 it was [[bequeath|bequeathed]] to [[Aberdeen University Shinty Club]] by [[Alexander Littlejohn]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The vase has been played for since 1905, the year of its bequeathment.[http://www.susport.org.uk/shinty.asp]

== English Premier Football ==
[[Martin Edwards]] asked Watkins to become a director of Manchester United Football Club in May 1984 on the same day as [[Bobby Charlton]]. In 1991, when Martin Edwards floated Manchester United on the stock exchange, Watkins joined the PLC Board as a non-executive director. Edwards and Watkins were the only two directors who served both on the Football Board and the PLC Board. At the [[Annual General Meeting|AGM]] in 2005 [[Malcolm Glazer]] opposed Watkins' re-election to the PLC board along with two other directors [[Philip Yea]] a fellow non-executive director and Andy Anson. After Malcolm Glazer had completed his takeover of Manchester United he de-listed it from the stock exchanged and made it a private company once again. Watkins remains on the club's football board and is the club's lawyer.

Watkins has overseen numerous high-profile [[association football|football]] transfers both at home in the [[United Kingdom]] and abroad. He has also represented clubs and players before [[FIFA]], [[UEFA]], [[the Football Association]], the [[Premier League]] and [[the Football League]] disciplinary bodies. Also he has represented players and clubs at the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] and international and league compensation tribunals. He has worked with the [[South Africa]] and [[Nigerian]] Premier leagues in respect of broadcasting and regulatory matters as well as the Egyptian Sports Council and UAE footballing authorities.

Watkins regularly speaks on football and sports law issues within the United Kingdom and internationally. He has represented both [[the Football Association]] and the [[Premier League]] at conferences in [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[Qatar]], [[Spain]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Japan]].

In 2012 Watkins was named interim [[Rugby Football League]] Chairman when [[Richard Lewis (tennis and rugby league)|Richard Lewis]]' moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past RFL Presidents|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/the-rfl/history_and_heritage/past_rfl_presidents|work=therfl.co.uk|publisher=[[Rugby Football League]]|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2012, Watkins stepped down from the board of Manchester United Football Club Ltd after 28 years with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2012/Jun/maurice-watkins-to-leave-manchester-united-board.aspx|title=Director leaves United board|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Manchester United|work=ManUtd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2013 it was announced that Watkins would become chairman of Championship football club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/news/article/maurice-watkins-set-for-chairman-role-30052013-846222.aspx|title=Maurice Watkins CBE steps back into football to become chairman of Barnsley Football Club|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=30 May 2013|publisher=Barnsley FC|work=barnsleyfc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:meca.jpg|thumb|170px|&lt;center&gt;David Meca&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Meca-Medina ruling''', known officially as David Meca-Medina and Igor Majcen v Commission of the European Communities,&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62004J0519:EN:HTML|title=The requested document does not exist. – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asser.nl/default.aspx?site_id=11&amp;level1=13910&amp;level2=13974&amp;level3=&amp;textid=35944|title=T.M.C. Asser Instituut – International Sports Law Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[European Court of Justice]] that established primacy of [[EU law]] over [[Sport governing body|sports federations]]. The ruling concerned [[David Meca-Medina]] and [[Igor Majcen]], long distance swimmers from Spain and [[Slovenia]] and their failed drugs test. The case was wide-reaching and important because it established the scope and nature that individual laws by sporting regulators, league operators and individual associations in Europe could impose their own rules and if they were in direct conflict with EU treaties, acquis or judgements by the European Courts of Justice.

==Background==

===Walrave and Koch===
Before 2006, sport in Europe had what was called a ''sporting exception''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/eslj/issues/volume5/number2/miettinen_parrish/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014120533/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/eslj/issues/volume5/number2/miettinen_parrish/ |archivedate=14 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the case of two Dutch cyclists in Walrave and Koch (Walrave and Koch v Association Union Cycliste Internationale) at the European Court of Justice in 1974 which was ruling whether organisations (such as the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] in this case) could be held to the same discrimination rules as member states. It was clear from Treaty provisions 7 (the prohibition on nationality-based discrimination), 48 (presumption of free movement of (employed) workers) and 59 (presumption of free movement of (self-employed) workers) that no EEC member state could discriminate in this way but it was untested in European courts whether a regulatory or sanctioning organisation could be held to the same rules.

The European Courts of Justice stated that its rules for member states did not apply to an organisation that sanctioned and regulated a certain sport because the rules were essentially made for EU economic activity and as these were rules consisting of a purely sporting character, were not subject to Community law, even if they restrained the economic freedom of certain professional or semi-professional athletes.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=61974J0036&amp;model=guichett|title=EUR-Lex – 61974CJ0036 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: ''These Community provisions on freedom of movement for persons and freedom to provide services not only apply to the action of public authorities but extend also to rules of any other nature aimed at regulating gainful employment and the provision of services in a collective manner. However, the prohibitions enacted by these provisions of the Treaty do not affect rules concerning questions which are of purely sporting interest and, as such, have nothing to do with economic activity.''

:: ''The general objective of anti-doping rules relating to sport is to combat doping in order for competitive sport to be conducted fairly and includes the need to safeguard equal chances for athletes, athletes' health, the integrity and objectivity of competitive sport and ethical values in sport. In addition, given that penalties are necessary to ensure enforcement of the doping ban, their effect on athletes' freedom of action must be considered to be, in principle, inherent itself in the anti-doping rules.''

:: ''Since, moreover, working conditions in the various Member States are governed by means of provisions laid down in law or regulations and sometimes by agreements and other acts concluded by private persons, to limit the prohibitions in question to acts of a public authority would risk creating inequality in their application.''

This ruling states that European law only applies to "economic activities" within the overall meaning of Article 2 of the Treaty. In Walrave, the Court held that EU law did not apply to rules governing the composition of national sports teams and it was not for the ECJ to assess whether or not such rules were disproportionate. This in effect meant that regulators in sport could continue regulating in a way that they felt best without adhering to certain rules by the EU.

===The Bosman ruling===
''For more information see [[Bosman ruling]]''

One of the first challenges to the Walrave and Koch ruling was by the [[Belgian]] footballer [[Jean-Marc Bosman]]. Bosman was a [[midfielder]] who joined [[Standard Liege]] in 1983. After failing to establish himself there and [[RFC Liege]] his contract expired in 1990. [[USL Dunkerque|Dunkerque]] wanted to sign him but would not meet RFCL's fee, the Belgian club then cut Bosman's pay by 75%. Bosman's lawyers including [[Jean-Louis Dupont]] sued club, Belgian FA and [[UEFA]] for [[restraint of trade]] and in December 1995 the EU court said out-of-contract players can move on free transfers and banned limits on number of foreign EU players under the EU Restraint of Trade law.

Although Bosman's victory was [[pyrrhic]] ending in alcoholism and incarceration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/407361/Jean-Marc-Bosman-s-jail-ruling|title=Jean-Marc Bosman's jail ruling|first=Matthew|last=Dunn|date=13 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the effect it had was it reversed parts of the Walrave and Koch ruling namely that contractual restrictions on freedom to conduct business could not be an exception.
Since Bosman, other cases have been brought to the ECJ like Deliège&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996CJ0051:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt; which has weakened the sporting exception further.

==David Meca-Medina and Igor Majcen==
[[David Meca-Medina]] and [[Igor Majcen]] were long distance swimmers from Spain and [[Slovenia]] respectively who after
finishing first and second in a World Cup race in Brazil both had positive anti-doping test for [[Nandrolone]], prohibited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-Prohibited-list/2013/WADA-Prohibited-List-2013-EN.pdf|title=Ressources|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116073724/http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-Prohibited-list/2013/WADA-Prohibited-List-2013-EN.pdf|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anabolic steroid]] and were banned for a period of four years by a decision of [[FINA]]'s Doping Panel of 8 August 1999. Meca-Medina and Majcen then appealed the decision before the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], which confirmed the suspension on 29 February 2000 before reconsidering it and subsequently reducing it to a period of two years.

===The EEC and the EU===

The 1974 ruling of Walrave was made in a different version of the EU. The [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] or "Common Market" as it was known and its scope was far narrower than the EU is today. It was primarily an economic tool and had as its aim the economic union of its member nations. When the [[Maastricht Treaty]] was signed in 1993 the aims of the supranational organisation was enlarged and incorporated other institutions like the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Central Bank]], and the [[European Parliament]]. This was enough to convince the court that previous cases based on Walrave could be modified or supplanted.

==The case==
Meca-Medina and Majcen (also represented by Jean-Louis DUPONT) subsequently filed a case against the executive body of the [[European Union]], the [[European Commission]], that the rules adopted by the [[International Olympic Committee]] concerning doping control were incompatible with the EC rules on competition and freedom to provide services.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt; As the rules at the time stated, European law mostly (apart from the above Bosman and Deliège cases) only applied to economic activities within Article 2 of the Treaty.&lt;ref name="uefa.org"&gt;http://www.uefa.org/MultimediaFiles/Download/uefa/KeyTopics/480391_DOWNLOAD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2001, the appellants filed a complaint with the Commission, stating that anti-doping rules breached articles 49, 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Article 82 states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/legislation/treaties/ec/art82_en.html|title=EU/Competition/Article 82 of the EC Treaty (ex Article 86)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market insofar as it may affect trade between Member States.''

They argued that the fixing of the limit for Nandrolone at two nanogrammes per millilitre of urine was a concerted practice between the IOC and the 27 laboratories accredited by it and that the anti-competitive nature of that practice was reinforced by the fact that the tribunals responsible for the settlement of sports disputes by arbitration were not independent of the IOC.&lt;ref name="asser.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asser.nl/default.aspx?site_id=11&amp;level1=13911&amp;level2=13934|title=T.M.C. Asser Instituut – International Sports Law Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECJ Court of First Instance disagreed and held that doping was a sporting not an economic issue. The judgement was appealed and the appellate court held that the court of First Instance had erred in law when it held that the anti-doping rules at issue did not fall within the scope of Articles 49, 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt; Secondly, they disputed the assessment made by the Court of First Instance according to which anti-doping rules are purely sporting rules and therefore fall outside the scope of the EC Treaty.&lt;ref name="asser.nl"/&gt; This essentially said that activity that takes the form of paid employment for professional or semi-professional sportsmen was covered under law in the treaty.

==Repercussions==
Before Meca-Medina a sporting rule which had an economic effect was immune from challenge merely because it was a sporting rule. Currently, any sporting rule which restricts competition will need to be shown to have effects no more far reaching than its immediate objectives. It is significant for its departure from previous sports law because cases are decided on a case-by-case basis and reflects that Europe's sporting bodies have economic effects and are open to scrutiny by the competition authorities. Although, if sporting bodies can illustrate that the objectives pursued by its rules are legitimate and proportionate in their effects then the ruling should have no effect.

Although it is seen in a positive light by many for the above reasons, some have disagreed. UEFA stated ''"Without question, the final judgment is unsatisfactory..."''&lt;ref name="uefa.org"/&gt; And continued suggesting that the EU may have opened floodgates to more cases in the future:

::''Encouraged by the judgment in Meca-Medina, it is to be expected that complainants will now amplify arguments to the effect that sports rules and practices have "disproportionate" effects or are "not limited to what is necessary for the proper conduct of competitive sport" and, in this way, "prove" a violation of competition law. It seems the European Court of Justice (unlike the CFI) has now declared its interest and willingness to examine all manner of such arguments in the future. The European Commission may also have a harder job in rejecting vexatious claims under competition law.''

[[File:HerbBrooksArena.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Herb Brooks Arena in the Olympic Center at Lake Placid, New York hosted the match]]

The "'''Miracle on Ice'''" was a medal-round game during the men's [[ice hockey]] [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|tournament]] at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]], played between the hosting [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]] and the four-time defending gold medalists, the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]].

The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more in Lake Placid. The team consisted primarily of professional players with significant experience in international play. By contrast, the United States' team—led by head coach [[Herb Brooks]]—consisted exclusively of [[amateur]] players, and was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and U.S. teams were unbeaten; the U.S. achieved several notable results, including a 2–2 draw against Sweden, and a 7–3 upset victory over second-place favorites [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]].

For the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2–2, and the Soviets leading 3–2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4–3. Following the game, the U.S. went on to clinch the gold medal by beating [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] in the final. Likewise, the Soviet Union took the silver medal&lt;!--Please do not change to Bronze. the USSR won Silver it was a round robin medal round--&gt; by beating [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]].

The victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports. Equally well-known was the television call of the final seconds of the game by [[Al Michaels]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]], in which he declared: "Do you believe in miracles?! YES!" In 1999, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the "Miracle on Ice" the top sports moment of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/cover/news/1999/12/02/awards/ |title= The 20th Century Awards: Sports Illustrated honors world's greatest athletes |work= [[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate= June 11, 2011 |date= December 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its centennial celebration in 2008, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) named the "Miracle on Ice" as the best international ice hockey story of the past 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/top-story-of-the-century.html |title= Top Story of the Century |publisher= International Ice Hockey Federation |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The Soviet and American teams===
[[File:Vladislav Tretiak.JPG|alt=Shoulder high portrait of smiling man wearing a suit and tie|thumb|upright|The Soviet team's Vladislav Tretiak (pictured here in 2008) was considered the best goaltender in ice hockey in 1980. The Americans scored two goals against him before he was pulled from the game at the end of the first period.]]
The Soviet Union entered the Lake Placid games as the heavy favorite, having won the previous four ice hockey gold medals dating back to the [[Ice hockey at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] games. In the four Olympics following their [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] bronze medal finish at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], Soviet teams had gone 27–1–1 (wins-losses-ties) and outscored their opponents 175–44.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; In head-to-head match-ups against the United States, the cumulative score over that period was 28–7.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets were well-seasoned "amateurs" who were employed by industrial firms or military organizations for the sole purpose of playing hockey on their organization's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|title=PROTESTING AMATEUR RULES, CANADA LEAVES INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY|author=IIHF|date=2008|publisher=IIHF.com|accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt; They were led by legendary players in world ice hockey, such as [[Boris Mikhailov (ice hockey)|Boris Mikhailov]] (a top line [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] and team captain), [[Vladislav Tretiak]] (the consensus best goaltender in the world at the time), the speedy and skilled [[Valeri Kharlamov]], as well as talented, young, and dynamic players such as defenseman [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and forwards [[Vladimir Krutov]] and [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]]. From that team, Tretiak, Kharlamov, Makarov, and Fetisov would eventually be enshrined in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. Many of the Soviet players had gained attention in the [[Summit Series]] eight years before and, in contrast to the American players, were de facto professionals with long histories of international play.&lt;ref&gt;Podnieks, ''Andrew: Team Canada 1972: The Official 40th Anniversary Celebration of the Summit Series'' {{ISBN|978-0771071195}} p.212&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. head coach Herb Brooks had tryouts in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in the summer of 1979. Of the 20 players who eventually made the final Olympic roster, [[Buzz Schneider]] was the only one returning from the [[Ice hockey at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976]] Olympic team.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Nine players had played under Brooks at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|University of Minnesota]], which included [[Rob McClanahan]], [[Mike Ramsey (ice hockey)|Mike Ramsey]], and [[Phil Verchota]]; while four more were from [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]]: [[Dave Silk]], [[Jack O'Callahan]], goalie [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]], and team captain [[Mike Eruzione]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; Boston University and Minnesota were perennial rivals in college hockey and the hostility carried over from some of the players on the Olympic team for the first few months. But part of Brooks' selection process was a 300-question psychological test that would give him insight on how every player would react under stress. Anyone who refused to take the test would be flunked. Brooks had to select from 68 players who started the tryout.&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Reminder Of What We Can Be|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1980/12/22/106775781/a-reminder-of-what-we-can-be|publisher=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average age of the U.S. team was 21 years old, making it the youngest team in U.S. team history to play in the Olympics. It would be the youngest team in the Olympic tournament. But Brooks had selected carefully and knew the limits of every player. As forward John Harrington said, "He knew exactly where to quit. He'd push you right to the limit where you were ready to say, 'I've had it, I'm throwing it in'—and then he'd back off." Brooks continued the organization by campaigning for the players' selection of Eruzione as the captain, and Craig had been the goalie for him in the 1979 World Championship tournament.&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be" /&gt; Assistant coach [[Craig Patrick]] had played with Brooks on the 1967 U.S. national team.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet and American teams were natural rivals due to the decades-old [[Cold War]]. In addition, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] was at the time considering a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]], to be held in [[Moscow]], in protest of the December 1979 [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. On February 9, the same day the American and Soviet teams met in an exhibition game in [[New York City]], U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cyrus Vance]] denounced the impending [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow games]] at a meeting of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–160&lt;/ref&gt; President Carter eventually decided in favor of the boycott.

===Exhibitions===
[[File:Mark Johnson at 2010 Winter Olympics 2010-02-25.jpg|alt=Face of a man speaking into a microphone|thumb|upright|Mark Johnson's goal in the last second of the first period tied the game]]
In exhibitions that year, Soviet club teams went 5–3–1 against [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) teams, and a year earlier, the Soviet national team had routed the NHL All-Stars 6–0 to win the [[1979 Challenge Cup (ice hockey)|Challenge Cup]].&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news |first= Kevin |last= Allen |date= December 23, 1997 |url= http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html |title= College kids perform Olympic miracle |publisher= [[ESPN]] |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979–80, virtually all the top North American players were Canadians, although the number of U.S.-born professional players had been on the rise throughout the 1970s. The 1980 U.S. Olympic team featured several young players who were regarded as highly promising, and some had signed contracts to play in the NHL immediately after the tournament.

In September 1979, before the Olympics, the American team started exhibition play. They played a total of 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and America.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt; Through these games, Herb Brooks instilled a European style of play in the American team, emphasizing wide open play with sufficient body contact. He believed it would be the only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Green |last=Ted |title='We Aren't Awed' Please...Nobody Tell the U.S. Hockey Team It Has No Chance |date=2 February 1980 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the start of the exhibitions, he conducted the team through skating windsprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and back. Some of the players took to calling these Herbies.&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be" /&gt; On September 17, 1979, the team played to a 3-3 tie in Norway.&lt;ref name="1980 Pre Olympic Tour Schedule"&gt;{{cite web|title=1980 Pre Olympic Tour Schedule|url=http://history.vintagemnhockey.com/page/show/1166356-1980-pre-olympic-tour-schedule-results|publisher=Vintage Minnesota Hockey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game, and after a while, the lights were turned off by custodians and the practice continued in the dark. Near the end of the exhibition season, although he had supported them throughout, Brooks threatened because of subpar play to cut Eruzione (the captain) and replace Craig as the starting goalie with [[Steve Janaszak]].&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be" /&gt;

In the last exhibition game against the Soviets at [[Madison Square Garden]] on February 9, 1980, the Soviets crushed the Americans 10–3.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–48&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet head coach [[Viktor Tikhonov (ice hockey, born 1930)|Viktor Tikhonov]] later said that this victory "turned out to be a very big problem" by causing the Soviets to underestimate the American team.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also costly for the Americans off-ice, as defenseman [[Jack O'Callahan]] pulled a ligament in his knee; however, Brooks kept O'Callahan on the roster which meant virtually playing with only 19 players throughout the tournament. O'Callahan would eventually return for the game against the Soviets playing limited minutes.

===Olympic group play===
In Olympic group play, the Americans surprised many observers with their physical, cohesive play. In their first game against favored [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]], Team USA earned a dramatic 2–2 draw by scoring with 27 seconds left after pulling goalie [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]] for an extra attacker. Had Team USA not scored this goal and all other results remained the same, the Soviet Union would have emerged with the gold medal on goal differential over the U.S. in the medal round. Then came a stunning 7–3 victory over [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], who were a favorite for the silver medal. With its two toughest games in the group phase out of the way, the U.S. team reeled off three more wins, beating [[Norway men's national ice hockey team|Norway]] 5–1, [[Romania men's national ice hockey team|Romania]] 7–2, and [[West Germany national ice hockey team|West Germany]] 4–2 to go 4–0–1 and advance to the medal round from its group, along with Sweden.

In the other group, the Soviets stormed through their opposition undefeated, often by grossly lopsided scores. They defeated [[Japan men's national ice hockey team|Japan]] 16–0, the [[Netherlands men's national ice hockey team|Netherlands]] 17–4, [[Poland men's national ice hockey team|Poland]] 8–1, [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] 4–2, and [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]] 6–4 to easily qualify for the next round, although both the Finns and the Canadians gave the Soviets tough games for two periods. In the end, the Soviet Union and Finland advanced from their group.&lt;ref name=boxscore&gt;{{cite book |author= Lake Placid Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games |url= http://www.la84foundation.com/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/orw1980v2.pdf| title= Official Results of the XIII Olympic Winter Games—Lake Placid 1980 |format= PDF |publisher= Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles |year= 1985 |pages= 105–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- See this PDF file for all official game information, including won-loss records, game outcomes, information on qualifying and advancing, etc. --&gt;

==Game summary==
Prior to the game, [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] requested that it be rescheduled from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] so that it could be broadcast live in [[primetime]] hours. However, the request was declined by the IIHF after the Soviets complained that it would cause the game to air at 4 a.m. [[Moscow Time]], as opposed to 1 a.m. Moscow Time. As a result, ABC decided not to broadcast the game live for the U.S. audience and instead [[broadcast delay|tape delayed]] it for broadcast during its primetime block of Olympics coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = ABC-TV Unable To Offer Key Hockey Playoff Live: Federation Rejected Request|last = Shepard|first = Richard F.|date = Feb 23, 1980 |access-date = |work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game aired, ABC's Olympics host [[Jim McKay]] openly stated that the game had already occurred but that they had promised not to spoil its results. In order to accommodate coverage of the men's slalom competition, portions of the game were also edited for time.&lt;ref name="nyt-different"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV SPORTS; 'Miracle on Ice' of 1980 Looks Different Today|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/22/sports/tv-sports-miracle-on-ice-of-1980-looks-different-today.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day some of the people who watched the game on television still believe that it was live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.si.com/more-sports/2010/02/22/miracle-onice |title=10 interesting facts you may not know about the Miracle on Ice |first= Joe |last= Posnanski |work= Sports Illustrated |date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a capacity of 8,500, the Field House was packed.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; The home crowd waved [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flags]] and sang patriotic songs such as "[[God Bless America]]".&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out on a piece of paper, telling them that "You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours."&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks believed they could win and later said, "The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. But we had to get to the point to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, 'It's meant to be. This is your moment and it's going to happen.' It's kind of corny and I could see them thinking, 'Here goes Herb again....' But I believed it."&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be" /&gt;

===First period===
As in several previous games, the U.S. team fell behind early. [[Vladimir Krutov]] deflected a slap shot by [[Alexei Kasatonov]] past U.S. goaltender Jim Craig at the 9:12 mark to give the Soviets a 1–0 lead, and after [[Buzz Schneider]] scored for the United States on a 50-foot shot from the left boards at 14:03 to tie the game,&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be" /&gt; the Soviets struck again with a [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]] goal with 17:34 gone. With his team down 2–1, Craig improved his play, turning away many Soviet shots before the U.S. team had another shot on goal (the Soviet team had 39&amp;nbsp;shots on goal in the game, the Americans 16).

In the waning seconds of the first period, [[Dave Christian]] fired a slap shot on Tretiak from {{convert|100|ft|m}} away. The Soviet goalie saved the shot but misplayed the [[Rebound (sports)|rebound]], which bounced out some {{convert|20|ft|m}} in front of him. [[Mark Johnson (hockey player)|Mark Johnson]] sliced between the two defenders, found the loose puck, and fired it past a diving Tretiak to tie the score with one second left in the period. This would be an important judgment call by the officials, as an official announcement confirming the goal did not come until many Soviet players were
off the ice and heading to the locker room for intermission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2010/02/22/miracle-onice |title=10 interesting facts you may not know about the Miracle on Ice |first= Joe |last= Posnanski |work= Sports Illustrated |date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first period ended with the game tied 2–2.&lt;ref name=swift&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/the_golden_goal/ |title= The Golden Goal |first= E.M. |last= Swift |work= [[Sports Illustrated]] |date= March 3, 1980 |accessdate= April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second period===
Tikhonov replaced Tretiak with backup goaltender [[Vladimir Myshkin]] immediately after Johnson's tying goal,&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; a move that shocked players on both teams.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; Tikhonov later identified this as the "turning point of the game",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Jamie |last= Fitzpatrick |url= http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/miracle_on_ice_2.htm |title= The Miracle Unfolds |work= About.com |publisher= The New York Times Co. |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called it "the biggest mistake of my career".&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;152&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, when Johnson asked [[Viacheslav Fetisov]], now an NHL teammate, about the move, Fetisov responded with "Coach crazy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/miracle_on_ice_2.htm|title=Pro Hockey About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myshkin allowed no goals in the second period. The Soviets dominated play in the second period, outshooting the Americans 12–2, but scored only once, on a [[power play (sport)|power play]] goal by [[Aleksandr Maltsev]] 2:18 into play. After two periods the Soviet Union led 3–2.

===Third period===
Vladimir Krutov was sent to the [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty box]] at the 6:47 mark of the third period for [[high-sticking]]. The Americans, who had managed only two shots on Myshkin in 27&amp;nbsp;minutes, had a power play and a rare offensive opportunity. Myshkin stopped a [[Mike Ramsey (ice hockey)|Mike Ramsey]] shot, then U.S. team captain [[Mike Eruzione]] fired a shot wide. Late in the power play, [[Dave Silk]] was advancing into the Soviet zone when [[Valeri Vasiliev]] knocked him to the ice. The puck slid to Mark Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, pp.&amp;nbsp;350–52&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson fired off a shot that went under Myshkin and into the net at the 8:39 mark, as the power play was ending, tying the game at 3.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;358&lt;/ref&gt; Only a couple of shifts later, [[Mark Pavelich]] passed to Eruzione, who was left undefended in the high [[Slot (ice hockey)|slot]]. Eruzione, who had just come onto the ice, fired a shot past Myshkin, who was [[Screen (ice hockey)|screened]] by [[Vasili Pervukhin]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;374&lt;/ref&gt; This goal gave Team USA a 4–3 lead, its first of the game, with exactly 10&amp;nbsp;minutes remaining to play.

The Soviets, trailing for the first time in the game, attacked ferociously. Moments after Eruzione's goal, Maltsev fired a shot which ricocheted off the right goal post.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;377&lt;/ref&gt; As the minutes wound down, Brooks kept repeating to his players, "Play your game. Play your game."&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;379&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of going into a defensive crouch, the United States continued to play offense, even getting off a few more shots on goal.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;381&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets began to shoot wildly, and [[Sergei Starikov]] admitted that "we were panicking". As the clock ticked down below a minute, the Soviets got the puck back into the American zone, and Mikhailov passed to [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Petrov|Vladimir Petrov]], who shot wide.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;383&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets never pulled Myshkin for an [[extra attacker]], much to the Americans' disbelief. Starikov later explained that "We never did six-on-five", not even in practice, because "Tikhonov just didn't believe in it".&lt;ref name="Coffey, p. 384"&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;384&lt;/ref&gt; Craig kicked away a Petrov slap shot with 33&amp;nbsp;seconds left. Kharlamov fired the puck back in as the clock ticked below 20&amp;nbsp;seconds. A wild scramble for the puck ensued, ending when Johnson found it and passed it to Ken Morrow.&lt;ref name="Coffey, p. 384"/&gt; As the U.S. team tried to clear the zone (move the puck over the blue line, which they did with seven seconds remaining), the crowd began to count down the seconds left. Sportscaster [[Al Michaels]], who was calling the game on [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] along with former [[Montreal Canadiens]] goalie [[Ken Dryden]], picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call:&lt;ref name=documentary&gt;{{cite book |author= HBO Sports |title= Do You Believe in Miracles? : The Story of the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team |location= New York |publisher= HBO Home Video |type= Video |year= 2001 |isbn= 9780783119953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his team ran all over the ice in celebration, Herb Brooks sprinted back to the locker room and cried.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;387&lt;/ref&gt; In the locker room afterwards, players spontaneously broke into a chorus of "God Bless America" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bacon |first= John U. |url= http://annarborchronicle.com/2010/02/19/column-oh-say-can-you-see-a-new-anthem/ |title= Oh, Say Can You See a New Anthem? |work= Ann Arbor Chronicle |date= February 20, 2010 |accessdate= April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a congratulatory phone call from President [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Carter phones U.S. Olympic hockey team|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0zzKYwjNw0|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the broadcast wrap-up after the game, ABC Olympic sports anchor Jim McKay compared the American victory over the Soviet professionals to a group of Canadian [[college football]] players defeating the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (the recent [[Super Bowl XIV|Super Bowl]] champions and at the height of their [[Dynasty (sports)|dynasty]]).

==American aftermath==
===Gold medal===
[[File:Jim Craig Equipment.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Jim Craig's gear from 1980, at the Hockey Hall of Fame]]
The United States did not immediately win the gold medal upon defeating the USSR. In 1980, the medal round was a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]], not a single elimination format as it is today. Under Olympic rules at the time, the group game with Sweden was counted along with the medal round games versus the Soviet Union and Finland so it was mathematically possible for the United States to finish anywhere from first to fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Swift |first= E.M. |date= March 3, 1980 |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/the_golden_goal/ |title= The Golden Goal |work= Sports Illustrated }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needing to win to secure the gold medal, Team USA came back from a 2–1 third period deficit to defeat Finland 4–2.&lt;ref name=boxscore/&gt; According to Mike Eruzione, coming into the dressing room in the second intermission, Brooks turned to his players, looked at them and said, "If you lose this game, you'll take it to your fucking graves." He then walked towards the locker room door, paused and looked over his shoulder and said to us again "Your fucking graves"."

At the time, the players ascended a podium to receive their medals and then lined up on the ice for the playing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]], as the podium was only meant to accommodate one person. Only the team captains remained on the podium for the duration. After the completion of the anthem, Eruzione motioned for his teammates to join him on the podium.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, pp.&amp;nbsp;412–13&lt;/ref&gt; Today, podiums are not used for ice hockey; the teams line up on their respective bluelines after the final game.

The cover of the March 3, 1980, issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' was a photograph by [[Heinz Kluetmeier]] of the American players celebrating and waving an American flag; it did not feature any explanatory captions or headlines, because, as Kluetmeier put it, "It didn't need it. Everyone in America knew what happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/writers/richard_deitsch/08/19/heinz.qanda/1.html |title=Heinz Q&amp;A |first= Richard |last= Deitsch |work= Sports Illustrated |date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. team also received the magazine's "[[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]]" award,&lt;ref name="A Reminder Of What We Can Be" /&gt; as well as being named as Athlete of the Year by the [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Associated Press]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''. In 2004, [[ESPN]], as part of its [[ESPN25|25th anniversary]], declared the Miracle on Ice to be the top sports headline moment, and game of the period 1979–2004. The victory was voted the greatest sports moment of the 20th century by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sptimes.com/2005/02/22/news_pf/Sports/The_anniversary_of_a_.shtml |title= The anniversary of a Miracle |date= February 22, 2005 |work= St. Petersburg Times |accessdate= May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1980 Winter Olympics===
At the [[1981 Canada Cup]], the United States, with seven players from their 1980 Olympic team, again faced the Soviet Union. The Soviets took the opening round encounter 4–1 in [[Edmonton]]. At the [[1982 World Ice Hockey Championships|1982 World Championship in Finland]], with [[Mike Ramsey (ice hockey)|Mike Ramsey]], [[Mark Johnson (ice hockey)|Mark Johnson]], [[Buzz Schneider]], and [[John Harrington (ice hockey)|John Harrington]], the Americans again met the Soviets, but once again the U.S. lost, 8–4.

===Later careers===
Of the 20&amp;nbsp;players on Team USA, 13&amp;nbsp;eventually played in the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;318&lt;/ref&gt; Five of them went on to play over 500&amp;nbsp;NHL games, and three would play over 1,000 NHL games.

*[[Neal Broten]] played one more season for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|Golden Gophers]] before moving on to the NHL, and appeared in 1,099 NHL games over 17 seasons, with 992 of them being with the [[Minnesota North Stars]]/[[Dallas Stars]] franchise. He captained the Stars before being traded midway through the 1994–95 season to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. A two-time All-Star, he tallied 923 career points (289 goals, 634 assists), became the first American player to record 100 points in a season, and won a [[Stanley Cup]] as a member of the Devils in [[1994–95 NHL season|1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/b/brotene01.html |title= Neal Broten |work= Hockey Reference |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broten had already won the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA championship]] in 1979 at the [[University of Minnesota]]; this, combined with the Olympic gold medal in 1980 and the 1995 Cup win (Broten scored the Cup-winning goal in Game 4 as [[Viacheslav Fetisov]], playing for the Red Wings, fell down), made him the first player in the history of the sport to win a championship at the collegiate, professional, and Olympic levels. The Dallas Stars have since retired number&amp;nbsp;7 for Broten.
*[[Ken Morrow]] won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1980 Stanley Cup Finals|1980]] as a member of the [[New York Islanders]], becoming the first hockey player to win an Olympic gold medal and the Cup in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play 550 NHL games and win three more Cups, all with the Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/morroke01.html |title= Ken Morrow |work= Hockey Reference |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow later worked for the Islanders as Director of Pro Scouting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://islanders.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43588 |title= Ken Morrow, Director of Pro Scouting |accessdate= February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mike Ramsey (ice hockey)|Mike Ramsey]] played in 1,070 games over 18 years. Fourteen of those years were spent with the [[Buffalo Sabres]], with whom he played 911 games and was a five-time All-Star, captaining the team from 1990 to 1992. In 1995, he played in the [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] while with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], but got swept by Neal Broten and the New Jersey Devils. In 2000, Ramsey became an assistant coach for the [[Minnesota Wild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=4450 |title= Mike Ramsey |work= Hockey Database |publisher= Hockeydb.com |accessdate= May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dave Christian]] spent 14 years in the NHL, the bulk of them for the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|original Winnipeg Jets]] (for whom he served as team captain) and [[Washington Capitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/c/chrisda01.html |title= Dave Christian |work= Hockey Reference |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he played in the [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] while on the [[Boston Bruins]], but lost in five games to the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. He ended his career with 783 points (340 goals, 443 assists) in 1,009 games and made the All-Star team in [[1990–91 NHL season|1991]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=973 |title= Dave Christian |work= Hockey Database |publisher= Hockeydb.com |accessdate= May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mark Johnson (hockey player)|Mark Johnson]] played for several teams in the NHL before finding a home in New Jersey, tallying 508 career points (203 goals, 305 assists) in 669 games over 11&amp;nbsp;seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=7848 |title= Mark Johnson (ice hockey) |work= Hockey Database |publisher= Hockeydb.com |accessdate= May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Christian, Ramsey, and Broten, he became an NHL All-Star (in [[1983–84 NHL season|1984]]) and served as team captain with the [[Hartford Whalers]]. In 2002 Johnson became the coach of the [[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|University of Wisconsin–Madison women's team]], leading the Badgers to [[NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Championship|National Championships]] in 2006, 2007 (which the Badgers won in the same Lake Placid arena where the Miracle took place), 2009, and 2011. Johnson also served as head coach of the women's ice hockey team that won the silver medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Women's tournament|2010 Winter Olympics]].
*[[Jack O'Callahan]] played 390 NHL regular season games between 1982 and 1989 for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and New Jersey Devils.
*[[Mark Pavelich]] played 355 NHL regular season games in the NHL for the [[New York Rangers]], Minnesota North Stars, and [[San Jose Sharks]] between 1981 and 1992.
*[[Dave Silk]] played 249 NHL regular season games for the Boston Bruins, Winnipeg Jets, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers between 1980 and 1985.
[[File:Al Michaels.jpg|alt=Knee high portrait of a man wearing khaki colored clothes and wearing a baseball hat|thumb|upright|The Miracle on Ice launched the professional careers of several players, and made broadcaster [[Al Michaels]] famous.]]
*[[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]] appeared in 30&amp;nbsp;NHL games for the [[Atlanta Flames]], Boston Bruins, and Minnesota North Stars between 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/c/craigji01.html |title= Jim Craig |work= Hockey Reference |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Team captain [[Mike Eruzione]] did not play any high-level ice hockey after the 1980 Olympics, as he felt that he had accomplished all of his hockey goals with the gold medal win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=11IfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LNIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2023,973273&amp;dq=mike+eruzione&amp;hl=en |title= Eruzione Won't Go Pro |agency= [[Associated Press]] |work= [[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]] |date= March 1, 1980 |accessdate= May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did work as a hockey television analyst in the 1980s and 1990s.
*[[Craig Patrick]], Brooks' assistant coach and assistant general manager, went on to both manage and coach the New York Rangers and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. As a result of his success with the Penguins, who won two [[Stanley Cup]]s while Patrick was general manager (GM), he was enshrined in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 2002. During that same year, he also served as GM to the Brooks-coached [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|2002 U.S. hockey team]] that won the silver medal at the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City]] games.
*[[Herb Brooks]], the team coach, coached several NHL teams following the Olympics, with mixed results. He returned to the Olympics as coach of the [[France national ice hockey team|French team]] in [[ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]], the first Olympics in which NHL professionals competed. Brooks then led Team USA to the silver medal in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], which included a 2–2 round robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final victory over Russia (the successor to the Soviet Union), the semi-final match coming 22 years to the day after the "Miracle on Ice" game.&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/22/usa_russia_ap/ | work=CNN | title=USA holds off Russia 3–2 to advance to gold medal game | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks died in a car crash near [[Forest Lake, Minnesota|Forest Lake]], Minnesota on August 11, 2003 at the age of 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2003/08/11/brooks_obit_ap/ |title= Herb Brooks killed in car accident |work= Sports Illustrated |date= August 11, 2003 |accessdate= May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Olympic Center ice arena in Lake Placid where the Miracle on Ice took place was renamed [[Herb Brooks Arena|in his honor]].
*[[Al Michaels]] got the job as play-by-play announcer for ice hockey at Lake Placid because he was the only member of ABC's broadcasting team who had previously called the sport (at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo, Japan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cleveland.com/olympics/index.ssf/2010/02/miracle_on_ice_announcer_al_mi.html |title= 'Miracle on Ice' announcer Al Michaels is back in the Olympic studio |first= Richard |last= Sandomir |agency= Associated Press |date= February 22, 2010 |work= [[The Plain Dealer]] |location= Cleveland, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels was named "Sportscaster of the Year" in 1980 for his coverage of the event.

==Soviet aftermath==
===Silver medal===
In the Soviet locker room, Tikhonov singled out first-line players Tretiak, Kharlamov, Petrov, and Mikhailov, and told each of them, "This is your loss!"&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;389&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the Miracle on Ice, the Soviet team defeated Sweden 9–2, winning the silver medal.&lt;!--Please do not change to Bronze. The USSR won Silver it was a round robin medal round--&gt; The Soviet players were so upset at their loss that they did not turn in their silver medals to get their names inscribed on them, as is custom.&lt;ref name=Coffey413&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;413&lt;/ref&gt; The result stunned the Soviet Union and its news media.

===After 1980 Winter Olympics===
Despite the loss, the USSR remained the pre-eminent power in Olympic hockey until its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|1991 break-up]]. The Soviet team did not lose a World Championship game until 1985 and did not lose to the United States again until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, pp.&amp;nbsp;396–97&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, NHL teams continued to draft Soviet players in hopes of enticing them to eventually play in North America. Soviet emigrant [[Victor Nechayev]] made a brief appearance with the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in the [[1982–83 NHL season|1982–83 season]], and during the [[1988–89 NHL season|1988–89 season]], the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation agreed to let veteran [[Sergei Pryakhin]] join the [[Calgary Flames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/27/soviet_legacy/ |title= Sweeping changes: Russian hockey looked different after '72 Summit Series |work= Sports Illustrated |date= September 27, 2002 |accessdate= 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989-90, six 1980 Soviet Olympians joined Pryakhin on NHL rosters (see below). Also that year, young Soviet star winger [[Alexander Mogilny]] defected to play for the [[Buffalo Sabres]], followed the next year by his linemate, center [[Sergei Fedorov]], who defected to play for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Then, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a flood of ex-Soviet stars joined the NHL, including winger [[Pavel Bure]] (Mogilny and Fedorov's linemate) and defenseman [[Vladimir Konstantinov]]. Since then, many of the NHL's top players have come from the [[post-Soviet states]].

In the [[1989–90 NHL season|1989-90 season]], six 1980 Soviet Olympians &amp;ndash; [[Helmuts Balderis]], [[Viacheslav Fetisov]], [[Alexei Kasatonov]], [[Vladimir Krutov]], [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]], and [[Sergei Starikov]] &amp;ndash; joined NHL clubs. Makarov won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as NHL Rookie of the Year in 1989-90, becoming the oldest player to win that award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/makarse01.html |title= Sergei Makarov |work= Hockey Reference |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetisov was a teammate of Mike Ramsey on the [[1994–95 Detroit Red Wings season|1995 Detroit Red Wings team]] that lost the Stanley Cup Final to Neal Broten and the New Jersey Devils. Fetisov completed his career by winning Cups with the Red Wings in [[1996–97 Detroit Red Wings season|1997]] and [[1997–98 Detroit Red Wings season|1998]]; the first Cup win also made Fetisov a member of the [[Triple Gold Club]], consisting of individuals who have won a Stanley Cup plus gold medals at the Olympics and [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/f/fetisvi01.html |title= Viacheslav Fetisov |work= Hockey Reference |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable rematches==
The U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics at the [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 games]]. The Soviets won the first round encounter 7–5. The Soviets went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.

The two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.

The U.S. and Russia met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the gold medal.

The U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final in favor of USA, with the semi-final match coming 22 years to the day after the "Miracle on Ice" game.&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"/&gt;

The two teams met at the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]]. The U.S. obtained a decisive victory 5-3 in the quarterfinal.

The U.S. and Russia played each other in the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The round robin game was tied 2–2 after overtime and was won by the Americans in an 8-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the USA. The match has been dubbed by some as the "Marathon on Ice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamusa.org/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film, television and music==
A [[Television film|made-for-TV movie]] ''[[Miracle on Ice (1981 film)|Miracle on Ice]]'', starring [[Karl Malden]] as Brooks and [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Craig, aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in March 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0082754}} Retrieved May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated actual game footage and original commentary from the 1980 Winter Games.

The documentary film ''Do You Believe in Miracles?'', narrated by [[Liev Schreiber]], premiered on [[HBO]] in February 2001 and was subsequently released on home video.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0276918}} Retrieved May 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released the film ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]'', starring [[Kurt Russell]] as Brooks. [[Al Michaels]] recreated his commentary for most of the games. The final ten seconds, however, and his "Do you believe in miracles? YES!" call, were from the original broadcast and used in the film since the filmmakers felt that they could not ask him to recreate the emotion he felt at that moment. The film was dedicated to Herb Brooks, who died shortly after principal photography was completed. The movie was released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].

''Fast Forward'', the final episode of ''[[People's Century]]'' featured the Miracle on Ice as illustrating the [[Cold War]].   

The documentary ''Of Miracles And Men'', which was directed by [[Jonathan Hock]], premiered on [[ESPN]] on February 8, 2015 as part of the channel's ''[[30 for 30]]'' series. The story of the 1980 matchup is told from the Soviet perspective while also branching out to include what happened in the years that immediately followed. [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]]'s return to Lake Placid was focused on heavily, as he takes his daughter Anastasia on the trip to reminisce.&lt;ref name="variety-ofmiracles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title=TV Review: ESPN's 'Of Miracles and Men'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/reviews/tv-review-espns-of-miracles-and-men-1201419809/|website=Variety|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nordic combined''' is a [[winter sport]] in which athletes compete in [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] and [[ski jumping]]. [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics]] and the [[FIS Nordic Combined World Cup]] are ongoing.

== History ==
The first major competition was held in 1892 in [[Oslo]] at the first [[Holmenkollen ski jump]]. [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V of Norway]] was an able jumper and competed in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival in the 1920s. It was in the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] and has been on the program ever since. Until the 1950s, the cross-country race was held first, followed by the ski jumping. This was reversed as the difference in the cross-country race tended to be too big to overcome in ski jumping. The sport has been dominated by the Norwegians, supported by the Finns. It was not until 1960 that the Nordic grip on this discipline was broken when [[West Germany|West German]] [[Georg Thoma]] won the gold medal at the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=fis&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Combined Equipment and History|url=http://www.olympic.org/nordic-combined-equipment-and-history|publisher=FIS|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided in early-November 2016 that women's competitions were to be established on FIS-level starting during the second half of the 2010s with inclusion at world championships starting in 2021 and at the Olympic Winter Games in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/news-multimedia/news/article=decisions-the-autumn-2016-fis-council-meeting-oberhofen-sui.html|title=Decisions of the Autumn 2016 FIS Council Meeting|publisher=International Ski Federation|language=English|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Olympic debut for women in 2022 was cancelled by IOC in July 2018 who was asking more development time for this discipline and then likely been added in 2026. In May of 2018 the FIS Congress made several decisions regarding the inclusion of women in the sport of Nordic Combined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2018-19/article=fis-congress-historic-milestones-for-ladies-nordic-combined|title=FIS Congress: Historic steps for Nordic Combined Ladies|website=www.fis-ski.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  As of 2019, women will be officially included in FIS Junior World Championships. It was confirmed that 2021 will mark the start of the FIS World Championship program for women (senior level).  2018 marks the second year of the Continental Cup program for women, which will include a total of 12 events.  

== Competition ==

Formats and variations currently used in the World Cup are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/extra/faq.html|title=Nordic Combined World Cup|publisher=FIS|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Individual [[Gundersen method|Gundersen]]: competition starts with one competition jump from a normal or large hill. Later on the same day, the {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race takes place. The winner starts at 00:00:00 and all other athletes start with time disadvantages according to their jumping score. The first to cross the finish line is the winner. A variation of this is the Final Individual Gundersen, consisting of two jumps and {{convert|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} of cross-country skiing in free technique.
*  Nordic Combined Triple: introduced in the [[2013–14 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup]], it features three different events on three days and one overall winner who is awarded extra World Cup points and prize money:
** Day 1: 1 jump &amp; {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Prologue
** Day 2: 1 jump &amp; {{convert|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Individual Gundersen (Top 50 from Day 1's competition)
** Day 3: 2 jumps &amp; {{convert|20|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Final Individual Gundersen (Top 30 from Day 2's competition)
* Team Event: introduced in the 1980s, one team consists of four athletes who have one competition jump each. The total score of all four athletes determines the time disadvantages for the start of the ensuing {{convert|5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race. The first team to cross the finish line wins.
* Team Sprint: teams consist of two athletes each. In the ski jumping part, every athlete makes one competition jump like in the Individual Gundersen or Team Event formats and the time behind for the start of the successive cross-country race. The team to arrive first at the finish line wins the competition.

Included in the rules but currently not used in World Cup:
* Penalty Race: instead adding a time disadvantage, distance is added to the cross-country part.
* Mass Start: the only format in which the cross-country part takes place before the ski jumping. All competitors start into a {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race in free technique at the same time. The final cross-country times are then converted into points for the ski jumping part. The winner is determined in a points-based system.

Events in the Olympics are: the sprint K120 individual, ski jumping K90 (70m), and Team/4x5km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Combined|url=http://www.olympic.org/nordic-combined|publisher=IOC|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
* [[Ski bindings]]: secure only the toe of the boot to the ski. In cross-country, it must be placed so that not more than 57% of the entire ski length is used as the front part. In jumping, a cord or aluminum post attaches the heel of the boot to the ski to prevent tips from dropping and/or wobbling of skis during flight.
* [[Ski boot]]
** For jumping, a high-backed, flexible yet firm boots with a low cut at the front, designed to allow the skier to lean forward during flight.
** For cross-country a skating boot is used.
* [[Ski suit]] and [[ski helmet|helmet]]

In [[free climbing]], a '''first ascent''' ('''FA'''), or '''first free ascent''' ('''FFA''') is the first successful, documented climb of a [[Climbing route|route]] or [[boulder]] performed without using equipment such as [[Anchor (climbing)|anchors]], [[quickdraw]]s or [[Dynamic rope|ropes]] for aiding progression or resting. In this article, notable first free ascents of hard routes and boulders are listed.

[[Grade (climbing)|Ratings]] on the hardest climbs tend to be speculative, until other climbers have had a chance to complete the routes and a consensus can be reached on the precise [[Grade (climbing)|grade]]. This becomes increasingly difficult as the grade increases, because fewer climbers are capable of repeating the route and passing judgment on its grade.

== Overview ==
As of November 2017:
* The hardest ascended route ([[#Redpointed|''Silence'']]) has a proposed grade of {{climbing grade|9c}}. It was first ascended by [[Adam Ondra]] in 2017&lt;ref name=first9c /&gt; and no one else has yet repeated it.
* The hardest route ever ascended by a woman is [[#PlantaShiva|''La Planta de Shiva'']], graded {{climbing grade|9b}}. [[Angela Eiter]] claimed its first female ascent in 2017&lt;ref name=PlantadeShiva1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PlantadeShiva2 /&gt; and no other woman has yet repeated it. 
* The hardest ascended [[Bouldering|boulder problem]] ([[#Boulder problems|''Burden of dreams'']]) has a proposed grade of {{Boulder grade|9A}}. It was first ascended by [[Nalle Hukkataival]] in 2016&lt;ref name=first9Aboulder /&gt; and no one else has yet repeated it.
* The hardest routes ever successfully climbed [[on-sight]] are graded {{Climbing grade|9a}}. The first [[on-sight]] ascent of a {{Climbing grade|9a}} route ([[#Onsighted|''Estado Critico'']]) was claimed by [[Alex Megos]] in March 2013.&lt;ref name=EstadoCritico /&gt; The second ([[#Onsighted|''Cabane au Canada'']]) by Adam Ondra in July 2013.&lt;ref name=ukc68197 /&gt; No one else has yet onsighted this grade.

The route is about 45 m long. The first 20 m are about {{climbing grade|8B}}, followed by three distinct boulder problems: an extremely hard 8C, a "burly 4-move" 8B and a 7C+ with slippery feet. The first one was described by Ondra as the hardest {{Boulder grade|8C}} he ever climbed. It consists of 10 incredibly hard and unusual moves, including single-[[Glossary of climbing terms#finger_jam|finger locks]], climbing upside down and a variation of a [[Glossary of climbing terms#figure four|figure four]] move.&lt;ref name=first9c&gt;

:* ''[[Realization (climb)|Biographie]]'' - Montagne de [[Céüse]] ([[France|FRA]]) - July 2001 - First ascent by [[Chris Sharma]]. Heralded as world's first 9a+ upon completion, because at that time [[Alexander Huber|Huber]]'s ''Open Air'' was still considered to be a 9a route (see above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camp4.com/news/index.php?newsid=117 |title=Chris Sharma climbs Realization (Biographie extension)! |publisher=Camp4 |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on its similarity with ''[[La Rambla (climb)|La Rambla Extension]]'', a {{convert|6|m|ft}} longer version of the same route, La Rambla might be considered to be the world's first 9a+, but Huber would probably disagree. In his opinion, both routes are "not harder than" [[Wolfgang Gullich]]'s ''Action Directe'', the word's first 9a, which in 1994 was still rated 8c+.&lt;ref name=huberinterview /&gt; In 2003, [[Ramón Julián Puigblanque]] climbed both routes and graded them 9a+.

== [[Deep-water solo]] routes ==
{{Climbing grade|9b}} (unconfirmed):
:* ''Alasha'' - [[Mallorca]] ([[Spain|ESP]]) - September 12, 2016.  First ascent by [[Chris Sharma]], who estimated its grade based on the effort it took to climb it without rope: "If it had bolts on it, it probably wouldn’t be a 9b (5.15b). But when you’re 60 feet up with no bolts, it takes the same amount of effort.”&lt;ref&gt;

{{Climbing grade|9a+}}:

A '''pocket schedule''' or '''fixtures card''' is a small card or foldable paper guide which typically fits in a [[wallet]] or [[pocket]]. It is most often used by [[sports club]]s or their [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] for marketing purposes, in addition to displaying the team's scheduled matches.

A typical pocket schedule may contain a full season match schedule for the team, venue information, contact information for purchasing tickets, promotional events, and major sponsor advertising. It may also include radio and television broadcast data.

Issues related to '''race and sports''' have been examined by [[scholar]]s for a long time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Lomax 2008, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these issues are racial [[discrimination]] in [[sport]]s as well as the observation that there are overrepresentations and underrepresentations of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in different sports.

=== Sprinting ===
Most of the sprinters who run less than [[10-second barrier|10 seconds]] are of [[West Africa]]n descent, with the majority being of [[Afro-Caribbean]] and [[African-American]] descent. [[Namibia]]n (formerly [[South-West Africa]]) [[Frankie Fredericks]] became the first man of non-West African heritage to achieve the feat in 1991 and in 2003 [[Australia]]'s [[Patrick Johnson (sprinter)|Patrick Johnson]] (who has Irish and [[Indigenous Australian]] heritage) became the first sub-10-second runner without an African background.&lt;ref&gt;Will Swanton and David Sygall, (2007-07-15).

In 2010, [[France|Frenchman]] [[Christophe Lemaitre]] became the first white European under ten seconds (although [[Poland]]'s [[Marian Woronin]] had unofficially surpassed the barrier with a time of 9.992 seconds in 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Błąd w odczycie wyniku Justina Gatlina|url=http://sport.wp.pl/kat,1762,title,Blad-w-odczycie-wyniku-Justina-Gatlina,wid,8315753,wiadomosc.html|publisher=www.sport.wp.pl|language=polish|date=2006-05-18|accessdate=2006-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Zimbabwe]]an [[Ngonidzashe Makusha]] became the 76th man to break the barrier, yet only the fourth man not of West African descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-sport/2010/07/09/97003-20100709FILSPO00604-9-98-pour-lemaitre.php "9"98 pour Lemaitre"], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 07-09-2010&lt;/ref&gt; No sprinter from [[South Asia]], [[East Africa]] or [[North Africa]] has officially achieved this feat.&lt;ref name="Tdojwsgl"&gt;{{cite news|last=Entine|first=Jon|title=The DNA Olympics -- Jamaicans Win Sprinting 'Genetic Lottery' -- and Why We Should All Care|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-olympics-jamaicans-win-sprinting-genetic-lottery-and-why-we-should-all-care/|accessdate=19 July 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KB&gt;Barling, Kurt (2000-09-04).

Some studies have claimed that biological factors may be largely responsible for the disproportionate success in sprinting events enjoyed by athletes of West African descent. Chief among these is a preponderance of natural [[fast twitch muscle]] fibers, which aid in quicker reaction times. Scientists have concluded that elite-level sprinting is virtually impossible in the absence of the [[ACTN3]] protein, a "speed gene" most common among persons of West African descent that renders fast twitch muscle fibers fast.&lt;ref name="Wmarstttsu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Demirel|first=Evin|title=What Made Arkansas’ Record-Setting 2012 Track Team So Unique|url=http://thesportsseer.com/2012/08/08/what-made-arkansas-record-setting-2012-track-team-so-unique/|accessdate=19 July 2013|newspaper=The Sports Seer|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top sprinters of differing ancestry, such as Christophe Lemaitre, are believed to be exceptions in that they too likely have the genes favourable for sprinting.&lt;ref name="Wmarstttsu" /&gt;

=== Endurance running ===
Many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] groups also excel in [[long distance running|long]] and [[middle distance running]]. [[Jon Entine]] has argued that this sporting prowess stems from their exceptional running economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Entine|first=Jon|title=TABOO: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We Are Afraid to Talk About It|url=http://www.jonentine.com/reviews/quokka_02.htm|publisher=Quokka|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is a function of slim body morphology and slender legs,&lt;ref name="saltin"&gt;Bengt Saltin: The Kenya project – Final report. New Studies In Athletics, vol. 2, pp. 15-24&lt;/ref&gt; a preponderance of [[slow twitch muscle]] fibers, a low [[heart rate]] gained from living at high-altitude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marathon, Updated Nov 18 2004|url=http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~edac/ws%20BBC%20Marathons.doc|publisher=Bilkent University|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a culture of running to school from a young age. A study by Pitsiladis et al. (2006) questioning 404 elite distance runners from [[Kenya]] found that 76% of the international-class respondents hailed from the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] ethnic group and that 79% spoke a [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic language]].&lt;ref name="Dcoeker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yannis Pitsiladis|first=Vincent O. Onywera, Robert A. Scott, Michael K. Boit|title=Demographic characteristics of elite Kenyan endurance runners|url=http://www.ku.ac.ke/images/stories/docs/publications/enviromental_human/Demographic-characteristics.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph L. Graves]] argues that Kenyan athletes from the [[African Great Lakes]] region who have done well in long distance running all have come from high-altitude areas, whereas those from low-altitude areas do not perform particularly well. He also argues that [[Korea]]ns and [[Ecuador]]ians from high-altitude areas compete well with Kenyans in long-distance races. This suggests that it is the fact of having trained in a high altitude, combined with possible local level physiological adaptations to high-altitude environments that is behind the success in long distance running, not race. Similarly, Graves argues that while it is superficially true that most of the world recordholders in the 100-metre dash are of West African heritage, they also all have partial genetic heritage from Europe and Native America, they have also all trained outside of West Africa, and West African nations have not trained any top-level runners. Graves says these factors make it impossible to say to which degree the success is best attributed to genetic or to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-06.htm |title=INTERVIEW WITH JOSEPH GRAVES, JR. |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |year=2003 |work=Race – The Power of Illusion |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |accessdate=April 7, 2011 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views in the United States ===
Various individuals, including scholars and [[sportswriter]]s, have commented on the apparent overrepresentations and underrepresentations of different races in different sports. [[African American]]s accounted for 75% of players in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) near the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.ncasports.org/Articles/2008_RGRC.pdf 2008_RGRC.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724084016/http://www.ncasports.org/Articles/2008_RGRC.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the latest [[National Consortium for Academics and Sports]] equality report card, 65% of [[National Football League]] players were African Americans. However, in 2008, about 8.5% of [[Major League Baseball]] players were African American (who make up about 13% of the US population, 6.5% male, no women play in MLB), and 29.1% were Hispanics of any race (compared with about 16% of the US population).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 2015, only about 5% of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) players are black or of mixed black heritage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/27557/20150220/why-you-apos-ve-never-heard-of-the-first-black-american-hockey-player&lt;/ref&gt;

NCAA sports have mirrored the trends present in American professional sports. During the 2005–2006 season, black males comprised 46.9 percent of NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and 58.9 percent of NCAA Division I basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA statistics show a strong correlation between percentage of black athletes within a sport and the revenue generated by that sport. For example, University of North Carolina's 2007–2008 men's basketball team (the team was 59% black relative to the 3.7% black population of the institution as a whole) generated $17,215,199 in revenue, which comprised 30 percent of the school's athletic revenue for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given NCAA rules prohibiting the payment of players, some have come to see the structure of NCAA athletics as exploitative of college athletes. Some believe that since black athletes comprise a high percentage of athletes in high revenue college sports (FBS football and Division I Men's basketball), they are therefore the biggest losers in this arrangement.  Billy Hawkins argues that "the control over the Black male's body and profiting off its physical expenditure is in the hands of White males."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position refers to a very high percentage of Division I universities controlled by white administrations that prosper greatly from the free labor produced by the revenue sports that are heavily populated by black athletes. This claim is substantiated by statistics, such as the 2005–2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in which games started, and minutes played for black athletes were over double that of their white counterparts, with 68.7 percent of scoring in the tournament coming from black players.&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Black athletic superiority" ====
"Black athletic superiority" is the theory that [[black people]] possess certain [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] that are acquired through [[heredity|genetic]] and/or environmental factors that allow them to excel over other [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in [[Athletic sports|athletic competition]]. Whites are more likely to hold these views; however, some blacks and other racial affiliations do as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins 1997, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buffington|first=Daniel|author2=Todd Fraley |title=Skill in Black And White: Negotiating Media Images of Race in a Sporting Context.|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2008|pages=292–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1991 poll in the United States indicated that half of the respondents agreed with the belief that "blacks have more natural physical ability".&lt;!--Who conducted the poll? for what purpose?  What other questions were there?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman 1997, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theories regarding racial differences of [[black people|black]] and [[white people]] and their possible effect on sports performance have been put forth since the later part of the nineteenth century by professionals in many different fields.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins 1997, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, attention to the subject faded over the first two decades of the twentieth century as black athletes were eliminated from white organized sport and segregated to compete among themselves on their own amateur and professional teams.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Wiggins 1997, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the subject was renewed after the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Jesse Owens]]'s record-breaking performances at the 1935 Big Ten Track Championships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;Regarding Jesse Owen’s impressive four-gold medal performance in the following 1936 Olympics, the then U.S head coach remarked that “The Negro excels. It was not long ago that his ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle. His muscles are pliable, and his easy going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=The Debate on Race and Sports Crosses the Pond|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3134375|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=39|pages=65|doi=10.2307/3134375|issn=1077-3711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, African-American [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Harry Edwards (sociologist)|Harry Edwards]] wrote: "The myth of the black male's racially determined, inherent physical and athletic superiority over the white male, rivals the myth of black sexual superiority in antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Harry |authorlink1=Harry Edwards (sociologist) |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Dunning |editor1-link=Eric Dunning |editor2-first=Dominic |editor2-last= Malcom |editor2-link= |others= |title=Sport |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4m0FbGbxcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume=3 (Sport and Power Relations) |year=2003 |origyear=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-415-26292-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=5–18 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=The Sources of the Black Athlete's Superiority |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4m0FbGbxcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Later in 2003, in ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,'' the JBHE Foundation published an article where they pushed back against this idea of a “black gene” leading to black superiority in athletics, a concept referred to here as “Racist Theory”. The JBHE contended that “If there is a “black gene” that leads to athletic prowess, why then do African Americans, 90 percent of whom have at least one ancestor, outperform blacks from African nations in every sport except long distance running?”  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=The Debate on Race and Sports Crosses the Pond|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3134375|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=39|pages=65|doi=10.2307/3134375|issn=1077-3711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Milton Hoberman]], a historian and [[Germanic studies]] professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], has acknowledged that disparities in certain athletic performances exist.  He has asserted that there is no evidence to confirm the existence of "black athletic superiority".&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman 1997, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "East Asian athletic views" ====
In the United States, [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|East Asians are stereotyped]] as being physically and athletically inferior to other races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/07/biggest-stereotypes-in-sports/asians-inferior-at-sports|title=Asians are inferior at sports compared to the rest of the world|work=Sports|publisher=Complex Sports|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LackofAsians&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prezi.com/ce_xnkquk--m/the-lack-of-asians-and-asian-american-athletes-in-professional-sports/|title=The Lack of Asians and Asian-American Athletes in Professional Sports|work=Sports|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to much discrimination in the recruitment process of professional American sports, which contributes to Asian American athletes being highly underrepresented in the majority of professional sports teams (a fact that has been noted by many sources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegoodpoint.com/asian-players-in-nfl/|title=Asian population critically underrepresented in NFL|author=Samer Kalaf|work=Sports|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bamboooffshoot.com/2012/02/27/hey-american-sports-where-are-all-the-asian-at/ |title=Hey American Sports!

[[Brandon Yip]] was the only player of Chinese descent playing professional hockey in the NHL in 2011.&lt;ref name=LackofAsians /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhl.com/news/yuen-hopes-to-become-third-chinese-canadian-nhler/c-566121&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball should be a sport that's noted for the fact that it has one of the lowest amounts of Asian athletes being represented despite the fact that the sport's color barrier was broken by an Asian American athlete back in 1947 named [[Wataru Misaka]] who was the first American racial minority to play in the [[NBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vecsey |first=George |authorlink=George Vecsey |title=Pioneering Knick Returns to Garden  | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=B-9 |date=August 11, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/sports/basketball/11vecsey.html?hp |accessdate=October 28, 2010 |quote=He lasted just three games, but is remembered as the first non-Caucasian player in modern professional basketball, three years before African-Americans were included.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American sports, there are and has been a higher representation of Asian American athletes who are of mixed racial heritage in comparison to those of full racial heritage such as the case with former football player [[Roman Gabriel]] who was the first Asian-American to start as an NFL quarterback. Another fact to note is that majority of Asian American athletes who are currently drafted/recruited to compete professionally tend to be in sports that require little to no contact.&lt;ref name=LackofAsians /&gt;

=== Chinese views ===
The idea among Chinese people that "genetic differences" cause "Asian athletes" to be "slower at sprinting" than "their American, African or European rivals" is "widely accepted".&lt;!--This is in the fifth paragraph that starts with "In many countries, particularly".--&gt; The ''[[People's Daily]]'', a Chinese newspaper, wrote that Chinese are "suited" to sports that draw upon "agility and technique", such as [[table tennis]], [[badminton]] and [[gymnastics]]. The newspaper said that Chinese people have "congenital shortcomings" and "genetic differences" that meant that they are disadvantaged at "purely athletic events" when competing against "black and white athletes".&lt;!--This is in the seventh paragraph that starts with "While Chinese are".--&gt; The success of [[Hurdling|hurdler]] [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] was explained by the hurdles event requiring technique which fit with the [[stereotype]] that Chinese are disciplined and intelligent.&lt;!--This is in the ninth paragraph that starts with "Mr. Liu's victory has not fully".--&gt;&lt;ref name="Yardley" /&gt;

Li Aidong, a researcher with the China Institute of Sports Science, said that sports coaches believed that Chinese athletes could have success in [[long jumping]], [[high jumping]] and [[race walking]].&lt;!--This is in the eighth paragraph from the bottom that starts with "Mr. Liu's victory has".--&gt; However, Li doubted that Chinese could compete in "pure [[sprint (running)|sprinting]]",&lt;!--This is in the sixth paragraph from the bottom that starts with "But Ms. Li said she doubted".--&gt; although there did not exist any "credible scientific studies" which supported the idea that "Asians" were disadvantaged in "sprinting".&lt;!--This is in the seventh paragraph from the bottom that starts with "There are no credible".--&gt;&lt;ref name="Yardley"&gt;Yardley, J.

== Explanations for participation and performance disparities ==

=== Physiological factors ===
A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that seven suggested that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance, one expressed caution with the idea, and the other 24 did not mention the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6401/is_n1_v17/ai_n28638110/ "The presentation of human biological diversity in sport and exercise science textbooks: the example of "race.""], Christopher J. Hallinan, ''Journal of Sport Behavior'', March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
In ''Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing'', [[UCLA]] researcher Jane Margolis outlines the history of segregation in swimming in the United States to show how blacks have been affected up to the present day by inadequate access to swimming facilities and [[Swimming lessons|lessons]].&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margolis |first1=Jane |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2008 |origyear= |publisher=MIT Press Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-262-13504-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=17–26 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=An Unlikely Metaphor: The Color Line in Swimming and Computer Science |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolis asserts that physiological differences between ethnic groups are relatively minor and says: "In most cases of segregation, stereotypes and belief systems about different ethnic gender groups' genetic make-up and physical abilities (and inabilities) emerge to rationalize unequal access and resulting disparities."&lt;ref name="Margolis" /&gt; According to Margolis, views regarding "buoyancy problems" of [[African Americans]] are merely part of [[folklore]] which have been passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Margolis" /&gt;  Joan Ferrante, a professor of sociology at [[Northern Kentucky University]], suggests that geographic location, financial resources, and the influence of parents, peers, and role models are involved in channeling individuals of certain races towards particular sports and away from others.&lt;ref name="Ferrante"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferrante |first1=Joan |authorlink1=Joan Ferrante |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Seeing Sociology:An Introduction |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vEbS8oBYSQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2011 |origyear= |publisher=Cengage Learning |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-495-60485-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=284–285 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Race and ethnicity: Flaws in Racist Arguments |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vEbS8oBYSQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=sport&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q=sport&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haplogroup inheritance ===
Elite athletic capacity has also been correlated with differing patterns of haplogroup inheritance. Moran et al. (2004) observed that among Y-DNA (paternal) clades borne by elite endurance athletes in Ethiopia, the [[Haplogroup E-P2|E*]], [[Haplogroup E-P2|E3*]], [[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|K*(xP)]],&lt;ref name="Moran-a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moran, Colin N., et al.|title=Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian endurance runners|journal=Human Genetics|date=2004|volume=115|issue=6|page=495|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Colin_Moran/publication/8214295_Y_chromosome_haplogroups_of_elite_Ethiopian_endurance_runners/links/54b8e8800cf28faced625c07.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2017|doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1202-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J*(xJ2)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moran, Colin N., et al.|title=Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian endurance runners|journal=Human Genetics|date=2004|volume=115|issue=6|page=494 (Fig. 1)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Colin_Moran/publication/8214295_Y_chromosome_haplogroups_of_elite_Ethiopian_endurance_runners/links/54b8e8800cf28faced625c07.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2017|doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1202-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; are positively correlated with elite athletic endurance performance, whereas the haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E3b1]] is significantly less frequent among the elite endurance athletes.&lt;ref name="Moran-a"/&gt;

Citing haplogroup data from various previous studies, Ahmetov and Fedotovskaya (2012) report that the [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDNA]] (maternal) haplogroups [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]], [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]], [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M*]], [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G1]], [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N9]], and [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] have been positively correlated with elite athletic endurance performance, whereas the mtDNA haplogroups [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3*]], [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B]], [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]], [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J2]], and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] are negatively correlated with athletic endurance performance. Japanese sprinters were also found to have a higher distribution of the mtDNA [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F]].&lt;ref name="Ahmetov"&gt;Ahmetov, Ildus I. and Olga N. Fedotovskaya (2012).

== Racial prejudices, discrimination, segregation, and integration ==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=September 2016}}
The [[baseball color line]], which included separate [[Negro league baseball]], was one example of [[racial segregation in the United States]].

In the United States, a study found that a form of racial discrimination exists in NBA basketball, as white players received higher salaries than do blacks related to actual performance. &lt;!--When?  How many?  Criteria?--&gt; Funk says this may be due to viewer discrimination. Viewership increases when there is greater participation by white players, which means higher advertising incomes. This explains much of the salary gap.&lt;ref name=Funk2001&gt;{{cite journal

Researchers have looked at other evidence for sports consumer discrimination. One method is comparing the price of sports memorabilia, such as baseball cards. Another is looking at fan voting for all-star teams. Still another is looking at willingness to attend sporting events. The evidence is mixed, with some studies finding bias against blacks and others not. A bias, if it exists, may be diminishing and possibly disappearing, according to a study on fan voting for baseball all-star teams.&lt;ref name=Funk2001 /&gt;

=== Major League Baseball ===
{{Main article|Baseball color line}}

Debuting with the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947, [[Jackie Robinson]] was the first [[African American|black]] [[Major League Baseball]] player of the modern era.

The under-representation of blacks in U.S. baseball ended during the early years of the [[civil rights movement]]. The representation of different races in Major League Baseball has been increasing since 1947 according to Mark Armour and Daniel R Levitt of the Society for American Baseball Research. According to their research, African American representation reached its peak in 1984 when it reached 18.4%. However, the African American representation has been steadily decreasing since that point. As of 2016, the African American representation was down to 6.7%.

According to Armour and Levitt, the Latino representation has been steadily increasing since 1947. That year, the representation was only at 0.7%. Since that time, the Latino representation in baseball has increased substantially. As of 2016, the Latino representation was at 27.4%.

Asian American representation in baseball has been much less abundant throughout the game’s history according to Armour and Levitt. Their representation in the Major League did not get over 1% until 1999 when their representation was at 1.2%. While the representation is increasing, it is doing so significantly slower than the other races. As of 2016 Asian American representation was only at 2.1%, a small increase from 1999.

According to Armour and Levitt, Whites make up the largest portion of the different races represented in the Major League. However, their representation has been steadily declining as the African American, Asian, and Latino representation has been steadily on the rise. The Society for American Baseball research shows that white representation was at 98.3% in 1947. Since then, representation has decreased to 63.7% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dettman|first=David|date=2017-03-20|title=SABR’s Guide to Doing Baseball ResearchRR 2017/084 SABR’s Guide to Doing Baseball Research Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Phoenix, AZ 2012- URL: http://sabr.org/how-to Last visited October 2016 Gratis, with some content restricted to SABR members|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/rr-10-2016-0248|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=31|issue=3|pages=28–28|doi=10.1108/rr-10-2016-0248|issn=0950-4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Basketball Association ===
{{Main article|National Basketball Association}}
Although [[Japanese-American]] [[Wataru Misaka]] broke the [[National Basketball Association]]'s color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the [[New York Knicks]], 1950 is recognized as the year the NBA integrated. That year [[African-American]] players joined several teams; they included [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] with the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton|Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] with the [[New York Knicks]], and [[Earl Lloyd]] with the [[Washington Bullets]].

=== National Football League ===
{{see also|Black players in American professional football|Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks}}
Black players participated in the [[National Football League]] from its inception in 1920; however, there were no African-American players from 1933 to 1946. There is a great deal of speculation as to why this “gentleman’s agreement”, as it became to be called, was implemented during this era. Some argue that it was purely because of the Great Depression. Jobs were difficult to come by, and thus race relations became increasingly strained as African-Americans, and other minorities, became perceived as “threats”. Finally, in 1946, the Los Angeles Rams broke this unofficial “agreement” and drafted Kenny Washington along with Woody Strode in the same year. The final NFL team to break this agreement was the Washington Redskins, who signed Bobby Mitchell in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781526438126|title=Media Industries and Sport Scandals: Deadspin, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and the Manti Te’o Hoax|last=Burroughs|first=Benjamin|last2=Vogan|first2=Travis|date=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics, Inc.|isbn=9781526438126|location=1 Oliver's Yard, 55 City Road, London EC1Y 1SP United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional Golfers Association ===
In 1961, the "Caucasians only" clause was struck from the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]] constitution. 

Throughout the game’s history, golf has not included many African-American players.They were often denied the opportunity to golf. However, many found a way to play the game anyway. According to an article by the African-American Registry titled African-Americans and Golf, a Brief History, “the Professional Golf Association of America (PGA) fought hard and until 1961, successfully maintained its all-white status. Black golfers (then) created their own organization of touring professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/422755031|title=African American history : an introduction|last=1945-|first=Turner-Sadler, Joanne,|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107436|edition=Rev. ed|location=New York|oclc=422755031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger Woods has had a major impact on the game of golf, especially among minorities. The article, African-Americans and Golf, a Brief History, states “With the assent of Tiger Woods and his golf game comes an increased interest and participation from young minorities in the game. He himself envisions this impacting in the next ten years as they come of age and develop physically as well." Woods hopes minority participation will continue to increase in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/422755031|title=African American history : an introduction|last=1945-|first=Turner-Sadler, Joanne,|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107436|edition=Rev. ed|location=New York|oclc=422755031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African American participation in golf has been increasing. In a journal titled African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs: The Effect on Golf after Tiger Woods, it says “Smith (1997) reported data from a National Golf Foundation (NDF) study in the United States indicating there are 676,000 African-American golfers (27% of the 24.7 million golfers)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=Venita|date=July 2003|title=African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0021934703033006005|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=33|issue=6|pages=801–816|doi=10.1177/0021934703033006005|issn=0021-9347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As African-American participation increased, Asian participation in professional golf has also increased. According to an article by Golfweek titled Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory, there were 10 golfers which was a tournament record. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romine|first=Brentley|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=April 2018|title=Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory|url=golfweek.com/2018/04/05/record-number-of-asian-golfers-compete-formasters -glory/.|journal=Golfweek|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article Where are all the black golfers? Nearly two decades after Tiger Woods’ arrival, golf still struggles to attract minorities, As of 2013 there were 25.7 million golfers which are composed of 20.3 million whites, 3.1 million Hispanics, 1.3 million African-Americans, and 1 million Asian-Americans. The lack of diversity is still very apparent in golf today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bamberger|first=Michael|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=July 2013|title=Where Are All the Black Golfers?

=== Positions of power: coaching and administration ===
Referring to quarterbacks, head coaches, and athletic directors, [[Kenneth L. Shropshire]] of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] has described the number of African Americans in "positions of power" as "woefully low".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 2000, 78% of players in the NBA were black, but only 33% of NBA officials were minorities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Duncan 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of minorities in positions of leadership has been attributed to racial stereotypes as well "[[old boy network]]s" and white administrators [[business networking|networking]] within their own race.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  In 2003, the NFL implemented the [[Rooney Rule]], requiring teams searching for a new [[head coach]] to interview at least one minority candidate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

Similar to the discrepancy between participation and leadership of blacks in American professional sports leagues, NCAA sports also have had a low percentage of administrators and coaches relative to the number of athletes. For example, during the 2005–2006 academic year, high revenue NCAA sports (basketball and football) had 51 percent black student athletes, whereas only 17 percent of head coaches in the same high revenue sports were black&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the same 2005–2006 year, only 5.5 percent of athletic directors at Division I "PWIs" (Primarily White Institutions), were black.&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010 141"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Bowden, a notable white Division I football coach, suggests that the reason many university presidents will not hire black coaches is "because they are worried about how alumni and donors will react."&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010 141" /&gt; Bowden also refers to the "untapped talent"&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010" /&gt; existing within the ranks of assistant coaches in Division I football. The data backs up this claim, with 26.9 percent of Division I assistant coaches during the 2005-06 year in men's revenue sports being black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notably higher percentage than of head coaches. In terms of administrative positions, they have been concentrated largely in the hands of whites. As recently as 2009, 92.5 percent of university presidents in the FBS were white, 87.5 percent of athletic directors were white, and 100 percent of the conference commissioners were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Kevin|title=Tennessee's Hire Shows Racism is Alive and Well in College Football|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/326890-tennessee-vols-hiring-of-dooley-shows-racism-in-cf-alive-and-well}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these statistics, black head coaches have become more prevalent at the FBS level. As of 2012, there are now 15 black head coaches in FBS football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Ted|title=Opportunities for black coaches on the rise|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7623932/opportunities-black-coaches-rise-college-football}}&lt;/ref&gt; including now 3 in the SEC, a conference that did not hire its first black head coach until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Habib|first=Daniel G.|title=The Road Ahead: Sylvester Croom's arrival at Mississippi State just starts another journey|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1030815/index.htm|work=CNN|date=15 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Segregated seating ===
In 1960, the [[Houston Oilers]] implemented a policy at [[Jeppesen Stadium]] to [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregate]] the black fans from the white fans.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax 2008, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clem Daniels]], [[Art Powell (wide receiver)|Art Powell]], [[Bo Roberson]], and [[Fred Williamson]] of the [[Oakland Raiders]] refused to play in a stadium that had segregated seating.  The 1963 game against the [[New York Jets]] was relocated to a different stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax 2008, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mascot controversies ===
{{Main article|Native American mascot controversy}}
The use of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] names and imagery for [[mascot|sport mascots]] or in franchise memorabilia is an issue of ongoing discussion and controversy in American sports, as some Native American representatives have objected to such use without explicit negotiation and permission.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2009, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promoting racial harmony and breaking stereotypes ===
According to William Jeynes, a professor of education at [[California State University, Long Beach]], the gathering at the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|first Thanksgiving in the United States]] was an attempt to create racial harmony through games and sporting contests that included [[running]], [[shooting]] and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeynes |first1=William |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=American Educational History: School, Society, and the Common Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2007 |origyear= |publisher=Sage Publications |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-4129-1421-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=9 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=The Colonial Experience, 1607–1776: Puritans' and Pilgrims' Relationship with Native Americans |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huping Ling]], a professor of history at [[Truman State University]], has asserted that the participation of Chinese students in sports helped break local stereotypes in the St. Louis area during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=LING |first1=Huping |authorlink1=Huping Ling |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Chinese St. Louis: From Enclave to Cultural Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d48Fos9tv58C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2004 |origyear= |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-59213-039-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=112 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Dwindling "Hop Alley"; 1920s – 1966 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=d48Fos9tv58C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This history of racial tension in the competition between whites and minority groups shows an attempt to prove the humanity, equality, and even occasionally their superiority on the playing field. By doing so, groups of minorities hoped that sports would serve as a source for racial pride that would eventually lead to upward social mobility. However, as early as 1984, criticism has been levied against these ideas. Sports sociologist Harry Edwards openly criticized African Americans as being “co-conspirators” in their own children’s exploitation by the white dominated sports establishment. Despite the the perception of a white dominated sports establishment, research has shown that there is greater emphasis on sports as a potential career path in the African American community compared to the White community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beamon|first=Krystal K.|date=2009-08-27|title=Are Sports Overemphasized in the Socialization Process of African American Males?

== Issues in Sports Commentating ==
Racial remarks have been made about athletes of color throughout history. Radio host Don Imus described the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hos" on his radio program "Inmus in the Morning" in 2007. Later on he proclaimed that the match-up between Rutgers and their opponents looked like a showdown of the "jigaboos versus the wannabes." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=700de70c-5ec6-40f7-bd39-0874026cc1f4@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 sports commentator Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder proclaimed his theory on why Black Americans are more athletic than White Americans:

"The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way, because of his high thighs and big thighs that goes up into his back, and they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs and he's bred to be the better athlete because this goes back all the way to the Civil War when during the slave trade … the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big black kid …"

Snyder was later fired by CBS. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=642a95b8-81fc-494a-9afb-78131b9bc861@sessionmgr102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of race and sports in the United States, where the two subjects have always been intertwined in [[American history]], have focused to a great extent on African Americans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gems 2009, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of sport and performance level, African Americans are reported to be over- or under-represented.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; African Americans compose the highest percentage of the minority groups active at the professional level, but are among those who show the lowest participation overall.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2013, while 2.8% of full-time degree-pursuing undergraduates were black men, the group comprised 57% of college football teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4110443/college-football-race-problem/ |title=College Football big problem with race |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Diane Roberts |date=November 12, 2015 |publisher=Time magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 64% of men's basketball players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/11/black-college-football-and-basketball-players-are-the-most-powerful-people-of-color-on-campus/ |title=Black college football and basketball players are the most powerful people of color on campus |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Shaun R. Harper |date=November 11, 2015  |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; While blacks predominate in football and basketball, whites predominate in all other regulated sports.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

A 2001 study indicated that black high school students play harder than white students, because the former were more likely to perceive sports as a venue to success. The study denies that racial characteristics, per se, is a factor in success in sports.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/exer_sci/ESS200/Raceh/Raceh.htm |title=Race and sport |accessdate=November 13, 2016|publisher=Smith College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all races and sports, from 3.3% (basketball) to 11.3% (ice hockey) are successful in making the transition from high school varsity to an NCAA team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/probability-competing-beyond-high-school |title=Probability of Competing Beyond High School |accessdate=November 13, 2016  |publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; From .8% (men's ice hockey) to 9.4% (baseball) successfully transition from NCAA to professional teams. Therefore, the overall success rate of high school athletes progressing to professional athletes was from .03% (men and women's basketball) to .5% (baseball).&lt;!---presume that baseball includes AAA minor leagues--&gt; The annual number of NCAA athletes drafted into professional sports annually varied from seven (men's ice hockey) to 678 (baseball).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics |title=Estimated probability of competing in professional athletics  |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |publisher=NCAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike black athletes, blacks as a group have not perceived sports as an important venue to prosperity.
There are higher participation rates by blacks as well as higher numbers of people in non-athletic endeavor, such as policy, teaching, physicians, lawyers, engineers, and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2014/09/why_are_there_so_many_black_athletes/ |title=Why Are There So Many Black Athletes? |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Henry Louis Gates Jr. |date=September 1, 2014 |publisher=theroot.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletics have been increasingly subsidized by tuition. Only one in eight of the 202 [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] colleges actually netted more money than they spent on athletics between the years 2005 and 2010. At the few money making schools, [[American football|football]] and sometimes basketball sales support the school's other athletic programs. The amount spent on an athlete in one of the six highest-profile football conferences, on average, is six times more than the amount spent to educate the non-athlete. Spending per student varied from $10,012 to $19,225; cost per athlete varied from $41,796 to $163,931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Mary Beth | last=Marklein | title=Athletics get more dollars than academics | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1837721| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=[[Melbourne, Florida]] | pages= 4A | date=January 16, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---soft copy is missing "box" (present in hard copy) which has exact figures but otherwise supports this material---&gt;

The '''International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations''', commonly known as '''Red Sport International (RSI)''' or '''Sportintern''' was a [[Comintern]]-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing [[bourgeoisie|"bourgeois"]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a [[physical culture]] movement in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called "[[Spartakiad]]" in competition with the [[Olympic games]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] before being dissolved in 1937.

==Organizational history==

===Background===

The notion of a separate [[working class]] national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a [[Workers Gymnastics Association]] was established by activists in the [[socialism|socialist]] movement in opposition to the [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[German Gymnastics Society]] ''(Turnen).''&lt;ref name=RK107&gt;James Riordan and Arnd Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century.'' London: Routledge, 1999; pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other "proletarian" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the [[Worker Track and Field Athletics Association]], among others.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; By the time of [[World War I]], the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

Following the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; The international [[social democracy|social democratic]] movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; This organization was rechristened as the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SWSI) in 1925.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and [[communism|communist]] — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.

===Establishment===
[[File:Podvoisky 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nikolai Podvoisky, first head of the Red Sports International, as he appeared as a young man.]]
The idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], who at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the [[Red Army]] for healthy and fit youth in its ranks.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the [[Olympic games]] of the "[[bourgeois]]" [[International Olympic Committee]] as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Podvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs.&lt;ref&gt;André Gounot, [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801d.pdf "Sport or Political Organization? Structures and Characteristics of the Red Sport International, 1921-1937,"] ''Journal of Sport History,'' vol. 28, no. 1 (Spring 2001), pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, [[Czechoslovakia]], France, Sweden, Italy, and [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt;

The establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 957-958.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of [[Berlin]] that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The only national "proletarian" sports organization to join the German group at that early date was the [[Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues]], said to represent 100,000 athletes.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt;

The Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the [[4th World Congress of the Comintern|4th World Congress]], the governing [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] decided to name a representative to the "independent" proletarian sport organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The [[Communist International of Youth]] (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful "proletarian class instrument."&lt;ref name=Carr8-960&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 960.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.&lt;ref name=Carr8-960 /&gt;

The governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 960-961.&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 961.&lt;/ref&gt; The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in [[Zurich]] in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint "Workers' Olympiad" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961 /&gt;

===End of autonomy===

In October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt; As the membership of Sportintern was formally "open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt;

The RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, [[Estonia]], Bulgaria, and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 963-964.&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's [[ideology|ideological]] character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.

Nikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the [[5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern]], held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carr, Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 "Workers' Olympiad" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.&lt;ref name=Carr8-965&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 965.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance.&lt;ref name=Gounot27&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity.&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt;

In the words of French sports historian André Gounot:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport."&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues.&lt;ref name=Gounot28&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical [[Third Period]] slogan of "Class versus Class" and its corollary theory of [[social fascism]] to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.&lt;ref name=Gounot28 /&gt;

===Social composition===

Membership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and [[anarchism|anarchist]] tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;''Internationaler Arbeitersport: Zeitschrift für Fragen der internationalen revolutionären Arbeitersportbewegung.'' Aug. 1931, pg. 303. Quoted in Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers.&lt;ref name=IAS /&gt; Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 38, fn. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

No details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, "it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section."&lt;ref name=Gounot29&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt;

The fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a "split organization, living in two universes," bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level.&lt;ref name=Gounot35&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.&lt;ref name=Gounot35 /&gt;

===International competitions===

The international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),&lt;ref name=RK109&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], a hereditary French nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Hill, ''Olympic Politics: Athens to Atlanta, 1896-1996.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1996; pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], both the socialists and communists agreed.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

The IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of [[social class]], dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

Therefore, the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, [[Spartacus]]) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928,  and one each in 1931 and 1937.

While a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's [[Szklarska Poręba]], Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries.&lt;ref name=RK110&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and singing of "[[The Internationale]]."&lt;ref name=RK110 /&gt; "Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.

From the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called [[Popular Front]] against the threat of [[fascism]] rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=RK113&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

The 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt; An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

===Dissolution===

With the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] secret police campaign against perceived underground [[espionage|espionage networks]] remembered as the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.

The term '''relative age effect''' (RAE), also known as '''birthdate effect''' or '''birth date effect''', is used to describe a bias, evident in the upper echelons of youth sport&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.leedsmet.ac.uk/main/view_record.php?identifier=3720&amp;SearchGroup=research{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/images/109784-birthdate-effects-a-review-of-the-literature-from-1990-on.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cee.lse.ac.uk/ceedps//ceedp93.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where participation is higher amongst those born early in the relevant selection period (and correspondingly lower amongst those born late in the selection period) than would be expected from the normalised distribution of live births. The selection period is usually the [[calendar year]], the [[academic year]] or the [[Season (sports)|sporting season]]. The difference in maturity - which can be extreme at young ages: a six-year old born in January is almost 17% older than a six-year old born in December in the same year&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/relative-age-effect-over-long-term|title=Long-term relative age effect: Evidence from Italian football|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; - causes a performance gap that persists over time.

The term '''month of birth bias''' is also used to describe the effect and '''season of birth bias''' is used to describe similar effects driven by different hypothesised mechanisms.

The bias results from the common use of age related systems, for organizing youth sports competition and academic cohorts, based on specific cut-off dates to establish eligibility for inclusion. Typically a child born after the cut-off date is included in a cohort and a child born before the cut-off date is excluded from it.

== In sports ==
The most commonly used cut-off date for youth international sporting competition is 1 January. The [[IOC]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Youth_Olympic_Games.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FIFA]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/95/44/82/regulationsfu20wcturkey2013%5fee.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 6 international football confederations ([[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]], [[CONCACAF]], [[CONMEBOL]], [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] and [[UEFA]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/65/31/62/1653162_DOWNLOAD.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) all use 1 January as their administrative cut-off date when determining an athlete's eligibility to compete in youth competitions, children born before a specified cut-off date are excluded.

Malcolm Gladwell's book [[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]] and [[SuperFreakonomics]] by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner have popularised the issue in respect of Canadian ice-hockey players, European football players and US Major League baseball players.

The expected distribution of births in any given month across a population correlates closely to the number of days in the month, with February as the shortest month having the fewest births. The first graph shows the distribution of births, by month, for the [[European Union]] over the ten years from 2000 to 2009. There is a slight but clearly perceptible increase in the birth rate in the summer months.

A relative age effect is illustrated in the second graph by the month of birth distribution of over 4,000 youth players involved in the qualifying squads for U17, U19 and U21 tournaments organised by [[UEFA]] in 2010/11.

Research suggests that individuals born closer to the cut-off date are more likely to play professionally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1123/ssj.16.1.54 |title=The Relative Age Effect in Soccer: Cross-Cultural Evidence for a Systematic Discrimination against Children Born Late in the Competition Year |journal=Sociology of Sport Journal |volume=16 |pages=54 |year=1999 |last1=Musch |first1=Jochen |last2=Hay |first2=Roy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dukeorthopaedicjournal.com/mostdownloaded.aspx|title=The Duke Orthopaedic Journal - Jaypee Journals - Jaypee Brother|website=www.dukeorthopaedicjournal.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2011.11.009 |ssrn=1835304 |title=Returns to education in professional football |journal=Economics Letters |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=326–8 |year=2012 |last1=Böheim |first1=René |last2=Lackner |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In academia ==
Cut-off dates for academic cohort structuring, including the setting of [[Academic term|academic years]], are usually determined by national education authorities and tend to be based on autumn start dates, so August or September cut-off dates are common in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and February or March cut-off dates are common in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. This tendency reflects the historical need for children to be involved in summer-time agricultural work with school starting after harvesting.[[File:Oxford 10 years.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Oxford University RAE profile in aggregate 2004/5 to 2013/14]]A relative age effect in academia is illustrated in the third graph which shows the percent deviation from month of birth profile norms evident in graduations from Oxford University over a 10-year period. Academic relative age effects seem to be moderated by culture.&lt;ref name="RADutch"/&gt;

A 2006 study finds that relative age affects student performance and has long-lasting effects on life outcomes. The authors find that "the youngest members of each cohort score 4–12 percentiles lower than the oldest members in grade four and 2–9 percentiles lower in grade eight… data from Canada and the United States show that the youngest members of each cohort are even less likely to attend university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/qje/121.4.1437 |jstor=25098831 |title=The Persistence of Early Childhood Maturity: International Evidence of Long-Run Age Effects |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=1437–72 |year=2006 |last1=Bedard |first1=K |last2=Dhuey |first2=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study finds that Italian students born in the early months of the year "are more likely to be tracked in more academic schools rather than in vocational schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpolmod.2014.04.001 |title=The long-lasting effects of school entry age: Evidence from Italian students |journal=Journal of Policy Modeling |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=578–99 |year=2014 |last1=Ponzo |first1=Michela |last2=Scoppa |first2=Vincenzo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In leadership positions ==
A relative age effect has also been observed in the context of leadership. Studies have found an over-representation of people born just after the school entry cut-off date in a range of leadership positions. Such an over-representation starts in high-school leadership activities such as sports team captain or club president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2006.08.005 |title=What makes a leader? Relative age and high school leadership |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=173–83 |year=2008 |last1=Dhuey |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Lipscomb |first2=Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the adult life, this over-representation has been observed in top managerial positions (CEOs of S&amp;P 500 companies),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2012.08.017 |title=The relative-age effect and career success: Evidence from corporate CEOs |journal=Economics Letters |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=660–2 |year=2012 |last1=Du |first1=Qianqian |last2=Gao |first2=Huasheng |last3=Levi |first3=Maurice D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in top political positions, both in the USA (senators and representatives),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/rssa.12154 |title=Born leaders: Political selection and the relative age effect in the US Congress |journal= Series A (Statistics in Society) |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=809–29 |year=2016 |last1=Muller |first1=Daniel |last2=Page |first2=Lionel }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Finland (MPs).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/148931/wp94.pdf?sequence=1{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other spheres ==
Whilst an over-representation of early-born participation is evident in the aspirational fields of elite sport and education there is also evidence of a corresponding disproportionate over-representation of late-born children in [[Epidemiology|epidemiologically]] defined cohorts exhibiting conditions such as [[ADHD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.111619 |pmid=22392937 |pmc=3328520 |title=Influence of relative age on diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=7 |pages=755–62 |year=2012 |last1=Morrow |first1=R.

==Lexicon==
* '''[[wikt:ability grouping|Ability grouping]]''' – cohort selection by ability rather than chronological age.
* '''Corrective Relative Age Adjustments''' – calculated adjustments to competitive outcomes designed to compensate for relative age advantage/disadvantage, for example by the re-calculation of sprint times according to relative age within a cohort.&lt;ref name="Relative Age Effects in Athletic Sprinting and Corrective Adjustments as a Solution for Their Removal"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0122988 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Relative Age Effects in Athletic Sprinting and Corrective Adjustments as a Solution for Their Removal | journal=PLOS One | pages=e0122988 | pmid=25844642 | pmc=4386815 | last1 = Romann | first1 = M | last2 = Cobley | first2 = S| year=2015 | bibcode=2015PLoSO..1022988R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cut-off date''' – an administratively defined date in the calendar which determines the eligibility of individuals to be included in a cohort, usually a competition or an academic year group. A birth date prior to the cut-off date excludes an individual and a birth date after the cut-off date includes an individual.
* '''Multi-age grouping''' – the broadening of cohort selection to encompass multiple chronological age groups. For example, a [[Multi-age classroom]].
* '''Relative Age Advantage''' – a competitive advantage accruing to an individual due to being born early in a selection period. A relative age advantage can also accrue to a group consisting of a majority of relatively older individuals.&lt;ref name="socialproblemindex.med.ualberta.ca"&gt;http://www.socialproblemindex.med.ualberta.ca/RelAgeMinorHockeyCJBS.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Relative Age Bias''' – a tendency towards the prioritised selection of relatively older members of a cohort.
* '''Relative Age Characteristic''' (of an individual) – the quality of having been born early or late in the selection period.
* '''Relative Age Competition''' – competition designed to avoid cut-off date rules, such as ‘average team age’ or ‘bio-banded’ competition.
* '''Relative Age Disadvantage''' – a competitive disadvantage accruing to an individual due to being born late in a selection period. A relative age disadvantage can also accrue to a group consisting of a majority of relatively younger individuals.&lt;ref name="socialproblemindex.med.ualberta.ca"/&gt;
* '''Relative Age Discrimination''' – indirect, systemic discrimination, disadvantaging relatively young individuals in a cohort and advantaging relatively old individuals in the same cohort.
* '''Relative Age Effect''' – an observable '''effect''' resulting from a '''relationship''' between '''chronological age''' and an eligibility '''cut-off date''' used for cohort selection.
* '''Relative Age Environment''' – the system of rules governing inclusion or exclusion from cohorts based on cut-off date eligibility rules.
* '''Relative Age Quota''' – a quota system imposed on a cohort to establish an even distribution of chronological ages.
* '''Relative Age Skew''' – statistically significant differing levels of participation observed amongst relatively older and relatively younger members of a cohort.
* '''Selection Period''' – an administratively or culturally defined timeframe, such as a competition season or an academic year, established by reference to a cut-off date.

'''Sport climbing''' is a form of [[rock climbing]] that relies on permanent [[anchor (climbing)|anchors]] fixed to the rock for [[protection (climbing)|protection]]. This is in contrast to [[traditional climbing]] where climbers must place removable protection as they climb.

Sport climbing emphasises [[physical strength|strength]], [[endurance]], gymnastic ability and technique, over [[adventure]], [[risk]] and [[self-sufficiency]]. For the majority of sport climbers, sport climbing offers an easier, more convenient experience which requires less equipment, less in the way of technical skills required to be safe during the climb, and lower levels of mental stress than traditional climbing.

With increased accessibility to climbing walls, and gyms, more climbers now enter the sport through indoor climbing than outdoor climbing. The transition from indoor climbing to sport climbing is not difficult because the techniques and equipment used for indoor climbing are nearly sufficient for sport climbing. Whereas the transition from indoor climbing to traditional climbing is hard because traditional climbing requires significantly more in terms of techniques, experience, and equipment.

While sport climbing is common in many areas worldwide, it is heavily restricted in some places where it is considered ethically unacceptable to bolt climbs. This is largely due to the local climbing traditions, and to the type of rock; for instance, it is often considered reasonable to bolt limestone or slate quarries in the UK, especially if these are otherwise unprotectable, but it is considered completely unacceptable to bolt [[gritstone]] regardless as to how dangerous a climbing path might be. Debates over bolting in the climbing communities are often fierce. Bolting without a consensus in favour of bolting generally leads to the destruction, or removal, of the bolts by activists against bolting.

Since sport climbing paths do not need to follow climbing paths where protection can be placed they tend to follow more direct, and straight forward, paths up crags than [[Traditional climbing|traditional climbing paths]] which can be winding and devious by comparison. This, in addition to the need to place gear, tends to result in different styles of climbing between sport and traditional.

Sport climbing is scheduled to make its Olympic debut at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].

== Basics ==
[[File:Oprema sportno plezanje.jpg|thumb|Sport climbing equipment. From left to right, top to bottom are: rope, helmet, climbing shoes, harness, chalk bag, belay device, and quick draws.]]

On a sport climbing route, pre-placed bolts follow a 'line' up a rock face. Sport climbs can vary in length from a few metres to a full {{convert|60|m|ft|adj=on}} rope length for multi-pitch climbs. The climbs might be [[Climbing equipment|equipped]] with just a few bolts or many.

Sport climbing can be undertaken with relatively little equipment. Equipment used in sport climbing includes:

* A [[dynamic rope]]
* [[Quickdraw]]s
* A [[Climbing equipment#Belay devices|belay device]]
* [[Climbing harness]]es for belayer and climber
* [[Climbing shoes]] and [[Climbing equipment#Chalk bag|chalk bag]] are normally used, although not technically necessary

To [[lead climbing|lead]] a sport climb means to ascend a route with a rope tied to the climber's harness, and with the loose end of the rope handled by a [[belay]]er. As each bolt is reached along the route, the climber attaches a quickdraw to the bolt, and then clips the rope through the hanging end of the quickdraw. This bolt is now protecting the climber in the event of a fall. At the top of sport routes, there is typically a two-bolt anchor that can be used to return the climber to the ground or previous rappel point.

Because sport routes do not require placing protection, the climber can concentrate on the difficulty of the moves rather than placing protection or the consequences of a fall.

Sport climbing differs from [[traditional climbing]] with respect to the type and placement of protection. Traditional climbing uses mostly removable protection (such as [[spring loaded camming device|cams]] or [[nut (climbing)|nuts]]), and tends to minimize the usage of pre-placed protection. Sport climbing typically involves single [[pitch (vertical space)|pitch]] routes but can have multi-pitch routes. Long multi-pitch routes may lack pre-placed anchors due to economical, logistical or ethical reasons.

Rock types that produce good sport climbs include [[limestone]], [[granite]] and [[quartzite]], though sport climbs can be found on almost all rock types.

===Ratings===
{{main|Climbing grade}}
Sport climbs are assigned [[subjectivity|subjective]] ratings to indicate difficulty. The type of rating depends on the geographic location of the route, since different countries and climbing communities use different rating systems.

The [[UIAA]] grading system is mostly used for short rock routes in Western Germany, Austria and Switzerland and most countries in Eastern Europe. On long routes it is often used in the Alps and Himalaya. Using Roman numerals, it was originally intended to run from I (easiest) to X (hardest), but as with all other grading systems, improvements to climbing standards have led to the system being open-ended. An optional + or – may be used to further differentiate difficulty. As of 2018, the hardest climbs are XII.

The [[Ewbank rating system]], used in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]], is a numerical open-ended system, starting from 1, which you can (at least in theory) walk up, up to 38 (as of 2013).

The [[France|French]] rating system considers the overall difficulty of the climb, taking into account the difficulty of the moves and the length of climb. This differs from most grading systems where one rates a climbing route according to the most difficult section (or single move). Grades are numerical, starting at an easy 1, with the system being open-ended. Each numerical grade can be subdivided by adding a letter (a, b or c). Examples: 2, 4, 4b, 6a, 7c. An optional + (but not –) may be used to further differentiate difficulty. Many countries in Europe use a system with similar grades but not necessarily matching difficulties. Sport climbing in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] uses the French grading system, often prefixed with the letter "F".

In the [[United States]], the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] is used to rate sport climbs. Current grades for sport routes vary between an easy 5.0 to an extremely difficult 5.16, although the system is open-ended. Past 5.10, letter grades between ''a'' and ''d'' are sometimes used for further subdivision (e.g. 5.11a or 5.10d). Pluses and minuses may also be used (e.g. 5.9+ or 5.11–).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spadout.com/wiki/index.php/Climbing_Grades |title=Climbing Grades |publisher=Spadout.com |date=May 15, 2007 |access-date=November 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202150948/http://www.spadout.com/wiki/index.php/Climbing_Grades |archivedate=February 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the YDS rating was designed to rate the difficulty of the hardest move on a given route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climbing.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/YDS.htm |title=The Yosemite Decimal System, Rating Rock Climbs |website=[[Dotdash|About.com]] |access-date=November 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210004217/http://climbing.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/YDS.htm |archive-date=February 10, 2008 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern sport grades often take into account other features such as length and number of difficult moves along the route.

==Ethics==
The ethics climbers adopt toward their sport are not always steadfast, and they often depend on the venue. The following examples are merely outlines that do not always hold true.

===Bolting===
Whether a route should be bolted as a sport climb is often in dispute.

In some areas, including some in the United States, if a route cannot be safely climbed with the use of traditional gear, it is generally acceptable to the climbing community to bolt it. In much of the United Kingdom, similar bolting is widely considered unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG95yGRaooY#t=8m21 |title=Scottish Ice trip in Ben Nevis – English |publisher=petzlcrew |date=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations regarding bolting can vary from state to state and between landowners or land managers.

Additionally, the method of bolting may often be challenged. Many early sport routes were bolted on lead by the [[First ascent|first ascender]]: a "traditional" approach. One could say that it became "sport" climbing when routes started to get bolted from the top (hanging on a rope).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountaineers.org/NWMJ/05/051_Ethics.html |title=Rock Climbing Ethics: A Historical Perspective (Part 1) |author=Matt Perkins |work=[[Northwest Mountaineering Journal]] |access-date=November 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504084726/http://www.mountaineers.org/nwmj/05/051_Ethics.html |archive-date=May 4, 2009 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First ascents===
{{main|First ascent}}
Sometimes, a newly bolted route is considered "red tagged," and ethics dictate that the person who bolted the route should be the only climber to attempt it until they have made a free ascent (a continuous roped ascent, made using only hands and feet, unaided – yet protected – by the bolts, quickdraws or rope). This is because equipping a new route is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor for the person who finds it. Other times, the bolter will allow the route they developed to become an "open project" that anyone can try. Ascents of reserved routes have led to a number of controversies in the sport climbing world.

===Chipping, comfortizing, and reinforcing===
Changing the natural features of rock is often frowned upon, but in many parts of the world it is accepted to some extent. In some areas, "[[Chipping (Rock Climbing)|chipping]]" of the rock with a chisel or similar tool to create a hold that did not exist naturally is considered acceptable. This is particularly true in some quarries as well as some European crags. However, at many other areas, local ethics absolutely forbid this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetfear.com/article_detail.asp?a_id=138|title=Starting Out: Ethics|author=Adrian Berry|date=May 18, 2002|website=planetfear.com|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813232845/http://www.planetfear.com/article_detail.asp?a_id=138|archive-date=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comfortizing holds often involves aggressively cleaning a route to the point where sharp holds have been filed down, often making them somewhat easier to use. While many climbers frown on this, in some areas comfortizing is considered acceptable to a point.

Reinforcing rock with glue is the most widely accepted modification to natural features in the sport climbing world. When a popular route is climbed over and over, holds may become looser and closer to breaking. Sometimes, these holds will be reinforced to prevent them from breaking. Other times, if a hold entirely breaks off, it may be glued back on. In most areas, these practices are considered acceptable if done neatly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Sending===
Sometimes, an ascent or the style in which it is done will come into dispute. For example, a leader who experiences tension on their rope from their belayer while climbing without falling may have not made a valid ascent, through no fault of their own. Additionally, the line between an onsight and a flash is often disputed. Some climbers consider any knowledge of a route, including its grade, to be data that invalidates an onsight. However, other climbers will go so far as to belay another climber on a route and still claim that they did not have enough prior knowledge to move from the onsight realm to the flash realm.

===Working a route===
If a climber fails to onsight or flash a route, they may decide to "work" it by attempting to climb it despite falling and hanging on the rope. If, after practising the moves either on lead or on toprope, they manage to lead the route cleanly (i.e. without any rests or falls) then it is called a [[Redpoint (climbing)|redpoint]]. It is known as a 'ground up' ascent if they work the route from the bottom, progressing higher on successive attempts without cheating or resting. However, at popular destinations, multiple parties of climbers will often line up to try a route. A climber working a route may spend an inordinate amount of time on it, preventing other parties from climbing it. This is often frowned upon, particularly if the climber is toproping rather than leading.

Not sending a route means that a climber was unable to climb a route without hanging on the rope or falling: a clean lead or send refers to someone climbing a route entirely under his/her own power without assist from the rope. Although not considered a proper, clean ascent if a climber does not do this in professional terms, a lower-level climber will have 'done' the route if he completed all the moves, even if it was 'unclean', i.e. rests or falls were taken (in this instance, it would be said that the route was 'dogged').

===Access and conflicts===
The United States has a strong history of traditional climbing, especially at certain crags, and considerable value is placed on keeping routes the same as they were when pioneered by the [[first ascent|first ascender]]. In the U.S. it is considered unacceptable to add bolts to an established traditional route to turn it into a sport climb.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the UK, a number of established routes have been bolted by sport climbers; this has generally been done in recent years by consensus with the first climber, though in earlier years this was not always the case. In Spain also, traditional climbs have been overbolted against the wishes of traditional climbers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 2007, the British Mountaineering Council introduced 10,000 bolts into the UK climbing scene mostly to replace existing unsafe fixed protection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

[[bird watching|Bird watchers]] and other non-climbing rural visitors sometimes object to being distracted by brightly colored slings left at rappel anchors, which has led to climbers using webbing of the same color as the rock.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Competition climbing ==
Competition climbing is a form of sport climbing that takes place on artificial structures rather than natural rock surfaces. It has three different disciplines: [[lead climbing]], [[speed climbing]] and [[bouldering]]. The latter is considered to be the most demanding of the three disciplines in terms of strength, co-ordination and agility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas-rockstars.com/en/general-info/competition-bouldering/|title=Competition bouldering|work=adidas Rock Stars|access-date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, competition climbing is still just known as "sport climbing". However, in English-speaking countries the term "sport climbing" refers exclusively to climbing that takes place on bolted routes on rock surfaces, while "competition climbing" always refers to the climbing that makes use of artificial surfaces. This anomaly can cause confusion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Sport climbing made its debut as an [[Asian Games]] sport in the [[2018 Asian Games|18th edition]] in Jakarta-Palembang, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/|title=Asian Games 2018 – Sport Climbing|website=en.asiangames2018.id|access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympics===
In September 2015, sport climbing was included in a shortlist along with [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[skateboarding]], [[surfing]], and [[karate]] to be considered for inclusion in the [[2020 Summer Olympics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grindtv.com/surf/surfing-skateboarding-make-shortlist-2020-olympics/#o7ywgs7MO0zEB9MH.97 |title=Surfing and skateboarding make shortlist for 2020 Olympics |website=GrindTV.com |date=September 28, 2015 |access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2016, the Executive Board of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) announced that they would support the proposal to include all of the shortlisted sports in the 2020 Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-executive-board-supports-tokyo-2020-package-of-new-sports-for-ioc-session |title=IOC Executive Board supports Tokyo 2020 package of new sports for IOC Session - Olympic News |website=Olympic.org |date=June 1, 2016 |access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on August 3, 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOC approves five new sports for Olympic Games Tokyo 2020|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-approves-five-new-sports-for-olympic-games-tokyo-2020|website=Olympic.org|date=August 3, 2016|access-date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed format for Olympic sport climbing will require participants to compete in all three disciplines – lead climbing, speed climbing and bouldering – an approach that has been widely criticized by potential competitors and followers of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.climbing.com/news/what-the-hell-is-speed-climbing/|title=What the Hell is Speed Climbing?|website=www.climbing.com|date=September 26, 2016|access-date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Sports journalism''' is a form of [[writing]] that reports on [[sport]]ing topics and [[sports competition|competitions]]. 

Sports [[journalism]] is the essential element of many [[news media]] organizations. While the sports department (along with [[Entertainment journalism|entertainment news]]) within some [[newspaper]]s has been mockingly called the ''toy department'', because sports [[journalist]]s do not concern themselves with the 'serious' topics covered by the news desk, sports coverage has grown in importance as sport has grown in [[wealth]], [[Economic power|power]], and [[Social influence|influence]].

Also, some media organizations are devoted entirely to sports [[Journalism|reporting]] — newspapers and [[magazine]]s such as ''[[L'Equipe]]'' in [[France]], ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in [[Italy]], ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' in [[Spain]], the defunct ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' in Britain, and American ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Sporting News]]''; [[television network]]s such as ''[[Eurosport]]'', ''[[Fox Sports]]'', ''[[ESPN]]''; [[sports radio]] stations such as ''[[BBC Radio 5 Live]]'', ''[[ESPN Radio]]'', ''[[Fox Sports Radio]]'' and ''[[TSN Radio]]''; and ''[[The Sports Network|The Sports Network (TSN)]]''; and websites such as [[ESPN.com]], [[Foxsports.com]], and [[Yahoo! Sports]].

== Socio-political significance ==
[[Major League Baseball]] gave print journalists a special role in its games. They were named [[official scorer]]s and kept statistics that were considered part of the official record of league.  Active sportswriters were removed from this role in 1980.  Although their statistical judgment calls could not affect the outcome of a game in progress, the awarding of errors and wins/saves were seen as powerful influences on pitching staff selections and play lists when coach decisions seemed unusual.  The removal of writers, who could benefit fiscally from sensational sports stories, was done to remove this perception of a [[conflict of interest]], and to increase statistics volume, consistency, and accuracy.

Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: [[Jackie Robinson]] breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of [[anabolic steroids]] and other, banned [[performance-enhancing drugs]], and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for [[Olympic Games]], also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages.

Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team.

== In Europe ==
The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports – such as association football, [[cricket]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] – were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today.&lt;!-- Reference?  --&gt;

Andrew Warwick has suggested that [[The Boat Race]] provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'',  page 213, [[University of Chicago Press]]  {{ISBN|0-226-87374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Race, an annual [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] event between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], has been held annually from 1856.

[[Cricket]], possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', in the first half of the 20th century, employed [[Neville Cardus]] as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, [[John Arlott]], who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the [[BBC]], was also known for his poetry.

The first [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' even had Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] at the [[White City Stadium]] to cover the finish of the [[Marathon]].

Such was the drama of that race, in which [[Dorando Pietri]] collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by [[Queen Alexandra]]. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the [[1908 Olympic Marathon]], and the official length of the event worldwide to this day.

The London race, called the [[Polytechnic Marathon]] and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at [[Windsor Castle]] to White City, was first sponsored by the ''Sporting Life'', which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the [[Second World War]].

The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer [[Edgar Wallace]], who made a report on [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] on June 6, 1923 for the [[British Broadcasting Company]].

In France, ''[[L'Auto]]'', the predecessor of ''L'Equipe'', had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The [[Tour de France]] was born, and sports journalism's role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which ''L'Auto'' was published (in Italy, the [[Giro d'Italia]] established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, ''La Gazzetta'').

== Sports stars in the press box ==
After the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day's football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings.

Some newspapers, such as ''[[Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', with 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion [[Harold Abrahams]], or the London ''Evening News'' using former England cricket captain Sir [[Leonard Hutton]], began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards.

Many "ghosted" columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the [[Cricket Reporting Agency]], which routinely provided the editors of the [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]] cricket almanac, and Hayters.

Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The ''Daily Mirror'''s Peter Wilson, [[Hugh McIlvanney]], first at ''The Observer'' and lately at the ''Sunday Times'', [[Ian Wooldridge]] of the ''Daily Mail'' and soccer writer [[Brian Glanville]], best known at the ''Sunday Times'', and columnist Patrick Collins, of the ''Mail on Sunday'', five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award.

Many became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} of often earth-shattering events that have transcended the back pages and been reported on the front pages: the [[Munich massacre|Massacre at the Munich Olympics]] in 1972; [[Muhammad Ali]]'s fight career, including his 1974 title bout against [[George Foreman]]; the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel]] Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of [[Tiger Woods]], [[George Best]], [[David Beckham]], [[Lester Piggott]] and other high-profile stars.

McIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of [[IMG (company)|IMG]], the agency founded by the American businessman, [[Mark McCormack]], to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.

== Investigative journalism and sport ==
Since the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers.

[[Tom Bower]], with his 2003 sports book of the year ''Broken Dreams'', which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by [[Andrew Jennings]] and [[Vyv Simson]] with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson's ''The Lords of the Rings'' in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on [[FIFA]], the world football body.

Likewise, award-winning writers [[Duncan Mackay (journalist)|Duncan Mackay]], of ''The Guardian'', and [[Steven Downes]] unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, ''Running Scared'', which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, [[Cliff Temple]].

But the writing of such exposes - referred to as "spitting in the soup" by [[Paul Kimmage]], the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the ''Sunday Times'' – often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by "beat" correspondents.
 
The stakes can be high when upsetting sport's powers: in 2007, England's [[the Football Association|FA]] opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the [[FA Cup]] and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV. One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/2323773/Exclusive-the-England-players-revolt.html England football team].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Sports books==

Increasingly, sports journalists have turned to [[Long-form journalism|long-form writing]], producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. [[Dan Topolski]] was the first recipient of the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.

== Organizations ==
Most countries have their own national [[Sports Journalists' Association|association of sports journalists]]. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism.

The International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world's biggest sports federations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], football's world governing body FIFA, and the [[IAAF]], the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives:
* to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members.
* to strengthen the friendship, solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries.
* to assure the best possible working conditions for the members.

For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers’ Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media.

[[File:Press room at the Philips Stadion.jpg|thumb|Press room at the Philips Stadion, home of [[PSV Eindhoven]], prior to a press conference]]

In Britain, the Sports Journalists' Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's "Oscars", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers' Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist [[Sir Michael Parkinson]]. The SJA represents the British sports media on the [[British Olympic Association]]'s press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, [[Martin Samuel]], then the chief football correspondent of ''The Times'', was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, [[Jeff Stelling]], of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the ''Sunday Times'''s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.

In the United States, the Indianapolis-based [[National Sports Journalism Center]] monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors, the largest group of sports media professionals in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In more recent years,{{When|date=May 2015}} sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services. This has become even more apparent with the increase in online social engagement. This has led to an increasing number of freelance journalism in the sports industry and an explosion of sports related news and industry websites.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Fanzines and blogs ==
Through the 1970s and '80s, a rise in "citizen journalism" in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer "fanzines" - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive.

Some authors, such as [[Jim Munro]], have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the [[West Ham United]] fanzine ''Fortune's Always Dreaming'', Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine ''When Saturday Comes'', have effectively gone mainstream.

The advent of the internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, [[Bleacher Report]], [[Deadspin.com]], ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, [http://www.massholesports.com Masshole Sports], the blogs in the [[Yardbarker]] Network, and others have garnered massive followings.

Blogging has also been taken up by former athletes such as [[Curt Schilling]], [[Paula Radcliffe]], [[Greg Oden]], [[Donovan McNabb]], and [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]].

==Smartphones==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}
Since the beginning of smartphones and the use of applications, sports media has taken off and has become accessible from almost anywhere at any time. Not only can fans check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media, but people can use social media apps as well to find out different scores. These apps give score updates, rosters, game schedules, injury updates, and much more right when it happens. People can get real time results right from their phone. They do not need to be at the game, or right by their television, to see how their favorite team is doing. Now people can stream games right from their phone.

This type of fast, easy information is very important to sports fans. As stated in a Time magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/01/26/social-media-and-sports-natural-teammates/|title=Social Media and Sports: Natural Teammates|work=TIME.com|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Enthusiastic fans are eager for updates on their favorite teams and the opportunity to rant about what went wrong in the playoffs or why their coach should be fired”. Many people want to discuss matters about sports, teams and games, and this article shows that with the sports apps, the news can be found at a moment’s notice.

Thanks to the smartphone, a fan no longer has to wait for scores or search the web for information on players. All the information is available at the palm of their hand. Sports apps do not always have to be about giving scores, as some applications include workout helpers, rule books, and even games. The workout apps can show how the professionals’ workout and can give inspiration to do the same workout. The rule books are important, because it spreads the knowledge about the game, and it can get people interested in new games. The games apps are a good way of teaching people how the game is played, and can give players a bigger interest in a specific sport. All of these different apps are a part of sports media in the form of using smartphones and apps. This helps spread information about sports to anyone who wants it.

Smartphones can not only be used just for scores, they can also help athletes become known and recruited. These days most everything is caught on camera, and that includes great plays made by athletes. Once a video is taken it will be spread through the social media sites in no time.

==Gender==

The number of women in the sports journalism industry is rapidly growing, and this has caused a lot of controversy in recent years. Many traditionalists believe that the sporting industry should be predominately for men, and female journalists have endured a lot of criticism for breaking the mold.

There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away.

Some breakthrough female reporters include [[Adeline Daley]] (whom some consider the "Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kipen|first=David|title=Fact: The Golden State is the epicenter of baseball, a mother lode of sun-ripened talent|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Fact-The-Golden-State-is-the-epicenter-of-2705387.php|accessdate=2014-05-20|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Anita Martini]], Tracy Dodds, [[Mary Garber]], [[Lesley Visser]] and [[Sally Jenkins]].

'''Sportsmanship''' is an aspiration or ethos that a [[sport]] or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake, with proper consideration for [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], [[ethics]], [[respect]], and a sense of [[fellow]]ship with one's competitors. A "sore loser" refers to one who does not take defeat well, whereas a "good sport" means being a "good winner" as well as being a "good loser"&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Joel Fish and Susan Magee, ''101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent'', p. 168. Fireside, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lacey, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html "It takes a bad loser to become a good winner."] ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (someone who shows courtesy towards another in a sports game).

== Analysis ==

Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sports situations. In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence,&lt;ref name="Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995"&gt;Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly, maintaining self-control if dealing with others, and respect for both authority and opponents. Sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one 
reacts to a sport/game/player.

The four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form, the will to win, equity and fairness. All four elements are critical and a balance must be found among all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; These elements may also cause conflict, as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship. This will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman, but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsman like. When athletes become too self-centred, the idea of sportsmanship is dismissed.&lt;ref name="ahola"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|title =Promoting Sportsmanship in Youth Sports|last1 = Goldstein |first1=Jay|last2=Iso-Ahola |first2 = Seppo|date = 2006|journal =Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|doi = 10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|issue = 7|volume = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's sporting culture, in particular the base of elite sport, places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; In most, if not all sports, sportsmen at the elite level make the standards on sportsmanship and no matter whether they like it or not, they are seen as leaders and role models in society.&lt;ref name="clifford"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Clifford |journal=Newcastle Herald |date=2013 |title=Sport's also about sportsmanship |volume=1 |issue=33 |url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Sport%27s+also+about+sportsmanship&amp;rft.jtitle=Newcastle+Herald&amp;rft.au=KEN+CLIFFORD&amp;rft.date=2013-12-10&amp;rft.pub=Fairfax+Digital&amp;rft.issn=0727-9825&amp;rft.spage=33&amp;rft.externalDocID=3149922301&amp;paramdict=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since every sport is rule driven, the most common offence of bad sportsmanship is the act of cheating or breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage this is called [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="feez"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|title = Sportsmanship|last = Feezell|first = Randolph|date = 1986|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|issue = 1|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after losing a game or contest is often called a "sore loser", while a competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after winning is typically called a "bad winner". Sore loser behavior includes blaming others for the loss, not accepting responsibility for personal actions that contributed to the defeat, reacting to the loss in an immature or improper fashion, [[rationalization (psychology)|making excuses]] for the defeat, and citing unfavorable conditions or other petty issues as reasons for the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;"MJD", [https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/If-he-s-going-to-lose-Bill-Belichick-would-rath?urn=nfl,64971 "If he's going to lose, Bill Belichick would rather be elsewhere"]. Yahoo Sports, February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E-releases, [http://www.ereleases.com/prfuel/super-winners-and-losers/ "Super Winners and Losers"] ("The Patriots' coach was eviscerated by sports pundits for leaving the field before the game was actually finished.")&lt;/ref&gt; A bad winner acts in a shallow fashion after his or her victory, such as by gloating about his or her win, rubbing the win in the face(s) of the opponent(s), and lowering the opponent(s)'s [[self-esteem]] by constantly reminding the opponent(s) of "poor" performance in comparison (even if the opponent(s) competed well). Not showing respect to the other team is considered to being a bad sportsman and could lead to demoralising effects; as Leslie Howe describes: "If a pitcher in baseball decides to pitch not to his maximum ability suggest that the batter is not at an adequate level, [it] could lead to the batter to have low self-confidence or worth."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|title =Gamesmanship|last = Howe|first = Leslie|date = 2008|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|issue = 2|volume = 31 |pp=212–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six different categories relating to sportsmanship: the elements of sports, the elements of sportsmanship, clarifications, conflicts, balance and irreducibility.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; All six of these characterize a person with good sportsmanship. Even though there is some affinity between some of the categories, they are distinct elements.&lt;ref name="abad"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1080/17511320903365227#abstract|title = Sportsmanship|last = Abad|first = Diana|date = 2010|journal = Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|doi = 10.1080/17511320903365227|issue = 1|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In essence, play has for its directed and immediate end joy, pleasure, and delights and which is dominated by a spirit of moderation and generosity. Athletics, on the other hand, is essentially a competitive activity, which has for its end victory in the contest and which is characterized of dedication, sacrifice and intensity." (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3) Hence, the virtues of a player are radically different from the virtues of an athlete. (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3). When talking about misunderstanding sportsmanship, Rudd and Stoll (2013) provide an example from 1995, a U.S. high school athletic league banned the post-game handshake that was a part of sports such as football and basketball. The handshaking was banned because of fights that were ensuing after the handshake.(pp.&amp;nbsp;41) Most players are influenced by the leaders around them such as coaches and older players, ''if there are coaches and administrators who don't understand sportsmanship, then what about the players?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|title = Understanding Sportsmanship|last = Rudd; Stoll|first = Andrew; Sharon K|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|p=41|doi = 10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|volume = 69|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Sportmanship sculpture.jpg|thumb|A moment of sportmanship when [[John Landy]] helped [[Ron Clarke]] get up after he had fallen.]]

There are various ways that sportsmanship is practiced in different sports. Being a good sport often includes treating others as you would also like to be treated, cheer for good plays (even if it is made by the opposition), accept responsibility for your mistakes, and keep your perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachel|first1=Beverly|title=Scoring big: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play|journal=Current Health 2, a Weekly Reader Publication|date=2009|volume=35|issue=7|pages=16–20|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Scoring+big%3A+it%27s+not+whether+you+win+or+lose%2C+it%27s+how+you+play&amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Health+2%2C+a+Weekly+Reader+publication&amp;rft.au=Bachel%2C+Beverly&amp;rft.date=2009-03-01&amp;rft.pub=Weekly+Reader+Corp&amp;rft.issn=0163-156X&amp;rft.volume=35&amp;rft.issue=7&amp;rft.spage=16&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=194620867&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of treating others how you would like to be treated would include being respectful and polite to other team members and the opposition because in return you would also like to be treated the same way.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Cheer for good plays could include if in netball a player of the opposition made a good lead for the ball, which then resulted in a goal, everyone would either clap or make a supportive comment to acknowledge that what the player did was very well done. To accept responsibility for your mistakes will entail not placing the blame on other people.&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Some popular examples of good sportsmanship include shaking hands, help an opponent who may have fallen over, encourage everyone, cheer, clap or hi-five, and be respectful to everyone including teammates, the opposition, parents and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Josephson|first1=Michael|title=Ethics and sportsmanship (part I)|url=https://charactercounts.org/sports/Olympic/olympic-report-ethicssportsmanship.htm|website=Pursuing Victory with Honor|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly it is often encouraged and said regarding sportsmanship that "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Sportsmanship can be manifested in different ways depending on the game itself or the culture of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/concepts-of-sportsmanship-vary-across-cultures|title=Concepts of Sportsmanship Vary Across Cultures|first=Dustin|last=Petzold|date=|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

Sportsmanship can be affected by a few contributing factors such as the players' values and attitudes towards the sport and also the professional role models that are shown to the public. Role models in sport are expected to act in a moral and respectful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Carwyn|title=Drunken role models: Rescuing our sporting exemplars|journal=Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|date=2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=414–432|doi=10.1080/17511321.2011.561254}}&lt;/ref&gt; When elite sporting role models do not encourage sportsmanship this can also encourage people in society to act in similar ways to the athletes that they look up to and idolize. For example, if an individual looked up to an athlete who was drinking excessively, they may see this as acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; The direct correlation between sportsmanship and leadership is also considered to be another contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=M. S.|title=Creating an environment for sportsmanship outcomes: A systems perspective|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2006|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a positive environment in your sporting team will therefore create good sportsmanship from the individuals. Having a positive leadership by the captains, coaches and supporters would then encourage a positive sporting environment.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt;

'''Super Slow''' is a form of strengthening [[physical exercise]] ([[Strength training|resistance training]]) popularized by [[Ken Hutchins]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Ken. Super Slow: The ULTIMATE Exercise Protocol. Casselberry FL: Super Slow Systems, 1989, 1992. {{ISBN|0-9633199-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super Slow is Hutchins [[trademark]]ed name for the [[High intensity training]] approach advocated by [[Arthur Jones (inventor)|Arthur Jones]]. It is based on ideas from the 1940s and 1960s called 10/10 "muscle contraction with measured movement" and implemented using fixed weight [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]] machines. In more recent times such "Time Under Load" ideas have seen a renaissance with Dr Doug McGuff's best selling Body by Science.

The 10 second lifting, 10 second lowering repetition speed of movement was suggested to Ken Hutchins by Dr. Vincent Bocchicchio.  Bocchicchio promoted his original idea as being impractical on compound movements such as leg press, chest press, overhead press, and pull downs (chin-ups). However, Hutchins developed a turnaround technique to include those important exercises during [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]]-funded [[osteoporosis]] research at the [[University of Florida]] in the early 1980s. In addition, Hutchins improved the resistance curves of the exercise equipment and reduced their friction to further enhance the loading effect upon the muscles. The effect of this approach was further improved by the practice of the exercises in an "ideal" environment wherein the temperature was cool, ventilation was provided, and distractions (audio, smell, visual) were minimized. This clinical environment, in combination with the slow speed and improved mechanics, had never been managed before. SuperSlow instructors are also educated with an emphasis on using precise language in exercise.

A ten/ten protocol was used in the 1940s by body builders and later in the 1960s by powerlifters as a plateau breaker under the name MC/MM or ''muscle contraction with measured movement''. This similar idea was sometimes advocated by Bob Hoffman of the [[York Barbell]] Company. None of these earlier approaches incorporated the ideal environment, the consistent turnaround technique, the superior equipment mechanics, nor the adherence to tracking muscular function that SuperSlow encompassed.

The method incorporates very slow repetition speeds as compared to traditional resistance training methods, with emphasis on minimizing acceleration and momentum to reduce the force the body is exposed to during exercise and improve muscular loading.

SuperSlow [[workout]]s typically consist of one set of each exercise carried out to complete muscle fatigue. Hutchins recommends performing each set for between 100 and 240 seconds, depending on the exercise and the subject's competence. A frequency of twice weekly is recommended for most trainees, with even less frequency for more advanced trainees. A workout should last no longer than 30 minutes and be performed to the exclusion of all other intense activity for maximum progress. In recent years, Hutchins has continued to refine methods and expand publications to include additional training methodology and exercise history.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Ken. The Renaissance of Exercise. Casselberry FL: Renaissance Exercise, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Some research indicates that Super Slow produces superior results compared to traditional methods in as little as 10 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Westcott, WL et al. Effects of regular and slow speed resistance training on muscle strength. Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness. 41: 154-158, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow repetitions may be particularly beneficial to trainees working around injuries or conditions requiring extra caution and may be useful for practicing proper form when learning new exercises. Personal trainers who have abandoned Super Slow for general use may still use it as a method for teaching new exercises or evaluating clients' exercise form.

Similar methods include Fred Hahn's Slow Burn system and Adam Zickerman's Power of 10 method. Zickerman's Power of Ten is identical to Super Slow in rep speed and philosophy. Hahn's Slow Burn method does not subscribe to the strict 10/10 rep tempo, and uses a heavier weight load than Super Slow. In Slow Burn training, the weight load chosen renders muscle fatigue in 40–90 seconds. Hahn also recommends two sessions per week for the vast majority of trainees. The word ''burn'' in Slow Burn is used to describe efficient fat burning via the use of a low carbohydrate eating regimen, NOT the feeling of burning muscles while doing the exercises.

'''Supporters' groups''' or '''supporters' clubs''' are independent [[fan clubs]] or campaign groups in sport, mostly [[association football]].

Supporters' groups in [[continental Europe]] are generally known as [[ultras]] which derives from the [[Latin]] word ultrā,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ultra|title=the definition of ultra|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''beyond'' in English, with the implication that their enthusiasm is 'beyond' the normal. In English-speaking nations, these groups are generally known as "supporters' groups". Most groups in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia call themselves "supporters' groups", however some do self identify as ultras, particularly in communities with large Spanish, French, or Italian speaking populations. In Brazil, the organised [[torcida]] plays a similar role and in Mexico both the terms barras and porras are used. Groups in South America are called either [[Barra Brava]], [[Hinchada]] (this word was first used in [[Uruguay]]), [[Torcida]], or Fanaticada.

Supporters' groups and ultras are renowned for their fanatical vocal support in large groups, defiance of the authorities, and the display of banners at stadiums, which are used to create an atmosphere to intimidate opposing players and supporters, as well as encouraging their own team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supertifo.it/storia_tifo/INGLESE/storia_del_tifo.htm|title=supertifo.it|website=www.supertifo.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Supporters' groups are usually based around a core group (who tend to have executive control over the whole group), with smaller subgroups organised by location, friendship, or political stance. Supporters' groups tend to use various styles and sizes of banners and flags with the name and symbols of the group. Some supporters' groups sell their own merchandise such as scarves, hats, and jackets. The culture is a mix of several supporting styles, such as scarf-waving and chanting. A supporters group can number from a handful of fans to hundreds, and often claim entire sections of a stadium for themselves.

According to a writer for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', the four core points of the ultra mentality are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2836/&lt;/ref&gt;
* never stop singing or chanting during a match, no matter the result
* never sit down during a match
* attend as many games as possible (home and away), regardless of cost or distance
* loyalty to the stand in which the group is located

Supporters' groups usually have a [[Representation (politics)|representative]] who liaises with the club owners on a regular basis, mostly regarding tickets, seat allocations, and storage facilities. Some clubs provide the groups cheaper tickets, storage rooms for flags and banners, and early access to the stadium before matches to prepare the displays. Some have criticised these types of favoured relationships. Some spectators criticise supporters groups for never sitting during matches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2008/06/08/hunter08.ART_ART_06-08-08_C1_I7AEE69.html|title=Bob Hunter commentary: Fan behavior like this is what soccer needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for displaying banners and flags, which hinder the view of those sitting behind.

===Match day===
During matches of significant importance, many supporters' groups choreograph a large overhead display that is displayed just in the section of the stadium where the group is located or the entire stadium. Sometimes small sheets of plastic or paper are held aloft to form a pattern or to colour the stadium. Such a display is called a mosaic or card display. Other materials used in certain types of displays include balloons, streamers, huge banners, flares, smoke bombs, and some times giant dolls. Popular culture icons are often used on banners. Corporate brand logos and catchphrases are also often used. The displays, which can be expensive to make, often take months to prepare. All of the supporter-provided overhead displays, two-poles, banners, etc. are called [[tifo]].

Supporters groups tend to be highly vocal at matches, with each group having several [[football chant]]s. The melodies are mostly taken from popular songs.&lt;ref name="BBC News040511"&gt;{{cite news |title=Football's first Chant Laureate|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=11 May 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3702313.stm|accessdate=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooliganism===
Unlike [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firms]], whose main aim is to fight fans of other clubs, the main focus of supporters' groups is to support their own team. Hooligans usually try to be inconspicuous when they travel, usually not wearing team colours to avoid detection by the police.&lt;ref name="Milo-BristolCity"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lowles | first = Nick |author2=[[Andy Nicholls]]  | title = Hooligans: A-L of Britain's Football Gangs | publisher = Milo Books | year = 2005 | location = [[Wrea Green]] | isbn = 1-903854-41-5 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, supporters' groups tend to be more conspicuous when they travel and like to arrive ''en masse'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundersfc.com/Matchday/March-to-the-Match.aspx March to the Match&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the police to keep a close eye on their movements. Although supporters' groups can become violent, the vast majority of matches go ahead with no violent incidents. In the United States, the sport has been traditionally viewed as a family-friendly event, and hooliganism among supporters groups is virtually unheard of.

The Bulldogs Army is the core support group for the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]], with the section they sit within known as 'The Kennel'. To be sitting in this section, supporters must become a member of the club itself and register any large flags and/or banners which are brought to the game. At all away games the Bulldogs Army locates themselves in the general admission section. The main aim of the Bulldogs Army is to show support and passion for the Bulldogs.

As the region's traditional local representatives, the Bulldogs predominantly draw on a support base in and around the suburbs of [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] in [[south-western Sydney]], although in recent years club administration and home matches have relocated to [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. The Bulldogs are the most supported NRL club in regional NSW – over 25% of Bulldog fans are located in regional NSW, over 25% are located outside of NSW and over 10% are located in QLD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=membership-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020022627/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=membership-2011 |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club has one of the highest average attendances in the league: over the [[National Rugby League season 2010|2010 season]], it was one of only two clubs to record an average home crowd of more than 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2010.html|title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances 2010 / Canterbury|accessdate=14 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607084350/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2010.html|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multicultural demographics of the suburbs in the club's support base, such as [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]], means the club has a large number of supporters from a range of non-Anglo ethnicities. In recent years the club has become particularly identified in the media with the Lebanese and the Greek community, particularly with the club's former star goalkicker [[Hazem El Masri]], being a Lebanese immigrant who migrated from Lebanon as a young child. The Greek community has a huge history of Greeks playing for the club dating back to the 1970s with club legend [[George Peponis]], being a Greek immigrant who migrated from Greece as a very young child who captained the Bulldogs and Australia. El Masri retired at the end of the 2009 season.

The [[Melbourne Storm]]'s supporter base grew from almost 500,000 in 2004 to almost 800,000 in 2009, making them the fourth most popular rugby team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Sydney Roosters]] have a strong support base across Australia. Aside from its traditional fan base in Sydney, which is most concentrated in its homeland in the affluent eastern suburbs, the club is also popular in [[South East Queensland]], [[Canberra]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/fans/roostersaustraliawide.php  |title=Roosters Australia Wide |publisher=Sydney Roosters |accessdate=9 August 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060709080241/http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/fans/roostersaustraliawide.php |archivedate = 9 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club has an internet message board for supporters, "The Wall", which has been the official forum since 1999.

In 2013 the club tallied the fourth-highest home attendance of all National Rugby League clubs (behind the [[Brisbane Broncos]]) with an average of 19,368 spectators at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].&lt;ref name="attendance"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2013.html | title=Rugby League Tables / 2013 Attendances | publisher=Rugby League Tables &amp; Statistics | accessdate=9 November 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109052306/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2013.html | archivedate=9 November 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the club's home ground, the Sydney Football Stadium, the supporters congregate in distinct sections.

There are also a number of English supporters' groups located in Australia for premiership teams and championship teams. The Hornets Down Under&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com.au|title=Welcome to the Hornets Down Under website|website=www.watfordfc.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an example of a championship supporters' group.

===Latin America===
In Latin America supporter groups are usually called ''[[barra brava|barras bravas]]''. Similar to the European [[ultras]], the phenomenon originated in [[Argentina]] in the 1950s, but it has spread throughout the Americas during the following decades.

The groups wield enormous power and influence over football in their respective states, especially in Argentina where there are the largest and strongest organised supporter groups in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html|title=Los hooligans más peligrosos del mundo están en Argentina|trans-title=The most dangerous hooligans of the world are in Argentina|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=10 October 2007|first=Enrique López|last=Magallón|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception is Brazil, where the clubs have active supporter groups named ''[[torcida organizada|torcidas organizadas]]'', who play a similar role to the ''barras bravas''. However, the southern part of Brazil, in the south part of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and in all [[Rio Grande do Sul]], contrary to the rest of the country, the supporter groups are ''barras bravas''. In turn, in [[Mexico]] both the terms ''barras'' and ''porras'' are used.

===Continental Europe===
In Europe, there are primarily three types of groups: official supporter groups, [[ultras]], and [[hooligan firms]].

Official supporter groups primary function is to liaise with the club board and protects supporter interest as well as have a say in the running of the clubs, and they usually represent all types of supporters of all ages ranging from fanatical supporters, to disabled supporters, to supporters who rarely frequent games, however they are still an independent body. The oldest of witch is Torcida founded in 1950 as supporters of Hajduk Split from Croatia.
[[File:Nice celebrating the victory of France in 2018 football cup.jpg|thumb|right|Nice celebrating the victory of France in 2018 football cup]]

[[Ultras]] groups are independent of the club however they too are frequently supported by the club as they cater to the majority of the most vocal and committed supporters, producing atmosphere and encouraging the players. However, frequent tensions also arise, due to often vocal and pro-active criticism of management or players and the illegality of some their actions, such as [[graffiti]] and lighting [[pyrotechnics]] during matches. Many ultras groups to maintain their independence and raise money, run their own shops selling supporter merchandise, most commonly clothing, [[Football scarf|supporter scarves]], and sometimes in collaboration with the club match tickets.

[[Hooligan firms]] are largely restricted to a secretive [[sub-culture]], due to the illegal nature of their activity. Hooligans mostly socialise and interact with other hooligans, and therefore have little contact with other sets of supporters.

In the past, the distinction between ultras and [[hooligans]] was blurred, with the majority being considered both. Due to the increase in condemnation and punishment of hooligan activity, the divide has become increasingly visible, however for some groups, especially groups who support smaller teams and therefore have less members, this divide is still very much blurred; some groups have started using the label ''hooltras''.

===Britain and Ireland===
Most supporters' groups are officially endorsed by the affiliated club, recognised on the club's website and holds meetings at the stadium.

'''Swing timing''' is concerned with the inter-relationships between [[Ball game|ball sports]] hitting implements and the related anatomical parts of players, in the [[motor skill]] of striking sports balls as used in various games.

More specifically, swing timing commonly refers to the efficiency of ball hitting or kicking skills by achieving optimum power at instant of ball impact. Furthermore, swing timing also refers to the inter-relationship between optimum power as generated and the intended point of ball contact.

Perfect swing timing is therefore achieved when ball is struck with optimum power, with least energy expenditure, and at contact point that achieves the desired direction and velocity of ball after impact.

Of all the motor skill components essential for expert ball play, swing timing is the most difficult to acquire, and teach, because of the essential millisecond co-ordination of major and minor muscle groups to impart optimal progressive acceleration to the hitting implement until it has reached greatest velocity and optimum angle at moment of ball impact.

Arguably the best ball players have superior swing timing to achieve greatest ball impact velocities for greatest speed and/or distance, and a highly tuned [[muscle memory]], or ‘feel’, to more consistently repeat or adjust swing as determined by the changing success requirements which vary from one ‘shot’ to another, and the ability to fine-tune swing velocity and impact point and angle.

The answer still eluding even top teaching professionals; be it in golf, tennis, baseball, racketball, squash, cricket and even ball-kicking sports including European, American and [[Australian rules football|Australian football]], and rugby; is how to more effectively teach correct swing timing, the essence of the ‘perfect swing technique’.

Some common and fairly accurate perceptions of correct Swing Timing include a relaxed posture and muscle groups, which are only called into action in precisely timed intervals, and which relax instantly after ball contact is made; and an apparent ‘80% Only’ effort, which appears to promote the desired relaxed state during the whole swing.

But the inability to more accurately observe these split-second, highly complex correlations and co-ordination; therefore, more often than not, encourages the teaching of specific and isolated swing components only, which tends to disrupt ‘natural’ swing mechanics and timing rather than enhancing these.

For this reason, correct swing timing, still remains confined to [[trial and error]] techniques, where the naturally gifted player eliminates errors more quickly, and acquires accurate muscle memory faster.

As visual feedback of actual swing remains elusive, an increasingly popular technique is to focus on correct swing rhythm, which can be more easily internalized, thereby accelerating essential muscle memory. Therefore one of the most effective teaching and practice tools is music, where the rhythm of music and ‘perfect swing’ are identical for a given player. In this method there is a more identifiable correlation of actual swing versus ideal by the degree of synchronization achieved.

Other audio and tactile swing timing feedback devices have already been developed. These devices have proven to be highly effective in teaching ‘near perfect swing timing’ even to youngsters in a natural play learning experience.

==Swing timing versus swing rhythm==
In the existing related literature, these two terms are freely interchanged. Yet it appears that failure to recognize the key difference is another reason for the difficulty in their understanding, and thereby the difficulty in achieving correct swing mechanics, timing and rhythm.

Whereas swing timing is pertinent to the sequence of vital swing components coming into effect for optimum ball contact, Swing rhythm is the tempo of the complete swing, which traditionally includes the backswing, and a vital pause between backswing and final swing towards ball impact.

In swing timing the emphasis is therefore on the correct sequence of the various elements of the total swing. Whereas in swing rhythm the focus is on the tempo, and relative 'weight' of each component within that tempo of the ideal personal swing.

Focus on swing rhythm, either in teaching or personal practice, is considered preferable. Correct swing rhythm results in faster 'feel' of correct timing mechanics, and reduces interference with that vital process by eliminating risk of undue emphasis on individual components of the total swing. To achieve perfect swing timing in this approach, it only remains to fine-tune this rhythm to ensure that the 'down beat' coincides perfectly with ball impact.

==Progressive segmental acceleration==
It is more important to understand this rhythm aspect of swing timing, then to focus on its individual components. And regardless of which sports specific skill, this concept remains constant. First, movement occurs in the most distal of the total swing lever system and progressively moves to each component one increment closer to the final impact point. And this movement sequence is common for tennis, golf, baseball and similar hitting skills. First the knees, which initiate rotation and forward movement of hips, which in turn initiate upper trunk and shoulder rotation, before progressively bringing upper and lower arms into play, followed by wrist and fingers which impart the final control and speed to the club, racket or stick. For ultimate success it is equally important that perfect swing timing occurs in the correct Swing Plane as determined by anticipated ball contact point, intended direction of ball flight, and the desired spin effect to be imparted to ball.

[[Mathematical model]]s can easily demonstrated the effect on racket or clubhead velocity, for each swing component which is subject to exponential acceleration caused by the cumulative effect of all prior components in the total acceleration chain. In simple terminology and concept, this complex action and its effect is comparable to cracking a whip. It is therefore self-evident that if any one component is out of ideal swing synchronization, the resultant detrimental impact will be a similarly [[Exponential growth|exponential increase]] in loss of power and direction at ball impact.

While this is an appropriate model for better understanding of the biomechanics and kinesiology involved in perfect swing timing; it is not an ideal basis for teaching same. It is simply too complex for anyone to consciously synchronize all the component in this chain, especially in only the fraction of a second available to complete this final swing sequence; or indeed observe it or feel each individual component coming into play sequentially.  Thus tempo and rhythm, still remain as the key variables in the achievement of correct swing timing.

Therefore any theory of correct swing timing, in practice and teaching, must rely on correct swing rhythm emphasis, including learning, teaching and practice devices that provide instant feedback of correct swing rhythm for every swing.

==Controversy==
The importance of the pause of the hitting implement at the end of the backswing, that is, ''before'' the actual swing aimed at perfect swing timing is commenced; is generally agreed upon, regardless of sport. This Pause is the moment of final deliberation as to when to commence a hitchless and optimum swing. Many swing timing problems can thus be traced back to miscalculations during this critical split-second pause. The continuing 'traditional' emphasis on correct backswing check points, arcs and planes, therefore appears to be seriously misplaced,  and simply adds to the overall complexity of Swing Timing.

It would therefore also appear that only two things are important in any backswing instructions, First, that the racket or clubhead pauses in the correct place on the desired swing arc and plane as determined by the intended 'shot', and secondly, that the racket or club face has assumed the optimal angle relative to swing arc and plane, so as to require minimal further adjustment in the Final Swing Sequence, and thereby eliminating another adjustment variable and potential cause of error.

The achievement of correct swing timing therefore remains over-complicated by breaking down a swing that needs to be continuous and rhythmic, into its sub-components. Instead it can and should be 'discovered' much more easily through an emphasis on correct swing rhythm in ways already described.

The format of "The System" has provoked much debate among Gaelic football analysts. Former [[Derry GAA|Derry]] footballer and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] analyst [[Joe Brolly]], after watching Donegal overpower his county's team in the 2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship, wrote a column prophesying an All-Ireland win for Donegal due to the team being, he concluded, "virtually unbeatable". He was proven correct when Donegal retained the Ulster Senior Football Championship they had won the previous year before going on to win the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] for the first time in twenty years. Brolly proposed at the time that Donegal were capable of swallowing entire teams into a vacuum. Keith Duggan—writing in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' after the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final—contested this notion, instead proposing that teams encountering Donegal had fallen apart due to their own weaknesses and that Donegal had merely exploited this. However, Duggan acknowledged that Donegal had "expanded the possibilities" of Gaelic football.&lt;ref name=fearless_shift_axis_of_power&gt;{{cite news|first=Keith|last=Duggan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0929/1224324605134.html|title=Fearless Donegal ready to shift axis of power|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=29 September 2012|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under "The System", players whose careers were thought to be behind them have been revived. Players such as [[Ryan Bradley (Gaelic footballer)|Ryan Bradley]] and [[Anthony Thompson (Gaelic footballer)|Anthony Thompson]] emerged as if from nowhere. The top teams in Gaelic football—[[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] and [[Cork GAA|Cork]], who had dominated the sport over the previous decade—have been made to appear merely ordinary, and have been swatted aside with relative ease.

Traditional Gaelic football formations are rendered redundant under The System. A corner-back such as [[Frank McGlynn]]—who had never scored a point in his Championship career before scoring 1–4 in 2012—has been turned into ruthless attacking players, while corner-forwards—the traditional scorers—contribute to the team's overall defensive efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/allireland-final-donegal-v-mayo-croke-park-330-3237031.html|title=All-Ireland Final: Donegal v Mayo, Croke Park, 3.30|newspaper=Sunday Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable successes==
The System was successfully used by Donegal to win the [[2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship]], the [[2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship]] and the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. Donegal's comprehensive defeat of [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in their 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final meeting was described by the national media as "the most seismic result in [Kerry] since the 1987 Munster final replay defeat to Cork".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keys|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/house-that-jack-built-in-danger-of-collapse-3190890.html|title=House that Jack built in danger of collapse|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final against Cork, nobody outside the county gave Donegal a chance, and Cork went into the game as heavy favourites to win the title itself—even though this was only the semi-final. Donegal deployed The System to devour the heavily fancied Cork team and progressed to their first title decider since 1992.&lt;ref name=league_of_their_own&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary|last=Hannigan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0827/1224323032489.html|title=Donegal may be in a league of their own, but no it's not rugby|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=27 August 2012|quote=Over on BBC Northern Ireland they were no less befuddled...

"Well?” asked Austin, but his guests didn't really know where – or how – to start.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrone's three-time All-Ireland winning manager [[Mickey Harte]], attempting to analyse the game for the [[BBC]], expressed his shock: "To be honest, I could not see that coming. Donegal annihilated Cork, there is no other word for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/19371945|title=Donegal annihilate Cork in All-Ireland Football semi-final|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=26 August 2012|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donegal then unleashed The System on [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]], rendering them motionless with two early goals and keeping them scoreless for the first sixteen minutes of the match. The first goal occurred in the third minute of the game when Donegal captain [[Michael Murphy (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Murphy]] lashed the ball into the net, having collected a high ball delivered by [[Karl Lacey]]. ''[[Championship Matters]]'' named it "Goal of the Championship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldaily.com/2012/09/27/ddtv-video-murphy-strike-against-mayo-named-goal-of-the-championship/|title=DDTV Video: Murphy strike against Mayo named Goal of the Championship|work=Donegal Daily|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleventh minute [[Patrick McBrearty]]'s attempt at scoring a point came crashing off the Mayo post.

==Views of opponents==
Cork's [[Donncha O'Connor]] said of Donegal in 2012, "Every fella knows what the next fella's going to do. It's probably a bit dangerous if you're concentrating on what Donegal do, but it's just that they have a system.

[[Pat Spillane]] famously branded Donegal's style of play "Shi'ite football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/local-sport/beware-of-praise-from-outside-conaghan-1-3971612|title=Beware of praise from outside – Conaghan|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|publisher=Johnston Press|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised Jim McGuinness during the early development of The System—"There are people who go to the Hague for war crimes – I tell you this, some of the coaches nowadays should be up for crimes against Gaelic football".&lt;ref name=league_of_their_own/&gt; Less than a year before McGuinness led his team to All-Ireland success, [[Vincent Hogan]] branded him "a leader of sheep" in a famous newspaper article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McGuinness a leader of sheep |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/vincent-hogan/vincent-hogan-mcguinness-a-leader-of-sheep-2940524.html |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=21 November 2011 |first=Vincent |last=Hogan |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/local-sport/sheep-jibe-was-not-welcomed-1-3274387 |first1=Alan |last1=Foley |first2=Tom |last2=Comack |title=‘Sheep’ jibe was not welcomed |work=[[Donegal Democrat]] |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==View of McGuinness==
After defeat to Mayo in 2013 McGuinness said: {{quote|Our system is exactly the same every single year. It was the same in 2010 when we were with the under-21s. And that is the reason why we won the All Ireland in 2012. We'll go back and we'll identify all the things that we're talking about here to day – injuries, hunger for the game, what would we have done better ourselves, what could we have got right in terms of the whole season and of the game today. And once we've done all that, we'll know a lot more about the situation. That would normally take two to three weeks. On the back of 2011 we knew we had to go more offensive. That's why we didn't get over the line in 2011 and we put a huge emphasis on the attacking side of the game in 2012 to get us over the line. And it was that analysis that brought us over the line last year. That whole process has to happen again now. To me, it only makes sense at the end of a cycle to look at where you went right and where you went wrong and see what you would have changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Seán|last=Moran|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/jimmy-promises-to-find-out-why-he-s-no-longer-winning-matches-1.1484577|title=Jimmy promises to find out why he's no longer winning matches|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=5 August 2013|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Women's sports''' includes [[amateur sports|amateur]] as well as [[women's professional sports]], in all varieties of [[sports]]. Female participation and popularity in sports increased dramatically in the twentieth century, especially in the last quarter-century, reflecting changes in modern societies that emphasized [[gender]] parity. Although the level of participation and performance still varies greatly by [[country]] and by [[Sports|sport]], [[women]]'s sports are widely accepted throughout the world today. In a few instances, such as [[figure skating]], female athletes rival or exceed their [[male]] counterparts in popularity. In many sports women usually do not compete on equal terms against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ross Tucker, The Science of Sport |url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2010/04/let-male-and-female-compete-together.html |title=Let male and female compete together &amp;#124; The Science of Sport |publisher=SportsScientists.com |date=2010-04-15 |access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has been a rise in participation by women in sports, a large disparity still remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/ |title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport |date=2016-02-26 |newspaper=The Sport Journal |access-date=2017-02-08 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities are prevalent globally and continue to hinder equality in sports. Many institutions and programs still remain conservative and do not contribute to gender equity in sports.

==History==

===Ancient civilizations===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Villa romana bikini girls.JPG|thumb|Roman women engaged in sports. [[Mosaic]] at the [[Villa del Casale|Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]]]]
[[File:Greek Runner Maiden 2.png|thumb|A statue of a victress of the Heraean Games, represented near the start of a race]]
Before each [[ancient Olympic Games]] there was a separate women's athletic event held at the same stadium in Olympia, the [[Heraean Games]],  dedicated to the goddess [[Hera]]. Myth held that the Heraea was founded by [[Hippodameia]], the wife of the king who founded the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite web |author=Scanlon, Thomas F. |title=Games for Girls |work="Ancient Olympics Guide" |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/olympics/girls.html |access-date=February 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to E. Norman Gardiner:

{{Quote| At the festival there were races for maidens of various ages. Their course was 500 feet, or one-sixth less than the men's stadium. The maidens ran with their hair down their backs, a short tunic reaching just below the knee, and their right shoulder bare to the breast. The victors received crowns of olive and a share of the heifer sacrificed to Hera. They had, too, the right of setting up their statues in the Heraeum.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, E. Norman, 'The Rise of the Athletic Festival' in ''Greek Athletic Sport and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Although married women were excluded from the Olympics even as spectators, [[Cynisca]] won an Olympic game as owner of a chariot (champions of chariot races were owners not riders), as did [[Euryleonis]], [[Belistiche]], [[Polycrates of Argos|Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione]], Timareta, Theodota and Cassia.

After the classical period, there was some participation by women in men's athletic festivals.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt; Women in Sparta began to practice the same athletic exercises that men did, exhibiting the qualities of Spartan soldiers. Plato even supported women in sports by advocating running and sword-fighting for women.&lt;ref&gt;Swaddling, Judith. The Ancient Olympic Games. Austin: U of Texas, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, cultural representations of a pronounced female physicality were not limited to sport in Ancient Greece and can also be found in representations of a group of warrioresses known as the [[Amazons]].

===Early modern===
During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, women played in professional [[Cuju]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/index02.html |title=Cuju – Ancient Chinese Football |author= |date= |work=Cultural-China.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/ |title=Cuju – Ancient Chinese Football |author= |date= |work=Cultural-China.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chujutu.jpg|thumb|Chinese ladies playing ''cuju'', by the [[Ming Dynasty]] painter [[Du Jin]]]] The first Olympic games in the modern era, which were in 1896 were not open to women, but since then the number of women who have participated in the Olympic games have increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Olympic.org |title=Women and Sport Commission |url=http://www.olympic.org/women-sport-commission |work=Olympic.org |access-date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th and early 20th centuries===
The educational committees of the [[French Revolution]] (1789) included intellectual, moral, and physical education for both girls and boys. With the victory of Napoleon less than twenty years later, physical education was reduced to military preparedness for boys and men. In Germany, the physical education of [[GutsMuths]] (1793) included girl's education. This included the measurement of performances of girls. This led to women's sport being more actively pursued in Germany than in most other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (2003): ''Germany'', in: [[James Riordan]] &amp; [[Arnd Krüger]] (eds.): ''European Cultures in Sport. Examining the Nations and Regions''. Bristol: Intellect 2003, pp. 57 – 88.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]] was formed as an all women's international organization it had a German male vice-president in addition to German international success in elite sports.

Women's sports in the late 1800s focused on correct posture, facial and bodily beauty, muscles, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Padgett |first1=Jessica |title=The Issues of Women in Sport |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/sports02/papers/jpadgett.html |website=Serendip Studio |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1870, activities for women were recreational rather than sport-specific in nature. They were noncompetitive, informal, rule-less; they emphasized physical activity rather than competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Richard |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |website=The Sport Journal |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports for women before the 20th century placed more emphasis on fitness rather than the competitive aspects we now associate with all sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |date=2008-03-14 |newspaper=The Sport Journal |access-date=2017-02-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) held its first national championship for women (in swimming),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWmCWO6SpsYC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=In+1916+the+Amateur+Athletic+Union+(AAU)+held+its+first+national+championship+for+women.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Xh1YQtV58&amp;sig=Ec4urY3ZtRZHwkwG708ffcsqIh8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2v5WZ1vnRAhUH92MKHZBaCogQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201916%20the%20Amateur%20Athletic%20Union%20(AAU)%20held%20its%20first%20national%20championship%20for%20women.&amp;f=false |title=Outstanding Women Athletes: Who They are and how They Influenced Sports in America |last=Woolum |first=Janet |date=1998-01-01 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=9781573561204 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the AAU also sponsored the [[1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|First American Track &amp; Field championships for women]]. Earlier that year the [[Women's Amateur Athletic Association]] (WAAA) held [[1923 WAAA Championships|the first WAAA Championships]].

Few women competed in sports in Europe and North America before the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as social changes favored increased female participation in society as equals with men. Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.

"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world." [[Susan B. Anthony]] said "I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance."

The modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.&lt;ref&gt;"Equality for Women in the Olympics." Feminist Majority Foundation. Web. November 2014. http://www.feminist.org/sports/olympics.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the IOC-Congress in Paris 1914 a woman's medal had formally the same weight as a man's in the official medal table. This left the decisions about women's participation to the individual international sports federations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]: Forgotton Decisions. The IOC on the Eve of World War I, in: ''Olympika'' 6 (1997), 85 – 98. &lt;http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1997/olympika0601g.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over the physical strength and stamina of women led to the discouragement of female participation in more physically intensive sports, and in some cases led to less physically demanding female versions of male sports.  Thus [[netball]] was developed out of [[basketball]] and [[softball]] out of [[baseball]].

In response to the lack of support for women's international sport the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]] was founded in France by [[Alice Milliat]]. This organization initiated the Women's Olympiad (held [[1921 Women's Olympiad|1921]], [[1922 Women's Olympiad|1922]] and [[1923 Women's Olympiad|1923]]) and the [[Women's World Games]], which attracted participation of nearly 20 countries and was held four times ([[1922 Women's World Games|1922]], [[1926 Women's World Games|1926]], [[1930 Women's World Games|1930]] and [[1934 Women's World Games|1934]]).&lt;ref name="LeighBonin"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leigh |first=Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Thérèse M. |title=The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |publisher=North American Society for Sport History |year=1977 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924 the [[1924 Women's Olympiad]] was held at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in [[London]]. The [[International Olympic Committee]] began to incorporate greater participation of [[women at the Olympics]] in response. The number of Olympic women athletes increased over five-fold in the period, going from 65 at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] to 331 at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/antwerp-1920-summer-olympics Antwerp 1920]. IOC. Retrieved on 2014-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/berlin-1936-summer-olympics Berlin 1936]. IOC. Retrieved on 2014-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early women's professional sports leagues foundered.  This is often attributed to a lack of spectator support.  Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.

In 1972, the United States government implemented [[Title IX]], a law stating that any federally funded program cannot discriminate anyone based on their sex.&lt;ref name="Empowering Women in Sports"&gt;{{cite web |first=Femenist Majority Foundation |title=Empowering Women in Sports |url=http://www.feminist.org/research/sports/sports12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation by women in sports increased dramatically after its introduction, amid fears that this new law would jeopardize men's sports programs.&lt;ref name="Empowering Women in Sports"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Judith E. |title=Getting into the Game: Women and Sports |year=1997 |publisher=Franklin Watts |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title IX has had a significant impact on athletics at the high school and collegiate level for female students. "In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education. In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Barbara |title=The Impact of Title IX |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/impact-title-ix |website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the implementation of Title IX, many high schools and colleges still have huge gender disparities based on sports. According to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011,4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title  IX laws.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wong, A. (2015, June 26). Where Girls Are Missing Out on High-School Sports. Retrieved January 23, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/06/girls-high-school-sports-inequality/396782/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to further research done by the Women's Law Center, schools with high number of minority students and a greater number of people of color mainly in southern states had a much higher rate of gender disparity. There is also a huge disparity regarding sport related scholarships for men and women, with men getting 190 million more in funding than women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Wallace, K. (2016, March 14). The real March Madness: When will women's teams get equal buzz?

This disparity shows the link between race and gender, and how it plays a significant role in the hierarchy of sports.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1990, [[Bernadette Mattox]] became the first female Division I coach of a men's basketball team, serving as an assistant at the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]]. A year later, goaltender Jenny Hanley of [[Hamline University]] became the first women to play on a men's college ice hockey team.&lt;ref name="Part 6- 1990-1997"&gt;{{cite web |first=History of Women in sports timeline |title=Part 6- 1990–1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, the number of females playing sports in high school had increased threefold since Title IX was implemented, and ground was broken for the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]], the first such hall of fame devoted exclusively to female athletes (though men can be, and have been, inducted in non-playing roles). In 1996 the number of female high school athletes reached 2.4 million, including 819 football players, 1164 wrestlers, and 1471 ice hockey players.&lt;ref name="Part 6- 1990-1997"/&gt;

====Canada====

{{main|History of Canadian women}}
Sports are a high priority in Canadian culture, but women were long relegated to second-class status. There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine "girls rule" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the "new women" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ann Hall, ''The Girl and the Game: A History of Women's Sport in Canada'' (Broadview Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has produced a range of major international sports including: association football, rugby (union and league), cricket, netball, darts, golf, tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, bowls, rounders, modern rowing, hockey, boxing, snooker, billiards, and curling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nauright |first1=John |last2=Parrish |first2=Charles |title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781598843019 |pages=169.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, women primarily participated in the "new games" which included golf, lawn tennis, cycling, and hockey. Now, women also participate at a professional/international level in football, rugby, cricket, and netball.

Since the late 1980s, Women In Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Women In Sport |url=https://www.womeninsport.org |website=Women In Sport |publisher=Charities Commission |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization, has hoped to transform sport for the benefit of women and girls in the UK. Based in London, the organization's mission is to "champion the right of every woman and girl in the UK to take part in, and benefit from, sport: from the field of play to the boardroom, from early years and throughout her life".

===21st century===

For the first time ever rugby sevens was included as an Olympic sport at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/australia-wins-first-ever-womens-rugby-sevens-gold-medal |title=Australia wins first-ever women’s rugby sevens gold medal |newspaper=NBC Olympics |access-date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's finals included both Australia and New Zealand with Australia winning the first Olympic gold medal with a 24–17 victory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 2016 Rio Olympic Games was the first time women participated in rugby.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |first1=International Olympic Committee |title=Rugby: History of Rugby at the Olympic Games |url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/Factsheets-Reference-Documents/Games/OG/History-of-sports/Reference-document-Rugby-History-at-the-OG.pdf |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugby was first played by men until the sport was taken out of the Olympics in 1924.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==United States: Title IX==
===Implementation and regulation===
In 1972 the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Title IX legislation as a part of the additional Amendment Act to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiner |first=Andy |title=A Sporting Chance: Sports and Genders |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IX states that: "no person shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance...";&lt;ref name="Greenburg_1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenburg |first=Judith. E |title=Getting into the Game: Women and Sports |year=1997 |publisher=Franklin Watts |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, Title IX prohibits gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funds through grants, scholarships, or other support for students. The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coakley |first=Jay |title=Sports in Society |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.&lt;ref name="Greenburg_1997"/&gt; In practice, the difficulty{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} with Title IX is making sure schools are compliant with the law. In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the "three-part test". 
# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are "substantially proportionate" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.
# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).
# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.
Although schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, many schools have not managed to achieve equality. Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irons |first=Alicia |title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX |journal=Major Themes in Economics |date=Spring 2006 |url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf |access-date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Information |url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information |access-date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through implementation, Title IX provides equal opportunities for female students and athletes. However, Title IX did not fully define how governance will take place in regard to sports. Most sport teams or institutions, regardless of gender, are managed by male coaches and managers. This lack of women is because many institutions prefer a dominant male presence in order to preserve the traditional masculinity hegemony present in institutions and professional leagues, in relation to sports.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The societal norm of masculinity in connection to sports has hindered the growth of leaders in sports.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} According to 2016 data, 33% of WNBA teams are led by women coaches or managers.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/ |title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport |author=Senne |date=February 26, 2016 |work=TheSportJournal.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Olympic Committee also consists of 20% female members.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"/&gt; The data presented also showed that 15% of athletic directors in colleges nationwide were females, and that number is much less in the southern states.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"/&gt; Although Title IX was a breakthrough for women regarding funding and sport itself, the main goal is far from achieved. The disparity of men and women sport is prevalent and a significant one at that. The more alarming instance is the lack of female leadership in the sports world. The disparity will persist if the gap within leadership it not first fixed.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}

===Effect on women's sports===
The main objective of Title IX is to make sure there is equal treatment in sports and school, regardless of sex, in a federally funded program. It was also used to provide protection to those who are being discriminated due to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=The United States Department of Judgement |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/titleix.php |access-date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Title IX is most commonly associated with its impact on athletics and more specifically the impact it has had on women's participation in athletics at every age. Today{{When|date=April 2017}} there are more females participating in athletics than ever before. As of the 2007–2008 school year, females made up 41% of the participants in college athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Athletic Statistics |url=http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |accessdate=February 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114061928/http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see the growth of women's sports, consider the difference in participation before the passing of Title IX and today. In 1971–1972 there were 294,015 females participating in high school athletics and in 2007–2008 there were over three million females participating, meaning there has been a 940% increase in female participation in high school athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1971–1972 there were 29,972 females participating in college athletics and in 2007–2008 there were 166,728 females participating, a 456% increase in female participation in college athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1971, less than 300,000 females played in high school sports. After the law was passed many females started to get involved in sports. By 1990, eighteen years later, 1.9 million female high school students were playing sports.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"/&gt; Increased participation in sports has had a direct impact on other areas of women's lives; these effects can be seen in women's education and employment later on in life; a 2010 study found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women's education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women.&lt;ref name="parker1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker-Pope |first=Tara |title=As Girls Become Women, Sports Pay Dividends |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/health/16well.html |publisher=New York Times |access-date=February 16, 2012 |date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that all women who are successful later on in life played sports, but it is saying that women who did participate in athletics received benefits in their education and employment later on in life.&lt;ref name="parker1"/&gt;

In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team, (2) volleyball, 95.7%, (3) soccer, 92.0%, (4) cross country, 90.8%, and (5) softball, 89.2%. Since 1972, women have also competed in the traditional male sports of wrestling, weightlifting, rugby, and boxing. An article in the ''New York Times'' found that there are lasting benefits for women from Title IX: participation in sports increased education as well as employment opportunities for girls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Furthermore, the athletic participation by girls and women spurred by Title IX was associated with lower obesity rates. No other public health program can claim similar success.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Winslow |first=Barbara |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/impact-title-ix |title=The Impact of Title IX &amp;#124; The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |publisher=Gilderlehrman.org |date= |access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"However, as part of the backlash against the women's movement, opposition quickly organized against Title IX. Worried about how it would affect men's athletics, legislators and collegiate sports officials became concerned and looked for ways to limit its influence. One argument was that revenue-producing sports such as college football should be exempted from Title IX compliance. Another was that in order for schools and colleges to comply, they would have to cut men's sports such as wrestling. Others argued that federal legislation was not the way to achieve equality or even parity. Finally, conservative opponents of women's rights believed that feminists used Title IX as an all-purpose vehicle to advance their agenda in the schools. Since 1975, there have been twenty court challenges to Title IX in an attempt to whittle down greater gender equity in all fields of education—mirroring the ups and downs of the women's movement at large. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, female students received 1.3 million fewer opportunities to participate in high school athletics than their male peers in the 2006–2007 school years. Yet as a result of Title IX, women have benefited from involvement in amateur and professional sports and, in turn, sports are more exciting with their participation."&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt;

In October 2018 Iran announced that, after 40 years, it will allow women to enter sport arenas&lt;ref&gt;[https://dailytimes.com.pk/312207/football-stadium-politics/ Football stadium politics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2012 London Olympics]] were the first games of their kind in which women competed in every sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/london-2012-is-this-the-womens-olympics |title=London 2012: was this the women's Olympics? – Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=2012-08-12 |access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight for women to gain equality on national levels and in professional leagues, in terms of pay and better funding, has continued; however sports still remain dominated by men, financially and globally. Gender remains a selective and primary factor in terms of determining if women are able-bodied as men and if they should get the same treatment in terms of sports.&lt;ref&gt;Henne, K. (2014). The "Science" of Fair Play in Sport: Gender and the Politics of Testing. ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture &amp; Society'', ''39''(3), 787–812.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often said{{By whom|date=April 2017}} that sports are a thing for men, and has become a stereotypical notion within society. Negative gender-based characteristics such as masculinity and femininity have been described as the deciding factor in order to play sports, and has often been held as justifiable dismissing sports equity.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, R., Farquharson, K., &amp; Marjoribanks, T. (2015). Sport and Social Inequalities. ''Sociology Compass'', ''9''(5), 400–411. doi:10.1111/soc4.12254&lt;/ref&gt;

The pay gap in women sports is a controversial and significant issue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Women athletes, in their respective fields, get paid far less than their male counterparts, and this has been the standard for a long period of time. The difference between the American men's and women's soccer teams' salaries serves as an example regarding pay inequality. Taking into consideration the revenues generated by the sport itself and the accomplishments of the athletes, the disparity in pay is extremely overwhelming.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Women on the U.S national team earned $99,000 per year, while men earned $263,320 if they were to win 20 exhibition matches.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;WALTERS, J.

Women make up 54% of enrollment at 832 schools that responded to an NCAA gender equity study in 2000; however, females at these institutions only account for 41% of the athletes. Before Title IX, 90% of women's college athletic programs were run by women, but by 1992 the number dropped to 42% since Title IX requires that there are equal opportunities for both genders.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"/&gt;  This violates Title IX's premise that the ratio of female athletes to male athletes should be roughly equivalent to the overall proportion of female and male students.&lt;ref name="garber1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garber |first=Greg |title=Landmark law faces new challenges even now |url=http://espn.go.com/gen/womenandsports/020619title9.html |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the issues today often revolve around the amount of money going into men's and women's sports. According to 2000–2001 figures, men's college programs still have many advantages over women's in the average number of scholarships (60.5%), operating expenses (64.5%), recruiting expenses (68.2%) and head coaching salaries (59.5%).&lt;ref name="garber1"/&gt; Other forms of inequality are in the coaching positions. Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women's teams; in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent.&lt;ref name="coakley255"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coakley |first=Jay |title=Sports in Society |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women's athletic programs, and in 2004 this fell to 19 percent. Also in 2004, 18 percent of all women's programs had no women administrators.&lt;ref name="coakley255"/&gt; In 2004, there were 3,356 administrative jobs in NCAA women's athletic programs and of those jobs, women held 35 percent of them.&lt;ref name="coakley255"/&gt;

The fight for equality extends to the wallet. On March 30, 2016, five players from the U.S. women's soccer team filed a federal complaint of wage discrimination against U.S. Soccer, the governing body that pays both the men’s and women’s team. The complaint argues that U.S. Soccer pays players on the women’s team as little as forty percent of what it pays players on the men’s team. This pay discrepancy exists despite the fact that the women’s team has been much more successful in international competitions; the women’s team has won four Olympic gold medals and three of the last five Women’s World Cups, while the men’s team has never won either of these competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html?_r=0 |title=Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination |publisher=The New York Times |author=Andrew Das |date=2016-03-31 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 2015-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly so for [[women in Arab societies]]. The traditions of [[Islamic modesty]] in dress and requirements for women's sport to take place in a [[Sex segregation|single-sex environment]] make sports participation more difficult for devout female adherents. The lack of availability of suitably modest sports clothing and sports facilities that allow women to play in private contributes to the lack of participation. Cultural norms of women's roles and responsibilities towards the family may also be a source of discouragement from time-consuming sports practice.&lt;ref name=Women1&gt;[http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/research-projects/middle-east/muslim-women-in-sport/#_ftn7 Muslim Women in Sport].

However, Islamic tenets and religious texts suggest that women's sports in general should be promoted and are not against the values of the religion. The Quranic statements that followers of Islam should be healthy, fit and make time for leisure are not sex-specific. The prophet [[Muhammad]] is said to have raced his wife [[Aisha]] on several occasions, with Aisha beating him the first couple of times. Correspondingly, some scholars have proposed that Muslim women's lack of engagement with sport is due to cultural or societal reasons, rather than strictly religious ones.&lt;ref name=Women1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Women2/&gt;

However, besides religious testaments, there are many barriers for Muslim women in relation to sports participation. A significant barrier to Muslim women's sports participation is bans on the Islamic headscarf, commonly known as the [[hijab]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ayub |first=Awista |date=2011-04-14 |title=A Closer Look at FIFA's Hijab Ban: What it Means for Muslim Players and Lessons Learned |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/425421 |journal=SAIS Review of International Affairs |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |doi=10.1353/sais.2011.0010 |issn=1945-4724}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA instituted such a ban in 2011, preventing the Iranian women's national football team from competing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have since repealed the ban, but other organizations, including FIBA, maintain such regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://muslimmatters.org/2016/07/19/muslim-basketball-players-urge-fiba-to-allow-hijab/ |title=» Muslim Basketball Players Urge FIBA To Allow Hijab |access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many Muslim female athletes have achieved significant success in athletic competitions.

Iranian women were banned from attending a volleyball game and an Iranian girl was arrested for attending a match. Iran was given the right to host the International Beach Volleyball tournament, and many Iranian women were looking forward to attending the event. However, when the women tried to attend the event, they were disallowed, and told it was forbidden to attend by the FIVB. The women took to social media to share their outrage; however the Federation of International Beach volleyball refuted the accusations, saying it was a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/08/17/iranian-women-should-not-face-arrest-and-threats-for-watching-volleyball/ |title=Iranian women should not face arrest and threats for watching volleyball |author= |date=August 17, 2016 |work=NYTimes.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the instances of unfair treatment of women, trying to participate in supporting their teams in Iran.

In 1994, the International Working Group on Women and Sport organized the first World Conference on Women and Sport in Brighton, United Kingdom, where the Brighton Declaration was published. The IWG hosted further world conferences every four years, with the result of the Windfoek Call for Action (1998), Montreal Tool Kit (2002) and Brighton Plus Helsinki 2014 Declaration (2014). The conferences pretend to "develop a sporting culture that enables and values the full involvement of women in every aspect of sport and physical activity", by "increas[ing] the involvement of women in sport at all levels and in all functions and roles".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisu.net/medias/fichiers/EN_Helsinki_calls_the_world_of_sport_to_LEAD_THE_CHANGE_BE_THE_CHANGE_2.pdf 6th IWG World Conference on Women and Sport 2014 – The Legacy Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage for women's sports is significantly less than the coverage for men's sports. In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories. After recording sports news and highlights, they wrote a quantitative description of what they saw and a qualitative description of the amount of time that story received.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A., and Cheryl Cooky (2010): [https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/80/docs/tvsports.pdf "Gender in Televised Sports"]. n. pag. Dornsife.usc.edu. Center for Feminist Research, University of Southern California, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that first year that the research was conducted in 1989, it was recorded that 5% of the sports segments were based on women's sports, compared to the 92% that were based on men's sports and the 3% that was a combination of both. In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.

When researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports." LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tracy.

In newspapers articles, coverage on men's sports once again had a greater number of articles than women's sports in a ratio of 23–1. In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage. The lengths of these articles were 25–27% shorter than the length of men's articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84.org/coverage-of-womens-sports-in-four-daily-newspapers/ |title=Coverage of Women’s Sports in Four Daily Newspapers – LA84 Foundation |author= |date= |work=LA84.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an international frenzy in 2012 when the first woman that represented Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympics competed in track. That was the most women's sports coverage that there had been in several years.Women played 90 minutes of football, 80 minutes of rugby, 18 holes of golf and ran the same distance in a marathon as men https://www.irishtimes.com.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Exactly 12 months later, the newspapers returned to featuring 4% of articles on women's sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/sport/olympics-women-equality-attar/index.html |title=Why has coverage of women's sport stopped post Olympics? - CNN.com |first=Amanda |last=Davies |date=August 7, 2013 |work=CNN.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same trend can be seen with regards to the FIFA World Cup. The 2015 Women’s World Cup Final had an average of 25.4 million American viewers throughout the duration of the match, and peaked at 30.9 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Deitsch, Richard. "USA-Japan's Women's World Cup Final Shatters American TV 
Record Ratings." Futbol Planet. Sports Illustrated, 6 July 2015. Web. 8 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most-viewed game of soccer ever in the United States–men’s or women’s–by a margin of almost 7 million viewers. Despite this jump in viewership of women’s soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women’s professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men’s league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women’s Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons.

Amy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. "Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females." She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. "The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements."&lt;ref&gt;"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting" ''Science Daily''. September 2013. Web. December 2014. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130918090756.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The media has the ability to create or prevent interest in women's sports. Excluding women's sports from the media makes it much less likely for young girls to have role models that are women athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Donna A. Lopiano, Ph.D., (2008). Media Coverage of Women's Sports is Important, (2), Sports Management Resources, http://www.sportsmanagementresources.com/library/media-coverage-womens-sports&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tucker Center for Research on Girls &amp; Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota 40% of all athletes in the United States are women but women's sports only receive about 4% of sports media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota (Producer) and PBS, (2014). Media Coverage &amp; Female Athletes, http://video.tpt.org/video/2365132906/&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of coverage has decreased in the last 20 years although there has been a major increase in women athletes.

Media coverage has slightly increased and this is mostly due to social networking.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Social media has further exposed women sports out to the public world, and often at a much greater rate than traditional news media. Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.&lt;ref name="Cooky, C. 2012"&gt;Cooky, C., &amp; Lavoi, N. (2012). Playing but losing women's sports after title ix. ''Contexts,'' ''11''(1), 42–46. {{jstor|41960748}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mainstream media still is far behind in its showcasing of female sports in comparison to that of men's. A study has shown that ESPN, which began airing women NCAA tournament in 2003, aired eleven women tournament segments in comparison to one-hundred men's tournament segments.&lt;ref name="Cooky, C. 2012"/&gt; ESPN and other sports outlets are airing more female-oriented sporting events; however the length of the segments are very small. This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture. However, when women athletes were told to pick a picture that would increase interest in their sport, 47% picked a picture that sexualized the women athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013). Exploring elite female athletes' interpretations of sport media images: A window into the construction of social identity and "selling sex" in women's sports. Communication &amp; Sport, 1(3), 269–298. doi: 10.1177/2167479512473585&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is more representative than the United States with the BBC giving women's sports about 20% of their sports coverage (BBC spokesperson). Many women athletes in the UK do not see this as adequate coverage for the 36% of women who participate in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Lewis, (2014).

[[Gender in youth sports|Girls' and boys' participation]] rates in sports vary by country and region.  In the United States, nearly all schools require student participation in sports, guaranteeing that all girls were exposed to athletics at an early age, which was generally not the case in Western Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Marshall |first=J. |last2=Hardman |first2=K. |date=2016-07-24 |title=The State and Status of Physical Education in Schools in International Context |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1356336X000063001 |journal=[[European Physical Education Review]] |language=en |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203–229 |doi=10.1177/1356336x000063001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[intramural sports]], the genders were often mixed, though for competitive sports the genders remained segregated.  [[Title IX]] legislation required colleges and universities to provide equal athletic opportunities for women. This large pool of female athletes enabled the U.S. to consistently rank among the top nations in women's Olympic sports, and female Olympians from skater [[Peggy Fleming]] (1968) to [[Mary Lou Retton]] (1986) became household names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Tennis was the most-popular professional female sport from the 1970s onward,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and it provided the occasion for a symbolic "battle of the sexes" between [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Bobby Riggs]], enhancing the profile of female athletics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The success of [[Women's Tennis Association|women's tennis]], however, did little to help the fortunes of women's professional team sports.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Women's professional sports|Women's professional team sports]] achieved popularity for the first time in the 1990s, particularly in [[basketball]] and [[football (soccer)]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This popularity has been asymmetric, being strongest in the U.S., certain European countries and former Communist states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Thus, [[Women's association football|women's soccer]] was originally dominated by the U.S., China, and Norway, who have historically fielded weak men's national teams. However, {{when|date=February 2011}} several nations with strong and even dominant men's national teams, such as Germany, Sweden, and Brazil, have established themselves as women's powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Despite this increase in popularity, women's professional sports leagues continue to struggle financially. The [[WNBA]] is operated at a loss by the [[NBA]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} perhaps in the hope of creating a market that will eventually be profitable. A similar approach is used to promote [[women's boxing]], as women fighters are often [[undercard]]s on prominent male boxing events, in the hopes of attracting an audience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[National Women's Hockey League]] is an American women's professional ice hockey league, and the [[United Women's Lacrosse League]] is an American professional [[women's lacrosse]] league; both were established in 2015.

Today, women compete professionally and as amateurs in virtually every major sport, though the level of participation typically decreases when it comes to the more violent contact sports;  few schools have women's programs in American football, boxing or wrestling.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}There are exceptions to this, such as the [[Utah Girls Football League]] and [[Professional Girl Wrestling Association]]. However, these typical non-participation habits may slowly be evolving as more women take real interest in the games, for example [[Katie Hnida]] became the first woman ever to score points in a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[NCAA]] [[American football]] game when she kicked two [[extra-point]]s for the [[University of New Mexico]] in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Modern sports have seen the development of a higher profile for female athletes in other historically male sports, such as [[golf]], [[marathon]]s or [[ice hockey]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}These significant participation rise, has allowed more women to participate in traditionally male dominated sports and increased the sports popularity globally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

As of 2013, the only sports that men, but not women play professionally in the United States are [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], and [[Ultimate Frisbee]]. Although basketball, soccer and hockey have female sports leagues, they are far behind in terms of exposure and funding compared to the men's teams.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Recently{{When|date=April 2017}} there has been much more crossover as to which sports males and females participate in, although there are still some differences. For example, at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], both genders were allowed to participate in the sport of [[figure skating]], previously a female-only sporting event. However, the programs for the event required men to perform three triple jumps, and women only one.
