'''AEDIPS''', the '''Association of Educational Development and Improvement Professionals in Scotland''' is an association that supports the development of [[education in Scotland]], with a particular focus on [[entitlement]] and quality.

Formerly known as the '''AEAS''' (the '''Association of Educational Advisers in Scotland'''), AEDIPS updated its [[constitution]] and its name in 2005 to reflect the changing roles of professionals working in the areas of quality improvement, [[curriculum]], and professional development in Scottish education today.

AEDIPS acts as a forum for the approximate five hundred educational professionals now supporting schools in all sectors of education in the areas of improvement, curriculum, and professional development in local authorities in Scotland.

Membership of AEDIPS is open to permanent staff, secondees, [[consultants]], and former improvement and  development professionals who may have moved on from local authority work but wish to keep up with educational developments in Scotland.

'''App Academy''' is a twelve-week intensive [[computer programming]] school founded by Ned Ruggeri and Kush Patel.

==Overview==
Introduced in 2012, App Academy’s "job-guaranteed"&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2013/03/free-learn-to-code-boot-camp/]&lt;/ref&gt; financing model demonstrates a tuition-free structure that promises individuals a career at the conclusion of the program. App Academy’s model "reverses the traditional incentive structure for higher education";&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; this has received media attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/this-could-be-big-abc-news/back-school-job-150849131.html?vp=1/ |title=Back to School And Into a Job &amp;#124; This Could Be Big - Yahoo News |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yglesias |first=Matthew |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/22/app_academy_s_innovative_financial_model_commission_based_education.html |title=App Academy's innovative financial model: Commission-based education |publisher=Slate.com |date=2013-03-22 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by Wired as "flipping the script on student loans".&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wohlsen |first=Marcus |url=https://www.wired.com/business/2013/03/free-learn-to-code-boot-camp/ |title=Tuition at Learn-to-Code Boot Camp Is Free — Until You Get a Job &amp;#124; Wired Business |publisher=Wired.com |date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 93% of App Academy’s first cohort found jobs, paying an average salary of $83,000.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; If a student does not find a career within the first year of graduation, the individual is not charged for tuition.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/this-could-be-big-abc-news/back-school-job-150849131.html?vp=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 98% of App Academy graduates find jobs, with an average salary of $105,000 in San Francisco and $89,000 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appacademy.io/]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the establishment of App Academy, over 700 graduates have been placed at tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Cisco, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/students |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203175958/http://www.appacademy.io/students |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Program==
[[File:Appacademy.jpg|thumb|Students at work]]
App Academy, as of 2014, reported an acceptance rate of about 5%.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/03/13/have-liberal-arts-degree-will-code/]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who applied for the program ranged from "top Ivy League graduates to someone who used to be a night janitor."&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/24/learn-to-code-boot-camps-open-doors-for-talented-graduates/]&lt;/ref&gt; During the admissions process, students are required to complete introductory level coding work to show programmer potential, however, applicants do not need to have prior coding experience to apply.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; Once accepted, students can expect to allocate 90–100 hours per week for coding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/22/app_academy_s_innovative_financial_model_commission_based_education.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum covers the full stack of web development, but primarily focuses on [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Javascript]] while spending substantial time on [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], Flux, [[JQuery]] and [[SQL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appacademy.io/#p-curriculum]&lt;/ref&gt; App Academy also provides job assistance for life, allowing students to learn new languages although they have graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/course/finding-a-job#3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130012324/http://www.appacademy.io/course/finding-a-job |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

App Academy’s 12-week program is broken into 3 sections with over 500 hours of instructional time for every student who attends the course;

Weeks 1-5: Begins with introductory level programming concepts, and results in a deeper understanding of [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[SQL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/1-5#1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129222424/http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/1-5 |archivedate=2016-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks 6-9: Introduces [[Javascript]], [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], and Flux, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/6-9#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129185604/http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/6-9 |archivedate=2016-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks 10-12: Focuses on advanced algorithms and the job search. The job search curriculum focuses on resume help, [[whiteboarding]], technical interview training, salary negotiation and culminates in a hiring day for graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/10-12#3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130005408/http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/10-12 |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout a day at App Academy, students are given a lecture at the beginning of every session, with the majority of the time being allocated to projects and [[pair programming]].&lt;ref name="appacademy.io"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/course/day-in-the-life#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130055335/http://www.appacademy.io/course/day-in-the-life |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 9:00am–12:00pm, students start off the day with introductory lectures for the concepts to be learned that day. From 12:00pm–1:00pm, students are given a break to relax and connect with their colleagues. Afterwards, students begin pair-programming and work on collaborative projects together until the end of the working day, allowing individuals to talk through problems together to find collective solutions.&lt;ref name="appacademy.io"/&gt;

Additionally, App Academy offers tutoring for potential applicants who seek assistance during the admissions process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.appacademy.io/students/tutoring]&lt;/ref&gt; Tutors are instructors from the App Academy Staff and tutoring can range from teaching coding fundamentals to advanced concepts within the full-time program.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Some of App Academy’s graduates have reportedly found a job within 3 weeks of interviewing.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/&gt; After finding a job as a software engineer, App Academy collects a fee of 18% of the graduate’s first year’s salary.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/&gt;

==Location==
In 2015, App Academy was located in the [[South of Market]] district of [[San Francisco]] and near [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] in [[Manhattan]], New York.

As of January 2016, App Academy's San Francisco Location has moved to 160 Spear Street inside the [[Financial District]].

Prior to App Academy, Ruggeri worked for [[Google]] on the [[search engine indexing]] team and Patel worked at a [[hedge fund]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/#p-staff|title=Apps Academy - Staff|publisher=Appacademy.io|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they started App Academy in an effort to allow programming education "while making it affordable and accessible to everyone." In an interview with Patel, he explains the initial structure of App Academy, stating the need to teach "as much language and framework agnostic software development as we can."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coursereport.com/schools/app-academy#/news/interview-with-kush-patel-founder-of-app-academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2012, App Academy has been featured in sources such as [[Slate magazine]] and [[VentureBeat]], reflecting Ruggeri and Patel’s mission of "finding the most cost-effective way possible of providing credible training."&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2014/01/30/california-bootcamp-will-work-with-regulator-whatever-the-cost-its-worth-it-to-satisfy-the-state-interview/]&lt;/ref&gt; Kush reported to Yahoo News stating the need to "give [students] real-world skills they can use and actually get them a job."&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt; "If they can’t find a job, we’ve screwed up somehow." says Patel.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;

Through an interview with ''[[Financial Times]]'', Joshua Penman, a graduate of App Academy, explained that the boot camp model "is attractive because it is so short and provides people with real skills."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ac5afa80-3ce6-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152.html#axzz3yfAAcdMF]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, many individuals who enrolled in the first class at App Academy did not have enough capital to "invest in themselves."&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; However, since then, applicants are seen to come from diverse backgrounds, whether it be individuals who have followed traditional college endeavors or individuals wanting a mid-career change.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;

'''Audio induction loop''' systems, also called '''audio-frequency induction loops''' ('''AFILs''') or '''hearing loops''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get in the Hearing Loop|url=http://www.audiology.org/resources/consumer/Pages/Get_in_theHearingLoop.aspx|work=American Academy of Audiology|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an assistive listening technology for individuals with reduced ranges of hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Get in the Hearing Loop" Campaign Promotes Doubling Functionality of Hearing Aids|url=http://www.hearingloss.org/content/get-hearing-loop|work=Hearing Loss Association of America|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hearing loop consists of a physical loop of cable or an array of loops of cable which are placed around a designated area, usually a room or a building. The cable generates a magnetic field throughout the looped space which can be picked up by a [[Telecoil|hearing aid]], [[cochlear implant|cochlear implant (CI) processors]], and specialized hand-held hearing loop receivers for individuals without telecoil compatible hearing aids.

The loops carry [[baseband]] audio-frequency currents; no carrier signal is used. The benefit is that it allows the sound source of interest—whether a musical performance or a ticket taker's side of the conversation—to be transmitted to the hearing-impaired listener clearly and free of other distracting noise in the environment.&lt;ref name="ny times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|title=A Hearing Aid That Cuts Out All the Clatter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/science/24loops.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hearing%20loop&amp;st=cse|accessdate=25 October 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical installation sites include concert halls, ticket kiosks, high-traffic public buildings (for [[Public address|PA]] announcements), auditoriums, places of worship, courtrooms, meeting rooms, and homes.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helping Those With Hearing Loss Get In The Loop|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128268480|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, as an aid for disability, their provision, where reasonably possible, is required by the [[Equality Act 2010]] and previously by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]],&lt;ref&gt;Action on Hearing (formerly RNID/Deafness Research UK)&lt;/ref&gt; and they are available in "the back seats of all London taxis, which have a little microphone embedded in the dashboard in front of the driver; at 18,000 post offices in the U.K.; at most churches and cathedrals", according to Prof. David G. Myers.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

In the United States, an alternative technology using FM transmission to "neck loop" receivers was more widely adopted due to economic advantages. In comparison, hearing loop systems require a greater initial investment by the facility operator, but offer greater convenience and avoid the social stigma and hygienic concerns entailed by the FM system's paraphernalia for those who have hearing aids.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

Another alternative system, used primarily in theatres, uses invisible infrared radiation; compatible headsets can pick up the modulated infrared energy to reproduce sound.

==History==
The pickup coil in a hearing aid is known as a '''telecoil''' (or T-coil) because its early form was to pick up a magnetic field from coils within a [[telephone]].  These were included as a part of the method of enabling a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires.  The telecoil enabled hearing aid user hears the phone conversation clearly without also picking up background noise.

From this, the natural development was to generate audio magnetic fields which the telecoil could receive.

==Induction loop theory==
The simple form of AFIL is a single wire around a room, driven from a power amplifier as a [[loudspeaker]] would be driven.  The coupling of magnetic fields is described mathematically by [[Faraday's law of induction]].  A summary of the theory necessary for AFILs is included in British Standard '''BS&amp;nbsp;7594''', which is a guide to the design and installation of induction loops.

==Practical induction loops==

The simple form of AFIL using a general purpose amplifier suffers from some disadvantages.  The loop driver amplifier requires some additional circuits to overcome these.  Using anything other than a correctly designed loop driver amplifier is not only unsatisfactory, but may result in a loop installation that can generate [[harmonics]] when driven into distortion, and these will cause [[radio interference]].  This must be prevented, both for sound quality and for legal reasons as it is illegal to cause such [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] in these circumstances.  In Europe, the [[EMC Directive]] applies, and it is also illegal to supply or install unsuitable electronic and electrical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;The EMC Directive of the European Union, and regulations under "enabling legislation".&lt;/ref&gt;

A second factor is that many forms of [[hearing impairment]] mean that [[DB SPL|sound levels]] must be kept fairly constant.  An effective loop driver will have an [[automatic gain control|automatic level control]] providing a constant loop signal for a wide range of source levels.  Meeting this requirement is likely to meet the interference requirement at the same time.  To do this, the loop driver should give constant output for at least 30[[Decibel|dB]] input range.

A third problem is the inductance of the loop cable, and its effect upon the higher frequencies of sound.  To overcome this, many loop drivers operate as current mode amplifiers instead of voltage mode.  By setting the amplifier characteristic between voltage and current mode, the overall performance is optimised for good bandwidth with minimum distortion.  There are other options for reducing the effect of cable inductance, including reducing inductance with a multi-core cable where the conductors are connected in parallel.

Structural steel, and other metalwork in buildings can cause a problem by reducing the field strength unevenly across the loop area and causing frequency distortions. In most cases, a solution can be found using combinations of loops with phase shift between them, combined with frequency correction and increased signal strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampetronic.co/design_metal.asp |title=Induction loop systems in metal structures |publisher=Ampetronic.co |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different ways to configure conductive loops to give different patterns of magnetic fields and solve different technical problems such as the presence of metal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampetronic.co/layouts_overview.asp |title=Audio induction loop system layouts |publisher=Ampetronic.co |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other equipment within the magnetic field===

Audio induction loops create fairly high magnetic field levels.  Other equipment must be designed and installed to work properly within this field.

The most common cause of problems is [[Ground loop (electricity)|earth loops]], where different pieces of equipment are connected together by signal wires, but powered from different power sockets in different parts of the room or building.  The combination of the mains earth and signal earth creates a receiving loop that produces an interference signal proportional to the area within the earth loop.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance notes in BS7594&lt;/ref&gt; Various steps are used to prevent interference on audio and video equipment. Powering signal sources and output devices from the same mains circuit to prevent formation of an earth loop; shielded cables or signal isolators may be used.

==Technical standards==
An objective of the field strength requirements of standards for AFILs is to make the perceived loudness of sound from the loop the same as from the microphone in the hearing aid.  This is the basis of the average field strength of 100mA/m used to generate today's performance standards around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Introductory notes in various specifications&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEC&amp;nbsp;60118-4''' (formerly Britain's BS&amp;nbsp;6083 part 4, also known as EN&amp;nbsp;60118-4) is now the main specification for international use.&lt;ref&gt;Standard available from the International Electrotecnical Commission or IEC www.iec.ch&lt;/ref&gt;  This is based on the principle that the long term average of the field strength at a typical listening location must be 100mA/m, +- 3&amp;nbsp;dB. To determine this long term average requires a measurement over 60 seconds or more. The standard therefore sets a more pragmatic requirement for determining the short term peaks of the signal. Short term peaks need to be 12&amp;nbsp;dB (x4) higher than the long term average, based on the fact that peaks of speech are approximately 12&amp;nbsp;dB higher than the long term average level of speech. Therefore, an induction loop system or AFILS must be capable of delivering field strength peaks of 400mA/m +- 3&amp;nbsp;dB (280 to 560mA/m). Peaks must be measured using fast RMS measurement (125ms averaging time).

In addition the IEC&amp;nbsp;60118-4 standard sets limits on acceptable background noise, and requires that the system delivers frequency response of +- 3&amp;nbsp;dB from 100&amp;nbsp;Hz to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz relative to the field strength at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. All measurements must be made with a coil that picks up only the vertical component of the magnetic field, the component that is picked up by the telecoil of a hearing aid.

'''BS&amp;nbsp;7594''' (published by the [[British Standards Institution|BSI]] and widely used in Britain) is a non-mandatory guideline for the design and installation of induction loops.  It has a comprehensive guide to theory, as well as guidance for those considering the installation of AFILs in buildings for which they may be responsible.  It also contains some valuable guidance relating to other equipment within the loop area.  The calibration of field strength measuring devices is also included.

== Plot ==
Still mystified by his son's death, the father ([[Jo Sung-ha]]) of high school student Ki-tae ([[Lee Je-hoon]]) tries to track down his two best friends, classmates Hee-joon ([[Park Jung-min (actor)|Park Jung-min]]) and Dong-yoon ([[Seo Jun-young]]), to try to find an explanation. Through Ki-tae's classmate Jae-ho, the father meets Hee-joon, who says he cannot help as he moved schools "weeks before what happened to Ki-tae." Afterwards, Hee-joon berates Jae-ho for giving his phone number to Ki-tae's father but Jae-ho tells him that Ki-tae "went crazy" after he moved away. Hee-joon manages to trace Dong-yoon and urges him to contact Ki-tae's father and provide some answers. In parallel, flashbacks to the time gradually reveal what really happened, starting with Ki-tae's needling and bullying of Hee-joon and the latter's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Bleak Night|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/bleak-night|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cho|first=Jae-eun|title=No easy answers in complex portrait of teen angst|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2933888|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=25 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127072359/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2933888|archivedate=27 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Neil|title=Bleak Night: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bleak-night-film-review-99747|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">'''CSCOPE''' is a [[K-12]] [[Curriculum|educational curriculum]] support system that has been widely adopted in [[Texas]]. It was created by the Texas Education Service Center Curriculum Collaborative (TESCCC).

==Use==

Nineteen out of twenty education regions in Texas have districts that use CSCOPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gulick |first=Joe |url=http://lubbockonline.com/education/2010-08-15/new-curriculum-system-cscope-bring-big-changes-schools-lubbock-across-state |title=New curriculum system CSCOPE to bring big changes to schools in Lubbock, across state &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of January 2, 2011 there were 747 [[school district]]s (out of 1,051 total) using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/01/02/2739194/school-districts-adopting-cscope.html |title=School districts adopting CSCOPE online curriculum &amp;#124; Mom2MomDFW.com |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

While popular with district administrators, CSCOPE has elicited mixed reactions from teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.proteacher.net/discussions/showthread.php?t=84597 |title=Texas Teachers ~ Do you use C-Scope? - ProTeacher Community |publisher=Proteacher.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom feel excessively constrained by a set [[School timetable|timetable]] for lessons.  Other teachers, however, feel that CSCOPE is appreciated by the students and has improved classroom performance and attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Roger |url=http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927 |title=News &amp; Photos - The Llano News - Llano, Texas |publisher=The Llano News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312034723/http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927# |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that CSCOPE will better help prepare districts for the next generation of [[standardized test]]s in Texas, such as the [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=7874 |title=Texas Education Agency - STAAR debuts |publisher=Tea.state.tx.us |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is a product of an increased emphasis on [[accountability]] in [[State school|public education]] over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Work |first=Ann |url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2010/mar/26/local-schools-planning-for-new-cscope-curriculum/ |title=Local schools planning for new CSCOPE curriculum |publisher=Times Record News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upcoming changes==
In 2013, after complaints about parents' inability to access the curriculum as well as about lesson plans, Texas announced significant changes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/cypresscreek/news/sen-patrick-cscope-announce-sweeping-changes/article_dfb36eaa-7216-11e2-9245-0019bb2963f4.html |title=
Sen. Patrick, CSCOPE announce sweeping changes  |publisher=Cyprus Creek Mirror |date=Feb 8, 2013 |accessdate=Feb 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be made to the system. These changes include:

* Making all meetings of the governing board public, and meeting all the respective [[notice]] requirements.
* A joint review process of all CSCOPE lessons, beginning with [[Social studies|Social Studies]].
* Removing civil or criminal penalties associated with the release of CSCOPE content.
* Allowing teachers to post any and all CSCOPE lessons that they deem necessary.
* Creating a standing curriculum review panel composed of parents, teachers, and school administrators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3002">The '''Central Register and Clearing House (CRCH)''' was an administrative organisation in teacher education in England and Wales which existed for almost sixty years.  It pre-dated by some thirty years a similar organisation for university courses ([[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]]).

By the late 1920s great confusion had developed in admissions to teacher training courses.  There were some fifty colleges. Potential students applied direct to each one and could receive an unlimited number of offers of places.  Colleges had no idea how many students would arrive, and applicants had no central source of vacancy information.  Problems were eased by ad hoc co-operation between the colleges and their joint Committee of Principals, but it became clear that an administrative solution was needed.  The Training Colleges Clearing House was the result and was founded in 1933.  Under the new system a candidate was considered in turn by only one college at a time, from a list chosen by each applicant, with forwarding of the application ceasing when a place was offered.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE), Handbook of Colleges and Departments of Education.  Published every two years from 1954 then annually from 1967 to 1992.  The edition cited is 1973, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1943 the Committee of Principals became the [[Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE)]].  By 1944 there were some 55 colleges and about 5000 applicants.  There was a large post-war expansion in numbers being trained as teachers.  From 1960 the Clearing House worked in close co-existence with the new [[Graduate Teacher Training Registry]].  In 1962 the newly renamed Central Register and Clearing House was set up as a limited company but was still supervised by the ATCDE and was based at their offices in Crawford Place, London W1.  By 1972 the scheme had 160 member colleges and 56000 applicants.

The CRCH was involved in discussions with both UCCA and the polytechnics as early as 1972 about the future shape of higher education admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Ronald, "UCCA: Its Origins and Development 1950-85, UCCA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  

CRCH handled applications to non-teaching degree courses as these began to be introduced at its member colleges. The CRCH ceased to function after the cycle leading to admissions in 1992 and its responsibilities passed on to [[UCAS]].  Its records are lodged in the Library at the University of Warwick.  Some had already been published in an earlier document.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerbutts, Beryl, Record of the Clearing House 1960-1984, published privately, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15129">'''Climate Change Education''' (CCE) is learning geared toward helping people address and develop effective responses to [[climate change]]. It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change, prepares them to live with the impacts of climate change and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=6, 8, 10, 32, 40, 44, 46, 48, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCE helps policy-makers understand the urgency and importance of putting mechanisms into place to combat climate change on a national and global scale. Communities learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own [[climate footprint]]. In particular, CCE helps increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CCE is rooted in [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme ==
Established in 2010, the [[UNESCO]] Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme (CCESD) aims to help people understand climate change by expanding CCE activities in [[Nonformal learning|nonformal education]] through the media, networking and partnerships. It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase ‘climate literacy’, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national [[Curriculum|curricula]] and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD ==

=== Australia ===
Australia has been at the forefront of [[Education for sustainable development|education for sustainability]], adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and [[Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability]]. These provided a strong foundation for Australia’s strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the [[Education for sustainable development#United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development .28DESD.29|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]]. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and [[lifelong learning]]. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government’s National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|VET sector]]. [[Council of Australian Governments|COAG]] endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== China ===
China introduced [[environmental education]] in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country’s sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, [[curriculum development]], capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Denmark ===
Denmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, [[waste management]] and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on ‘green transition’ does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the ‘greening’ of TVET as part of the government’s sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO-led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dominican Republic ===
The Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD’s strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salomé Ureña Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Higher Education Plan (PDES) includes environmental issues in the curricula and establishes a research programme to promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dominican Republic has been involved in a number of ESD and CCE initiatives that have helped build local capacity, including:
* formal, non-formal and informal projects on ESD led by governmental agencies, civil society organizations, young leaders and local communities;
* UN: CC Learn Project, which supports the design and implementation of results-oriented and sustainable learning to address climate change (see the detailed case study in this Report);
* National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resource Capacities to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (ENDVBERC);
* teacher training supported by the UN: CC Learn-UNITAR, and the UNESCO-CCESD pilot programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== England ===
Environmental and development education have been present in England since the 1970s, when civil society organizations took the lead. From the late 1990s, the UK government promoted sustainable development and ESD at the local, regional and national levels. However, while a number of strategic government reports addressed CCE, government policy has focused less on ESD since 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2008 report Brighter Futures – Greener Lives: Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2010 outlined a number of specific initiatives related to Climate Change Education using an ESD approach. This included empowering youth with the skills, knowledge and freedom to voice their opinions and make a difference. The same year, CCE was introduced into the Key Stage Three (11 to 14 year-olds) geography curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The report Education for Sustainable Development in the UK 2010 noted that there were signs of substantial progress in embedding ESD-related policies and developing practices in the UK across a wide range of sectors in 2008 and 2009. For example, documents in 2009 highlighted the ‘Sustainable Schools’ project that aims to empower youth to cope with the future challenges facing the planet. The aim is for all schools to be ‘Sustainable Schools’ by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
The Republic of Korea has a number of policies and initiatives supporting environmental education. In 2008, the Environmental Education Promotion Act encouraged the development of environmental education. It aimed to raise national environmental awareness, to encourage people to develop research and inquiry skills, and to put what they learn into action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ministry of Environment, in its 2011-2015 Environmental Education Master Plan, proposed a policy agenda for environmental education to be implemented through formal education, social environmental education and educational infrastructure approaches. The various approaches in the formal education area include:
* ‘Environment and Green Growth’ as an elective subject in middle and high school curricula, and classes in elementary school designed to integrate environmental education; 
* the establishment of the Natural Environmental Studies Institute that o ers interactive youth programmes for environmental studies;
* Environment Model Schools, designed to demonstrate best-practice;
* ‘Low Carbon Challenge’ involving ten universities;
* in-service training for teachers to upskill, specializing in environmental education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

; Recruiting staff: [[Paul Drennan Cravath]] preferred to hire the "best of the best" and looked to the better law schools for candidates. Graduates were expected to be members of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]/[[Beta Gamma Sigma]] and have served as editors for the school [[law review]]s. A graduate from a university outside the top 5 was expected to be at minimum the equivalent of a "B" student at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]]. Only new graduates were to be hired, except in extenuating circumstances. The belief was that someone who had worked anywhere else had learned bad habits already.
; Training staff: Associates would be assigned to a partner for a period of time (usually 18 months or less) where they would learn to break down large tasks into manageable pieces.
; Compensation: Early law firm hiring practices paid the associates nothing, except what they could bring in for themselves. By 1910, the Cravath firm was one of the first to hire incoming lawyers on a salary. Since they preferred to hire the best, this led to wide disparities in starting salaries. [[Collusion]] among law firms and law schools led to uniform starting salaries across law firms from the end of World War I to World War II.&lt;ref&gt;page 6 of Swaine&lt;/ref&gt;
; Tenure: Generally, only partners may have permanent employment at the firm, and as long as an associate is promotable, they may stay. Those who were not suitable for promotion were dismissed in the "[[up or out]]" policy.
; Choosing partners: Unless there is some need for expertise unavailable within the firm, partners should be chosen only from within the office.
; Interests outside the firm: Partners and associates may not have business interests outside the firm. Charitable, educational and artistic interests are permitted. There are no [[part time]] associates and partners, and all business in the office is company business.
; Relationships of the partners: Partners are expected to work with each other. Silos and [[clique]]s are to be avoided.
; Scope of the practice: Cravath handled predominantly [[Civil law (common law)|civil matters]] in the early years, and the majority of firms adopting this system are likewise civil law firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Greenfield | first = Scott | title = There's No Cravath System For Criminal Defense | url = http://blog.simplejustice.us/2009/06/13/theres-no-cravath-system-for-criminal-defense.aspx | accessdate = 2009-06-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090617183927/http://blog.simplejustice.us/2009/06/13/theres-no-cravath-system-for-criminal-defense.aspx | archivedate = 2009-06-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Influence: The firm would avoid [[lobbying]] or currying favors with politicians. The firm would stick with skill and diligence in applying the law.
; As to the firm's management: Cravath believed that a firm must have strong executive direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11615">'''Donald Snygg''' (September 24, 1904 – February 1, 1967) was a teacher, a scholar, and a successful basketball and football coach. He is best known for and identified with the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenological Psychology]].

== Early years ==

Donald Snygg (born Oram Donald Snygg) was the second child and first son of Edward Emil Snygg and Florence Woolston Snygg, merchants in [[Magnet, Nebraska]]. His older sister, Rachael, was a teacher and homemaker. His younger brother, Edward (Ned), manufactured and fitted artificial limbs.

Snygg received his primary and secondary education in a one-room schoolhouse and in 1924 obtained his B.A. from the Nebraska State Teachers' College (now [[Wayne State College]]) in [[Wayne, Nebraska]]. He attended summer school at [[Columbia University]] in 1926 and spent additional summers between 1929 and 1932 at the [[University of Iowa]] where he earned his M.A.

Between 1924 and 1930, he was a science instructor at Randolph High School in [[Randolph, Nebraska]]. He was also the school's principal from 1925–30, and as basketball and football coach, he led Randolph's teams to a series of winning seasons remembered by some as the Snygg Era.&lt;ref&gt;no author. (1927, May 2). [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/60988961/ Lincoln, Nebraska: ''The Lincoln Star''. p. 4. Retrieved from ''https://www.newspapers.com''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;n.a. (1927, November 15). [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/58094517/ Lincoln, Nebraska: ''The Lincoln Star.'' p. 14. Retrieved from ''https://www.newspapers.com''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Snygg was hired as Superintendent of Public Schools in [[Verdigre, Nebraska]], but in 1933, as the Depression deepened, the School Board, in good conscience, could no longer employ both Snygg and his wife. The Snyggs resigned and moved to Canada where he began his doctoral studies.

== Graduate school ==

At the [[University of Toronto]], Snygg studied psychology under K. S. Bernhardt, E. A. Bott, and W. Line. He conducted experiments in learning with humans and rats.&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, Donald, ''Part 1. Human Learning'' (from Snygg's thesis), The Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, vol 47, issue 2, 1935, pp 299-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, Donald, Mazes in Which Rats Take the Longer Path to Food, The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, vol 1, issue 1, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;
Rats, he found, preferred a simple path to their goal over a shorter but more complicated path. Snygg completed his Ph.D. at Toronto in 1935 and stayed on to lecture and do research there for the next two years while also serving as Psychologist to the Toronto Juvenile Court.&lt;ref name=obitOswego&gt;n.a. (1967, February 1) [http://www.fultonhistory.com/Process%20small/Newspapers/Oswego%20Palladium/Oswego%20Palladium%20Jan-March%201967%20pdf/Newspaper%20%20Oswego%20Palladium%20Jan-March%201967%20-%200397.pdf Professor Donald Snygg, Noted Psychologist, Fatally Stricken].

== Oswego years ==

== Phenomenological psychology ==

In a seminal article, published in Psychological Review in 1941, Snygg asserted that past theories of personality had failed and that a new approach was needed.
He argued that, to understand why people behave as they do, it is essential to understand [[phenomenal field theory|how they see the world]]. To predict and influence how they might behave in the future, one needs to understand the mechanisms by which this world view changes.
Other publications followed, most notably the book ''Individual Behavior'', co-authored with Arthur Combs and published in 1949.
Snygg's work on personality is often connected with that of other pioneers in the field, including [[Gordon Allport]] and [[Carl Rogers]]. About Snygg's phenomenological psychology, [[C. George Boeree]] wrote: "(''it'') fails to gain the attention it deserves because it is too simple, too clear, too practical."&lt;ref&gt;Boeree, C. G. (n.d.)

Shippensberg, Pennsylvania: Shippensberg University&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
While Snygg was principal of Randolph High School, he hired Elaine Morrow, of Iowa, as the school's home economics teacher. In 1927, they married.

Don and Elaine had three children, all of whom followed academic careers. John Morrow Snygg taught mathematics and physics, first at Hunter College in New York City, and then at Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey, and authored books on [[Clifford algebra|Clifford Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, J.

In late 1966, months before his death, Snygg was designated ''University Professor'', a position shared by only a select few in the SUNY system.&lt;ref name=obitOswego /&gt;

Two scholarships, ''The Donald Snygg Scholar-Athlete Award'', in recognition of his support of intercollegiate athletics at Oswego, and ''The Donald Snygg Graduate Scholarship'', for post-graduate students of psychology, were established in his name.&lt;ref&gt;n.a.

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Paul]] Writing His Epistles'', by [[Valentin de Boulogne]] or [[Nicolas Tournier]] (c. 16th century, Blaffer Foundation Collection, Houston, TX).]]

An '''epistle''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|əl}}; {{lang-el|ἐπιστολή}}, ''epistolē,'' "letter") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal [[Didacticism|didactic]] letter.  The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[Scribe|scribal-school]] writing curriculum. The letters in the [[New Testament]] from [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] to [[Early Christianity|Christians]] are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are known as [[Pauline epistles]] and the others as [[General epistles|catholic (i.e., "general") epistles]].

==Ancient Argon epistles==
The [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptians]] wrote epistles, most often for [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] reasons. [[Egyptologist]] Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth-dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Djedkare Isesi]]—in his many letters sent to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]]—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre.&lt;ref name=wente&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters from Ancient Egypt: Society of Biblical Literature Writing from the Ancient World Series Volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn=978-1555404734|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.02262.0001.001|author=Edward F. Wente|translator = Edmund S. Meltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its existence is firmly attested during the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]], and is prominently featured in the educational guide ''The Book of Kemit'' written during the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=wente/&gt; A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. The epistolary formulae used in the [[Ramesside Period]] found its roots in the letters composed during the [[Amarna Period]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]. Wente describes the "Satirical Letter" found on the [[Papyrus Anastasi&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic [[ostraca]] (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]]; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Greek]] domination.&lt;ref name=wente/&gt;

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and particularly the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The letters of [[Cicero]] are one of the most important sources on the history of the late [[Roman Republic]] and preserve features of colloquial [[Latin]] not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. [[Ovid]] produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in [[elegiac couplet]]s: the ''[[Heroides]]'', letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Ex Ponto]]'', written in first person during the poet's [[Ovid#Exile to Tomis|exile]]. The epistles of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later [[Church Fathers|patristic]] writers.

==Form of Christian epistles==
Epistles are written in strict accordance to formalized, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] tradition, especially the [[Pauline epistles]]. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers. Any deviancy is not the result of accident but indicates an unusual motive of the writer.

===Opening===
In contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see [[Philippians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%201:1;&amp;version=31; 1:1]). The scribe (or more correctly, the [[amanuensis]]) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the ''episte'' (e.g., [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2016:22;&amp;version=31; 16:22]). In the absence of a [[postal system]], the [[courier]] may also be named (e.g. [[Ephesians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%206:21-22;&amp;version=31; 6:21–22]).

After the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, "Grace and peace to you." "Grace" was a common Hellenistic greeting, while "peace" ([[shalom]]) was the common [[Judaism|Jewish]] greeting; this reflected Paul's dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.

===Body===
The body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.

==New Testament epistles==
The epistles of the [[New Testament]] canon are usually divided as follows:

== Epistles of Apostolic Fathers ==
These are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the [[New Testament]]. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word "epistle" is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus "epistle" lends additional weight of authority.

==Liturgical use==&lt;!-- Epistle (liturgy) redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Epistle to Galatians Illuminatad.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Epistle to the Galatians, [[illuminated manuscript]] for reading during [[Christian liturgy]].]]
In the context of a [[liturgy]], epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the [[General epistles]])—sometimes also from the [[Book of Acts]] or the [[Revelation of John]], but not the [[Four Gospels]]—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.

===Western churches===
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[Eucharist]], epistles are read between the [[Collect]] and the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]] reading. The corresponding [[Gregorian chant]]s have a special tone (''tonus epistolae''). When the epistle is sung or chanted at [[Solemn Mass]] it is done so by the [[subdeacon]]. Epistles are also read by an [[Elder (Christianity)#Lutheranism|Elder]] or [[Bishop#Lutheranism|Bishop]] in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], between the [[gradual]] and the Gospel.

===Eastern churches===
[[File:Kniga Apostol 1632 Drukarnya S Sobal.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Kniga Apostol'' (1632), [[lectionary]] in [[Church Slavonic]] for use in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].]]
In the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Byzantine Rite Catholic]]s the Epistle reading is called the ''Apostol'' (the same name is given to the [[lectionary]] from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the [[Apocalypse]] (Revelation of John).  Unlike the [[Latin Rite]] there are never readings from the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Apostle (in Liturgy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Epistle [[lection|lessons]] for every day of the year, except for weekdays during [[Great Lent]], when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the [[Paschal cycle]], being ultimately dependent upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the [[feast day]]s of numerous [[saint]]s and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the [[Prokeimenon]] and the [[Alleluia]]. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the [[Gospel]], though some services, such as [[Matins]], will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle. A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]], though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a [[bishop]]), it is read by a [[deacon]]. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the [[Prokeimenon]].'''

==Medieval Epistles==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the [[ars dictaminis]] became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] system in the early [[Middle Ages]], factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Malcolm |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 52–66 |chapter= The ''Art dictaminis'', the Formulary, and Medieval Epistolary Practice |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period's ''lingua franca'', [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poster |first1=Carol |last2=Utz |first2=Richard |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 285–300 |chapter= Appendix&amp;nbsp;B: A Bibliography of Medieval Latin ''Dictamen'' |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]]'s '''Erasmus Mundus''' programme aims to enhance quality in higher education through [[scholarship]]s and academic co-operation between the EU and the rest of the world.

Erasmus Mundus comprises three actions:
* Joint programmes
* Partnerships
* Attractiveness projects

==Erasmus Mundus Joint Programmes==
Under Action 1, Erasmus Mundus supports Joint Programmes ([[Master's degree|Masters Courses]] and Joint Doctorates) that are operated by consortia of higher education institutions from the EU and (since 2009) elsewhere in the world. They provide an integrated course and joint or multiple diplomas following study or research at two or more higher education institutions.
 
Erasmus Mundus funds a number of scholarships for students and academics studying or teaching on Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. Since 2010, fellowships have also been available for doctoral candidates following one of the Joint doctorates.

Scholarships cover participation costs, subsistence costs, and insurance for the duration of the study period. Many students also have the right to a contribution to travel costs.

==Erasmus Mundus partnerships==
Under Action 2, Erasmus Mundus Partnerships bring together higher education institutions from Europe and from a particular region in the world. Together, the partnerships manage mobility flows between the two regions for a range of academic levels—undergraduate, masters, doctorate, [[post-doctorate]]—and for academic staff.

Scholarships cover participation costs, subsistence costs, insurance for the duration of the study period, plus a contribution to travel costs.

==Erasmus Mundus Attractiveness Projects==
Under Action 3, Erasmus Mundus funds projects to enhance the attractiveness and visibility of European higher education worldwide. Activities focus on the international dimension of higher education, often targeting a particular region or academic discipline.

== Funding ==
Funding is available for:
* European joint masters and doctorates
* Partnerships with non-European higher education institutions and scholarships for students and academics
* Projects to promote European higher education worldwide

==In popular culture==
Pakistani novelist [[Nimra Ahmed]]'s novel "Jannat K Patte" (Leaves of Heaven) is based on [[Erasmus Programme]], where the protagonist Haya went to [[Sabancı University]] through Erasmus Mundus, which marked the turning point in her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urdunovelsonline.com/category/nimra-ahmed/ Online novels by Nimra Ahmed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Service Institute''' ('''FSI''') is the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]'s primary training institution for employees of the U.S. foreign affairs community, preparing American diplomats as well as other professionals to advance U.S. foreign affairs interests overseas and in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|title=Hiring Window Is Open at the Foreign Service|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/jobs/21officers.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 20, 2008|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSI provides more than 800 courses—including over 70 foreign languages—to more than 170,000 enrollees a year from the [[Department of State]] and more than 50 other government agencies and the military service branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiser|first=Mindy|title=Foreign Service Institute Prepares Government Workers for Global Careers|url=https://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15351:foreign-service-institute-prepares-government-workers-for-global-careers&amp;catid=1557&amp;Itemid=428|work=[[Washington Diplomat]]|date=May 5, 2017|access-date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSI is based at the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

The Institute's programs include training for the development of [[United States Foreign Service]] and Civil Service professionals, and for Foreign Service Nationals who work at U.S. posts around the world. Ranging in length from one day to two years, courses are designed to promote successful performance in each professional assignment, to ease the adjustment to other countries and cultures, and to enhance the leadership and management capabilities of the U.S. foreign affairs community. Other courses and services help family members prepare for the demands of a mobile lifestyle and living abroad, and provide employees and their families with important information about such critical and timely topics as emergency preparedness and cyber-security awareness, among others.

According to the Foreign Service Institute’s website, the Foreign Service Institute is the U.S. government’s “premier foreign affairs training  provider...dedicated to ensuring the career-long learning opportunities required for success in today’s global arena.  FSI promotes substantive, regional, and linguistic expertise, leadership finesse, personal resilience and innovative problem-solving.  FSI serves the U.S. Department of State and the entire U.S. government foreign affairs community as a strategic enabler of diplomatic excellence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Service Institute|url=https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=January 20, 2017|access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of the Foreign Service Institute is equivalent in rank to an [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]],&lt;ref name="FAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 290 Foreign Service Institute (FSI)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=September 8, 2014|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is appointed by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. The FSI Director is the Chief Learning Officer responsible for professional training for the U.S. Department of State and federal foreign affairs agencies.

== History ==
The Foreign Service Institute was first proposed as an in-service, graduate-level training institute for State Department employees and others in the Foreign Service. A number of different training schools and programs preceded the Foreign Service Institute, including the Consular School of Application (1907), the Wilson Diplomatic School (1909), the Foreign Service School (1924), the Foreign Service Officers' Training School (1931) and the Division of Training Services (1945).

In 1946, President Truman signed legislation that enabled Secretary of State George C. Marshall to establish the Institute on March 13, 1947. The Foreign Service Institute was initially authorized in Title VII of the [[Foreign Service Act]]. The issuance of Departmental orders fulfilling this section of the Act were delayed by the need to first resolve certain administrative issues. The orders were ultimately issued and, on March 13, 1947, Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] announced the establishment of the Foreign Service Institute.&lt;ref name="ADST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adst.org/2016/05/the-battle-to-create-the-foreign-service-institute/|title=The Battle to Create the Foreign Service Institute|access-date=March 24, 2017|publisher=[[Association of Diplomatic Studies and Training]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Foreign Service Institute opened in the Mayfair Building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. at 2115 C Street NW, a building that was subsequently razed for the new [[Harry S Truman Building|State Department headquarters]].&lt;ref name="AllGov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Service Institute|url=http://www.allgov.com/departments/department-of-state/foreign-service-institute?agencyid=7180|publisher=AllGov.com|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute included four schools: Basic Officer Training, Advanced Officer Training, Management and Administrative Training, and Language Training.&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt; FSI then moved to leased space in Rosslyn, Virginia until October 1993, when it relocated to its current home. In 1954, the Wriston Report criticized the resources and support being devoted to FSI, and in the following year, FSI overhauled its curriculum, adding longer specialized training, putting a greater emphasis on language training, and opening up courses to wives of Foreign Service Officers.&lt;ref name="AllGov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='WRISTON REPORT' OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp78-04718a000100250049-2|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1993, FSI moved to the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and remains headquartered there today.&lt;ref name="AllGov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Foreign Affairs Training Center 2017 Master Plan Update|url=https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/136234|publisher=[[General Services Administration]]|date=April 7, 2017|access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, FSI celebrated the 70th anniversary of its founding, with the [[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]] releasing an e-book in honor of its anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FSI at 70: Future Forward: A History of the Foreign Service Institute|last=Honley|first=Steven|publisher=Arlington Hall Press|date=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Foreign Service Institute currently has four schools: Leadership and Management, Language Studies, Professional and Area Studies, and Applied Information Technology, along with the Transition Center and an executive office for administrative functions.&lt;ref name="FAM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OIG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspection of the Foreign Service Institute|url=https://oig.state.gov/system/files/209366.pdf|publisher=[[Inspector General of the Department of State]]|date=March 2013|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Language Studies''' ('''SLS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 297 School of Language Studies (FSI/SLS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=December 23, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers instruction in more than 70 languages and proficiency testing in over 100 languages. Enrollments may be 8–44 weeks, depending on the difficulty of the language and the individual's proficiency objectives. The Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies also maintains a network of language field schools in Taipei, Yokohama, Seoul, and other regional programs in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia where a further 44 weeks of instruction is offered overseas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name="FAM"/&gt; Programs and courses of study also include self-study, early morning classes and distance learning courses. FSI is a co-creator of the speaking and reading language proficiency rating scales used throughout the U.S. government.  SLS is active within the U.S. government’s interagency community of language trainers and testers and frequently benchmarks with external foreign affairs agencies on language instruction.

The''' School of Professional and Area Studies''' ('''SPAS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 294 School of Area and Professional Studies (FSI/SPAS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=July 13, 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers training in foreign affairs specialties, such as consular, management tradecraft, political and economic affairs, public diplomacy, curriculum and staff development, office management, and orientation programs. It also offers guidance on the socio-cultural patterns, politics, economics, and international relations of world regions and individual countries. SPAS provides tailored programs in Consular, Economic and Commercial, Management, Office Management, Political, and Public Diplomacy, as well as new-hire orientation programs and in-depth Area Studies courses. SPAS is also home to the Center for the Study of the Conduct of Diplomacy (CSCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Department Leaders Inaugurate New ‘Lessons Learned’ Center|url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2016/02/state-department-leaders-inaugurate-new-lessons-learned-center/125673/|date=February 3, 2016|access-date=March 30, 2017|last=Clark|first=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines recent diplomatic experiences in order to capture best practices and lessons learned.  CSCD produces comparative analyses which are incorporated into FSI training and used to help prepare foreign affairs professionals at all ranks for the challenges faced at U.S. missions around the world.

The '''School of Applied Information Technology''' ('''SAIT''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 296 School of Applied Information Technology (FSI/SAIT)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=December 23, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is divided into four broad generalities: training to improve the business application skills of all employees, training in the technologies employed across the Department of State for IT professionals, IRM tradecraft courses that provide IT managers with broad IT management skills, and training for new Information Management Specialists and Information Management Technical Specialists to prepare them for initial and continued overseas employment with the Department.

The '''Leadership and Management School''' ('''LMS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 295 Leadership and Management School (FSI/LMS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=September 7, 2007|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers mandatory and elective leadership and management training for supervisors and managers from entry to executive levels; roundtables and policy seminars for senior leaders; and crisis management training overseas and at the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Dept’s Leadership and Mgt School Needs Some Leadership, And It’s Not Alone|url=https://diplopundit.net/2013/05/16/state-depts-leadership-and-mgt-school-needs-some-leadership-and-its-not-alone/|publisher=Diplopundit|date=May 16, 2013|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transition Center''' ('''TC''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 298 Transition Center (FSI/TC)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=December 23, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepares employees and their family members for effectiveness in the foreign affairs community throughout, and after, their careers. The Transition Center provides:

The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/general-history-of-africa/ '''General History of Africa''' ('''GHA''')] is a two-phase project undertaken by [[UNESCO]] from 1964 to the present. The 1964 General Conference of UNESCO, during its 13th Session, instructed the Organization to undertake this initiative after the newly independent African Member States expressed a strong desire to reclaim their cultural identity, to rectify widespread ignorance about their Continent’s history, and to break free of discriminatory prejudices. '''Phase One,''' which began in 1964 and was completed in 1999, consisted of writing and publishing eight volumes which highlight the shared heritage of the peoples of [[Africa]]. '''Phase Two,''' which began in 2009, focuses on the elaboration of history curricula and [[pedagogical]] materials for primary and secondary schools on the basis of the eight volumes of the GHA. Phase Two also focuses on the promotion of the use and harmonization of the teaching of this collection in higher education institutions throughout the Continent. Phase Two also concerns the implementation of these materials in schools in Africa and the [[Diaspora]]. The objective of both Phase One and Phase Two of the project is to re-appropriate the interpretation and writing of African histories and to demonstrate the contribution of African cultures past and present to the history of humanity at large.

==History==

:"My own background, the experience I gained as a teacher and as chairman... taught me how necessary it was for the education of young people and for the information of the public at large to have a history book produced by scholars with inside knowledge of the problems and hopes of Africa and with the ability to apprehend the Continent in its entirety."
:: - [[Amadou Mahtar M'Bow]], former Director General of UNESCO (1974-1987)
&lt;br /&gt;
The project encompasses two of UNESCO’s key priorities- Africa and Education. Africa, in terms of a response to urgent development needs at the national level and to accompany the regional integration process; and education because this issue is a fundamental human right and the very basis of development and responsible citizenry. African peoples expressed their desire to “decolonize” the history of their Continent in order to deconstruct the traditional prejudices and clarify the truth of the African past. The project also takes into consideration modern teaching tools, such as internet resources and multimedia platforms, to ensure that learning is an interactive discovery process. Africa was never cut off from the rest of the world, and benefitted from mutual exchange and influences with Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. The slave trade, slavery, and colonization had a considerable impact on the fragmentation of the Continent. The African Diaspora that resulted contributed in a significant manner to the creation of new cultures and societies. The Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa aims to develop curriculum that highlights the African contribution to the progress of Humanity, African shared values, interaction with the rest of the world.

In this perspective, the creation of the [[African Union]] (AU) and the implementation of the [[NEPAD]] philosophy of developing Africa-led solutions to African challenges offered a new and favorable context for a political leadership committed to African regional integration and provided a mechanism for addressing history teaching within the continent as a whole.  Furthermore, the Action Plan of the Second Decade for [[Education in Africa]] (2006 to 2015), which emphasizes the strengthening of the links between education and culture and improving the quality of pedagogical content, constitutes an ideal framework for the implementation of the project.

Article 7 of the Charter of African Cultural Renaissance adopted in 2006 in Khartoum at the Heads of State Summit stipulates that:&lt;br /&gt;
 
:“African States commit themselves to work for African Renaissance. They agree on the need for reconstruction of the historical memory and conscience of Africa and the African Diaspora. They consider that the general History published by UNESCO constitutes a valid base for teaching the History of Africa and recommend its dissemination, including in African languages, as well as the publication of its abridged and simplified versions for wider audiences.”
[[File:Conference 1.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Meeting for the General History of Africa]] [[File:Scientific Committee Meeting June 2010.JPG|thumb|right|2010 Scientific Committee Meeting for the General History of Africa]]{{-}}

==Phase One==
'''(1964–1999)''' Following their decolonization in the early 1960s, African countries expressed a strong desire to recover their ownership of their past and the production of knowledge regarding their heritage. The African member states of UNESCO were then called upon to re-affirm their cultural identities and reinforce the common aspiration to achieve African unity. Part of these efforts included combating certain preconceptions including the assumption that the lack of written sources made it difficult to engage in serious study or production of African history. The conventional reading of history also needed to be challenged in order to depict a more accurate picture of the African continent, of its cultural diversity, and its contribution to the general progress of humankind. Thus, at its 16th Session (1964), the General Conference of UNESCO invited the Director-General to undertake the elaboration of a General History of Africa. In this framework, the General History of Africa was written and published in eight volumes, with a main edition in English, French and Arabic. Additional publications have been produced in Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese. Furthermore, twelve studies and documents on related themes as well as an abridged version of the main edition in English, French, Kiswahili, Hausa and Fulfulde were published. This tremendous undertaking represented thirty five years of cooperation between three hundred and fifty experts from Africa and from the rest of the world.  This work involved some of the most eminent African scholars such as [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[Joseph Ki-Zerbo]], [[Theophile Obenga]], [[Ali Mazrui]], [[Gamal Mokhtar]], [[Bethwell A. Ogot]], etc.

The main preoccupation of Phase 1 was to provide a culturally relevant perspective based on an interdisciplinary approach with a focus on the history of ideas and civilizations, societies and institutions. To that end, it was envisaged to develop an African centered point of view using African sources, such as oral traditions, art forms and linguistics. It was decided as well to adopt a continental perspective of Africa as a whole avoiding the usual dichotomy between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. This shift in perspective is reflected by the significant number of renowned African scholars who contributed to this project as members of the International Scientific Committee, editors and authors.

To tackle this task, made all the more complex and difficult by the vast range of sources and the fact that documents were widely scattered, UNESCO had to proceed in stages. The first stages '''(1965 to 1969)''' consisted of gathering documentation and planning the work. Several meetings were held and campaigns were conducted in the field to collect oral traditions and establish regional documentation centers. In addition, several activities were undertaken: including the collection of unpublished manuscripts in Arabic and [[Ajami]] (manuscripts in African languages written with Arabic alphabet), the compilation of archival inventories and the preparation of a Guide to the Sources of the History of Africa, culled from the archives and libraries of a number of European and Asian countries and later published in nine volumes.

The second stage '''(1969 to 1971)''' was devoted to the deliberation of complex substantial and methodological questions raised by the compilation of the GHA. It was decided that the GHA should cover three million years of African history, in eight volumes, published in English, Arabic, French, and in African languages such as Kiswahili, Hausa, and Fulfulde.

The next stage '''(1971 to 1999)''' consisted of the drafting and publication. This began with the establishment of the International Scientific Committee to ensure the intellectual and scientific responsibility of the work and oversee the drafting and publication of the volumes. During this period, UNESCO organized scientific colloquia and symposia on topics related to the history of Africa most of which were overlooked by researchers. The results of these meetings were published in a series of books entitled “UNESCO Studies and Documents -The General History of Africa”. Twelve studies were published covering a wide range of subjects including: the Slave trade, relations between Africa and the Arab world, relations between Africa and the Indian Ocean,and the role of youth and women.

Bearing in mind that history teaching is instrumental in shaping peoples’ identities and in understanding the common ties underlying the cultural diversity in any region, and in order to implement one of the goals initially set for the General History of Africa by its initiators, UNESCO, in collaboration with the [[African Union Commission]], launched in March 2009,  Phase II of GHA entitled the “Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa” project.
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:General History of Africa Volumes.jpg|thumb|center|Eight volumes of the General History of Africa]]

==Phase Two==
'''(2009–present)''' In 2009 UNESCO launched the second phase of the project focusing on the implementation of the GHA entitled, the “Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa.” This phase, which constitutes a priority in the cooperation between UNESCO and the African Union, falls within the framework of the Action Plan of the Second Decade for Education in Africa (2006–2015). The Action Plan emphasizes the strengthening of the links between education and culture and improving the quality of pedagogical contents such as internet resources and audiovisual materials. It further corresponds to recommendations made following several meetings organized by UNESCO before and after the completion of the first phase of the GHA.

In order to successfully implement the second phase of the project, UNESCO has had to have the project validated by different African institutional and academic stakeholders including the Ministers of Education and various professional associations including historians, history teachers, pedagogues, et al. At the Ministers of Education of the COMEDAF meeting in November 2009, the African Ministers reaffirmed their support for the project and recalled the political leadership of the African Union on the Project. This continued cooperation between the Commission of the African Union and UNESCO has been necessary to facilitate the appropriation of the project.

The main objective of Phase Two, entitled "The Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa" is to contribute to the regenerating of the teaching of African history on the basis of the General History of Africa in African Union member States with the view to promote the African regional integration process. In particular, the project aims to:
* develop common content for use in African primary and secondary schools, for three different age groups (under 12, 13-16 and 17-19) as well as an historical atlas and an educational CD-Rom. The content could, if necessary, be adapted to local circumstances without changing the regional scope;
* improve teacher training in light of the latest findings in historical research and advances made in the methodology and methods of history teaching. A teachers’ guide will be elaborated and guidelines to reinforce initial and in-service training of primary and secondary school teachers will be defined.
* promote the teaching of and harmonize the use of the GHA in higher education institutions across the continent.

'''Implementation:'''&lt;br /&gt;
To implement the project, UNESCO established a ten-member Scientific Committee (SC) representing the five sub regions of the Continent, entrusted with the intellectual and scientific responsibility of the project. The committee members were designated by the Director General of UNESCO in February 2009 after a series of consultations held with different partners and stakeholders including: the African Union, the Africa Group of UNESCO, the donor country, the African Historian Association, the International Association of Historians, and members of the former International Scientific Committee established for the first phase of the Project. These members are:
Professor Alaa El-din Shaheen (Egypt), Professor Taieb El Bahloul (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Professor Sifiso Ndlovu (South Africa), Professor Amakobe Florida Karani (Kenya), Professor [[Adame Ba Konaré]] (Mali), Professor Jean Michel Mabeko-Tali (Congo), Professor Lily Mafela (Botswana), Professor Elikia M’bokolo (D.R. Congo), Professor Mamadou N’doye (Senegal), Professor Bahru Zewde (Ethiopia).

The aforementioned members were installed on February 24, 2009 in the framework of the Forum for African Regional and Sub-Regional Organizations to Support Cooperation between UNESCO and NEPAD (FORASUN) that took place in Tripoli (Libya) from February 20–24, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001839/183933e.pdf

== Background ==
Helping Minds is a group of about 200 volunteers, rendering academic and financial aid to rural poor students in [[Tamil Nadu]], helping scores to pursue engineering, medical and polytechnic courses. Every month, each member contributes a minimum of Rs 100, with proceeds donated to deserving poor students.

The trust extends financial help to students identified and validated by the members. Those having consistently very good academic records and hailing from poor families are given priority. Their assistance has helped scores of students pursue engineering, medicine, polytechnic, paramedical and other job-oriented courses. The beneficiaries have now settled in top jobs, members said.
    
During the past three years, the trust has donated around Rs 5.5 lakh to over 40 students, in addition to developing infrastructure in about ten government schools. Helping Minds Trust was awarded 'Unsung Heroes' award by PrimePoint Foundation, a city based NGO.

'''King Schools, Inc.''' is an American [[computer]] [[software]] company headquartered in [[San Diego, California]], USA.  The company focuses on the creation of [[Computer Based Training]] (CBT) or [[E-learning]], to assist individuals in obtaining all levels of [[Pilot certification in the United States]].  Over the years, the company has expanded its training courses to cover the various [[pilot certificates]], ratings and educational requirements, along with many aeronautical elective studies.  More recently, it has begun offering all of its courses in [[Web-based training]] (WBT) and mobile device formats.

King Schools was founded in 1975 by John and Martha King, husband and wife.  As [[Certified flight instructor|Certificated Flight Instructors]], the Kings first began as a traveling ground school, offering two-day courses in various cities.  A little more than a decade later, they began producing training videos that other flight instructors could incorporate into their own curriculum.  Eventually, demand for their videos by individuals learning to fly led to the development of courses that could be used for self-paced study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0305003 |title=Martha and John King: Practical Risk Management for Pilots |date=May 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707102454/http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0305003 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2010, King Schools has over 70 employees and operates exclusively from an {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility near [[Montgomery Field]].&lt;ref name="aboutking"/&gt;  Course development, production, customer service and shipping all occur at this location.  Course videos are filmed either in the in-house digital studio or at nearby Montgomery Field.

John and Martha King are two of the most recognized experts in flight instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstflightcentennial.org/100_Aviation_Heroes.html  | title = First Flight Foundation 100 Heroes of Aviation  | date = 2003-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?ContentBlockID=d4a19d2b-7eef-4f1a-aee1-712bf0384417&amp;Dynamic=1&amp;Range=WEEK&amp;FromDate=07/26/2007&amp;ToDate=08/02/2007&amp;Category=/index.cfm  | title = Aero-News.Net: Oshkosh Memories...

The company claims that more than half of all pilots in the United States have studied using one of their courses.  Of the courses they offer, the [[Private Pilot]] Knowledge Test Course is likely the most used, supporting [[FAA]] Part 61 ground schools.  Among the approximately 90 other courses offered, topics covered include Private Pilot, Instrument Pilot, Commercial Pilot, International Operations and risk management.  King Schools also produces the [[Cessna]]-branded courses used by Cessna Pilot Centers, which are Part 141 ground schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/pilot-technique/new-pilots/pilot-command-new-cessna-pilot-course  | title = Pilot in Command: The New Cessna Pilot Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* In 1975, King Schools, Inc. was started by John and Martha King as a touring 2-day ground school.
* In 1989, King Schools moves to its current facility in [[San Diego, California]], near [[Montgomery Field]]
* In 1999, King Schools produces the flight training videos for [[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000]], featuring John and Martha King providing personal instruction for virtual pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1999/11-01flight.mspx  | title = Flight Simulator 2000 Reaches New Heights | date = 1999-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, John and Martha King were inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flying Risk Awareness Advocacy==
In March 2001, [[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]] published an interview with John King titled "John King's Crusade to Change Aviation's Culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Lane|title=Battling the "Big Lie": John King's Crusade to Change Aviation's Culture|url=http://www.kingschools.com/news/BigLie.htm|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the article, John openly charged the General Aviation industry with mischaracterizing that light aircraft could be considered safe.  He argued that General Aviation pilots were insufficiently trained to recognize and address flight hazards.  King Schools later joined efforts with Avemco Insurance to produce a training video to do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avemco.com/Articles/OnApproach2004.pdf  | title = Avemco and King Schools: Risk Management, One Year Later | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, this led to the first in a series of training videos marketed by King Schools as a "Practical Risk Management" course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avweb.com/news/reviews/184109-1.html  | title = Surviving the Flight - Review of Practical Risk Management for Pilots | date = 2003-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language proficiency''' or '''linguistic proficiency''' is the ability of an individual to speak or perform in a [[language]]. As theories among pedagogues as to what constitutes proficiency go,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408094300/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions |date=April 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little consistency as to how different organizations classify it. Additionally, [[fluency]] and [[language]] [[Linguistic competence|competence]] are generally recognized as being related, but separate controversial subjects. In predominant frameworks in the [[United States]], proficient speakers demonstrate both accuracy and fluency, and use a variety of discourse strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429203232/http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf |date=April 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, native speakers of a language can be [[wikt:fluent|fluent]] without being considered proficient. Native-level fluency is estimated to be between 20,000 and 40,000 words, but basic conversational fluency might require only as little as 3,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109160341/http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency |date=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
===ACTFL===
The [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]] (ACTFL) distinguishes between proficiency and performance. In part, ACTFL's definition of proficiency is derived from mandates issued by the U.S. government, declaring that a [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] student is one who comes from a non-English background and "who has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language and whose difficulties may deny such an individual the opportunity to learn successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society".

ACTFL views "performance" as being the combined effect of all three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational.

==Proficiency frameworks==
Note that test scores may not correlate reliably, as different understandings of proficiency lead to different types of assessment:
*FSI Test ([[Foreign Service Institute]]) Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.edu/staff/globeg/ilrhome.shtml |title=ILR Scale |publisher=Utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(deprecated)''
*[[ILR scale|Interagency Language Roundtable]]  Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; ''(evolved from FSI)''
*[[Language Proficiency Index]]
*[[ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines]] ACTFL recognises ten different levels of proficiency: "novice", "intermediate", "advanced", and "superior", of which the first three are each subdivided into "low", "mid", and "high".
*[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] CEFR recognises six levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11819">A '''law  degree''' is an academic degree conferred for studies in [[law]]. Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority, they do not themselves confer a license. A legal license is granted (typically by examination) and exercised locally; while the law degree can have local, international, and world-wide aspects- e.g., in Britain the [[Legal Practice Course]] is required to become a British [[solicitor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/becomingasolicitor.law|title=Becoming a Solicitor|publisher=The Law Society (UK)|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/students.page|title=Solicitor's Regulation Authority Student and Training information|publisher=Solicitor's Regulation Authority|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) to become a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |title=How to Become a Barrister |publisher=The Bar Council (UK) |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218134750/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first academic degrees were all law degrees-and the first law degrees were [[doctorate]]s. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the [[glossators]] of the 11th century, which were schools of law.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, et al. (1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European university, that of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. It is from this history that it is said that the first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; And at the [[University of Bologna]] from its founding in the 12th century until the end of the 20th century the only degree conferred was the doctorate, usually earned after five years of intensive study after secondary school. The rising of the doctor of philosophy to its present level is a modern novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, A. (1921). "Training for the Public Profession of the Law, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15." Boston: Merrymount Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its origins, a doctorate was simply a qualification for a [[guild]]—that of teaching law.&lt;ref&gt;van Ditzhuyzen, R. (2005). [http://ugle.svf.uib.no/svfweb1/filer/1309.pdf The 'creatio doctoris': Diversity or convergence of ceremonial forms]? Unknown publisher. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Bologna]] served as the model for other law schools of the [[medieval]] age.&lt;ref&gt;García y García, A. (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA399&amp;lpg=RA1-PA399&amp;dq=bologna+doctor+title&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ov98N_ekq2&amp;sig=nAvm4JUEZJg389NCdSNfX1Gc-7s&amp;hl=en#PPP1,M1 "The Faculties of Law,"] [[A History of the University in Europe]], London: Cambridge University Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of [[Roman law]] (except for certain jurisdictions such as the Admiralty Court) and although the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] did teach [[canon law]] until the [[English Reformation]], its importance was always superior to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;García y García (1992), 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval Islamic [[madrasah]]s, there was a doctorate in the Islamic law of the [[Sharia]], called the ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa 'l-ifta']]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions").&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, G. (1989). "Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West," Journal of the American Oriental Society 109, 2, pp. 175–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of degrees==
The type of law degree conferred differs according to the jurisdiction.  Some examples include;

[[Image:Juris Doctor diploma.jpg|right|thumb|A typical Juris Doctor diploma from the United States, here from [[Suffolk University Law School]] in 2008.]]

* ''[[Bacharel em Direito]]'' (Bachelor of Laws) or ''[[Bacharel em Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais]]'' (Bachelor of Laws and Social Sciences), in [[Brazil]], is an undergraduate degree. The abbreviation for Bachelor is ''Bel.''. To be a Lawyer and be admitted at the [[Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil]] (Brazilian Bar Association), the Bachelor must be approved at the Brazilian Bar Exam, if the Selection and Registration Committee accept the new member he/she will be consider an [[Advogado]] (Attorney at Law/Advocate).
* [[Bachelor of Laws]] also referred to as a B.A. in Law (B.L.) or an LL.B. (Hons) in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.  It is an [[undergraduate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Langbein, “Scholarly and Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,” Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (B.C.L.) degree is similar in nature, historically distinguished from [[canon law]].
* [[Master of Laws]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Also referred to as an LL.M. from its Latin name, Legum Magister. It is an advanced academic degree pursued by those holding a professional law degree or a degree in a relevant field.
* ''[[Laurea]] di Dottore in Giurisprudenza'' for graduates before the [[Bologna Process]] reforms, or ''[[Laurea Magistrale]] in  Giurisprudenza'' after the [[Bologna Process]] reforms, in [[Italy]].  It is a masters level degree,&lt;ref&gt;See University of Ferrarra. [http://www.unife.it/giurisprudenza/ls.giurisprudenza Faculty of Law] (in Italian). Accessed January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however all graduates of Italian universities, even of the undergraduate degree, are authorized to use the title of "dottore" (Italian for doctor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/lexs/1938/lexs_112065.html Regio Decreto 4 giugno 1938, n.1269] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809170627/http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/lexs/1938/lexs_112065.html |date=2009-08-09 }}, Art. 48. (in Italian). Accessed February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Erstes Juristisches [[Staatsexamen]]'' is the equivalent to the law degree, since the second part ''(Zweites Juristisches Staatsexamen)'' is the German equivalent to the [[Bar exam]] in the U.S. At some universities you either become a "Lizentiat des Rechts (Licentiatus iuris)", a ''Magister iuris'' or a ''Diplom-Jurist''.  It is a master's-level degree.&lt;ref&gt;Free University of Berlin. [http://www.fu-berlin.de/studium/infoseite/abschluesse.html#exam Bachelor, Diploma and Staatsexamen] (in German). Accessed January 5, 2008.  See also [[Staatsexamen]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Juris Doctor]]'' (J.D.) in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] (also offered at some schools in [[Juris Doctor#Canada|Canada]], [[Juris Doctor#Australia|Australia]], and [[Juris Doctor#Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]).  It is a professional doctorate degree.&lt;ref&gt;Association of American Universities Data Exchange.

'''Dr Linda S. Siegel''' (born 1942) is an American-born psychologist and academic known for her research into the cognitive aspects of learning disabilities. She is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology, and Special Education at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, Canada where she held the Dorothy C. Lam Chair in Special Education.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of British Columbia]].

==Life and career==

Siegel was born in Washington, D.C., but grew up in New York City where her family moved when she was six years old. She received her B.A. in 1963 from [[Queens College, City University of New York]] and went on to post-graduate work at [[Yale University]] where she received her M.S.in 1964 and Ph.D. in 1966. Her doctoral dissertation was on information processing in children.&lt;ref name ="SRCD2"&gt;Stanovich, Keith (1993). [http://www.srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/OralHistory/siegel_linda_interview.pdf SCRD Oral History Interview: Linda Siegel]. [[Society for Research in Child Development]]. Retrieved 28 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SRCD1"&gt;[[Society for Research in Child Development]]. [http://www.srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/OralHistory/siegel_linda_cv.pdf Linda Siegel: ''Curriculum Vitae'']. Retrieved 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her appointment to the Dorothy C. Lam Chair in Special Education at the University of British Columbia in 1996, Siegel held posts at the [[University of Missouri Columbia]] in Missouri; Department of Psychiatry [[McMaster University Medical Centre]], in Hamilton, Ontario; and [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="SRCD1"/&gt; In 2004 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Gothenburg]] in Sweden and held the university's [[Kerstin Hesselgren]] Visiting Professorship for the academic year 2004/2005.&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, Claes-Olof (2007). [http://www.gu.se/digitalAssets/1265/1265641_1092277_HD_vid_GU_1907-2007__ny_version_.pdf ''Hedersdoktorer vid Göteborgs universitet under 100 år''], pp. 217–218. [[University of Gothenburg|Göteborgs universitet]]. Retrieved 28 May 2015 {{Sv icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel was awarded the 2010 [[Canadian Psychological Association]] Gold Medal for Distinguished Lifetime Contributions to Canadian Psychology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Psychological Association]]. [http://www.cpa.ca/aboutcpa/cpaawards/awarddescriptions CPA Award Descriptions and Past Recipients]. Retrieved 28 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 she became the first recipient of the ''Australian Journal of Learning Difficulties'' Eminent Researcher Award.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Journal of Learning Difficulties''. [https://www.ldaustralia.org/ajld-awardwinners.html Recipients of AJLD Awards]. Retrieved 28 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her most recent book, ''Understanding dyslexia and other learning disabilities'', was published by Pacific Educational Press in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|81206448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Siegel's earliest research was on human information processing which in the 1980s became increasingly focused on developmental disabilities, especially reading disability. Many of her most well-known papers are on the relationship between IQ and reading disability classification. Her research on that relationship has at times proved controversial.&lt;ref name ="SRCD2" /&gt; In her 2012 paper "Confessions and Reflections of the Black Sheep of the Learning Disabilities Field", Siegel presented evidence from her long-term research to support her contention "that the IQ score is unnecessary in the diagnosis of whether or not there is a learning disability". She also criticized as "very regressive", trends to demand testing for "'processing deficits', even though there is no evidence that processing deficits are useful for either diagnosis or remediation" of learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Linda (2012). [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ985896 "Confessions and Reflections of the Black Sheep of the Learning Disabilities Field"]. ''Australian Journal of Learning Difficulties'', Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 63-77. Retrieved 31 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel has been one of several academics who have criticized studies supportive of "brain training" programs and especially the [[Arrowsmith School|Arrowsmith program]] founded by [[Barbara Arrowsmith Young]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Sarah |last=Barmak|date=25 January 2013|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/brain/can-a-controversial-learning-program-transform-brains/article7871918/|title="Can a controversial learning program transform brains?".|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=F0E32C8DE94AD4925945F61F5307E241?sy=afr&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=1month&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=brs&amp;cls=18915&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SMH121105DQ3MD3DFVRD |agency= Financial Review - News Store |title= Experts question effectiveness of program |work= The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Siegel appeared in ''Fixing My Brain'', a 2008 [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] documentary, about the Arrowsmith program, although a portion of her highly critical commentary was removed prior to broadcast after Arrowsmith Young's lawyers threatened the CBC with a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M. F. (29 December 2008). [http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=a4b7618a-9eaf-4fbe-9dca-1e5e80290369 "Education expert calling her lawyer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115195529/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=a4b7618a-9eaf-4fbe-9dca-1e5e80290369 |date=2014-11-15 }}. ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. Retrieved 31 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works with overviews of Siegel's research include Brueggemann Taylor's 2014 book ''Diagnostic Assessment of Learning Disabilities in Childhood'' and the 2003 article by Hayman-Abello ''et al.'', "Human neuropsychology in Canada: The 1990s".&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann Taylor, Amber E.

== About LYRASIS ==

A non-profit membership organization committed to serving archives, libraries and museums of all types, LYRASIS was established in April 2009, with a collective history of legacy networks that dates back to 1936.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} 

LYRASIS is a 501 c 3 nonprofit membership organization whose mission is to support enduring access to the world’s shared academic, scientific and cultural heritage through leadership in open technologies, content services, digital solutions and collaboration with archives, libraries, museums and knowledge communities worldwide.

'''MV Brandanger''' delivered in 1949 is a general purpose cargo ship, previously owned by the Norwegian shipping company [[Westfal-Larsen]], from 1971 sold and became the school ship MV ''Petar Beron'' in [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]]. The vessel is currently considered taken back to Norway and preserved by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hos Riksantikvaren jobber vi planmessig, og skal frede et representativt utvalg fartøy. Men verneplanen peker blant annet på at vi mangler skip fra utenriksflåten. Her kan for eksempel «Brandanger» fra 1949, som nå fases ut som undervisningsfartøy i Bulgaria, være et eksempel på hva vi mangler. Men dette er et svært stort fartøy som vil tøye rammene for hva som er mulig i dag. Riksantikvaren kan uansett ikke eie fartøy, sier Småland.", translation: "At the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage we work methodically and we will preserve a representative selection of vessels. But the preservation plan points to that we lack ships from the merchant fleet. Here could for example ''Brandanger'' from 1949, that is now phased out as a school ship in Varna, Bulgaria, be an example of what we lack. But this is a very large vessel that will stretch the limits for what is possible today. The Directorate for Cultural Heritage can anyway not own the vessel, says Småland.", from the article [http://www.aftenposten.no/okonomi/utland/Kong-Olav-til-salgs-i-Myanmar-6978939.html ««Kong Olav» til salgs i Myanmar»], ''Aftenposten'', 30 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Martí funeral.jpg|thumb|right|Alejandro Marti and wife Mati Haik at the funeral of Fernando Martí]] --&gt;
'''Fernando Martí Haik''' ([[circa|c.]] 1994–2008) was the 14-year-old son of a wealthy sporting goods chain owner [[Alejandro Marti]], whose kidnapping and murder caused a national outrage in [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Kennedy | first= Duncan | title= Mexican fury grows at kidnappings | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7553633.stm | work= BBC News | date= 2008-08-11 | accessdate= 2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with some hoping that involvement of such a wealthy family might help draw attention to the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Bussey | first= Jane | title= Mexico mourns another kidnapping death | url= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/47821.html | work= McClatchy Newspapers | date= 2008-08-12 | accessdate= 2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder was noticeable for its implication of mid-level law enforcement officials in [[Mexico City]].

==Kidnap and murder==
Martí was driven in an armored BMW with a bodyguard to the [[British American School (State of Mexico)|British American School]] on June 4, 2008, when he was stopped at a roadblock by officers wearing uniforms of Mexico's [[Federal Investigations Agency]], the equivalent of the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Iliff | first= Laurence | title= Calderón proposes life sentence for police involved in kidnappings in Mexico | url= http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/mexico/stories/DN-kidnap_08int.ART.State.Edition2.4dddd5f.html | work= Dallas Morning News | date= 2008-08-08 | accessdate= 2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver was tortured by having his teeth pulled out and later killed, and the bodyguard was choked. The bodyguard survived and later implicated [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], including Jose Luis Romero, commander of the detective unit at [[Mexico City International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Althaus | first= Dudley | title= Kidnap-slaying spurs calls for police reforms / Two Mexico City officers accused in death of boy, 14 | url= http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2008_4607022 | work= Houston Chronicle | page= A10 | date= 2008-08-06 | accessdate= 2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 2008, the ransom of 5,135,000 pesos (about US$404.3K) was agreed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/91563.htmlo{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but  initially the official information was that a total of US$6 million was paid by all the Marti family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/161440.html&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of waiting on August 1, 2008, the body of Fernando Marti was found inside the trunk of a car that was left abandoned in the city. The case prompted public outrage in Mexico, and there has growing pressure to reintroduce [[capital punishment]].

==Criminal Investigation==
On June 17, 2009, the Subprocuraduría de Investigación Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), which specializes on criminal organized gangs, initiated an investigation for organized delinquency and kidnapping against the organization of La Flor (The Flower), thought to be responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Fernando Marti Haik.

On October 18, 2010, Alejandro Marti, now president of [[Mexico SOS]], published photos of the alleged criminals. By the time he did so, the "[[Procuraduria General de la Republica]]" (PGR) announced that $15,000,000 (about US$1,181,000) would be paid as a reward anyone who could provide reliable and useful information that contributes to the location, arrest or detention of these criminals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=281624&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandro Marti declared:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/10/18/alejandro-marti-publica-las-fotos-de-los-presuntos-asesinos-de-su-hijo | work=CNN | title=Alejandro Martí publica las fotos de los presuntos asesinos de su hijo | date=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''#NEWPALMYRA''' (Also known as the '''New Palmyra Project''') is an effort to reconstruct the ancient city of [[Palmyra]] as an immersive virtual environment, based on archaeological and other clues.  The project was started from photos [[Bassel Khartabil]] had been taking of Palmyra since 2005.  He began building models of the ancient city, with support from [[Al Aous Publishers]].   
In 2012, Khartabil was arrested, and the original project and open source files were lost.  Barry Threw took over as director of the project, renamed #NEWPALMYRA, and a community of developers, modelers, and archaeologists began collaborating to model, restore, and later recreate from scratch those historical structures captured on film and camera.

In 2015, ISIL captured Palmyra and began destroying some of its famous historical sites. In late 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] began contributing to the New Palmyra Project, sending archaeologists with cheap 3D cameras to capture any  further structures that ISIL might decide to destroy.

== 3D models ==
; Arch of Triumph&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/arch-of-triumph/|title=Arch of Triumph|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arch-of-triumph-3D-print.stl|thumb|right|100px|Arch of Triumph as a 3D model]]
One of the best known structures in Palmyra was the monumental Arch of Triumph (قوس النصر). Constructed during the reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193 to 211), it was sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[Hadrian]]’s arch. It was restored in the 1930s, and then destroyed completely during the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015.

Palmyra's main streets were not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the colonnade between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل), with two richly carved façades angled away from one another.

; Tetrapylon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/tetrapylon/|title=Tetrapylon|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tetrapylon-3D-Print.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A 3D-printed version of the Tetrapylon on display at [[Wikimania 2017]]]]
A square platform, each corner containing a group of four columns. This was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. Each column had a pedestal in its center that originally supported a statue. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.  Only one was undamaged in 1963 when the whole was restored with concrete. Destroyed again by [[ISIL]] on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/1210/ISIS-recaptures-Palmyra-A-fresh-assault-on-heritage-sites-video|title=ISIS recaptures Palmyra: A fresh assault on heritage sites?

; Temple of Bel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/temple-of-bel/|title=Temple of Bel|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bassel-bel-3.jpg|thumb|alt=Temple of Bel rendering|Temple of Bel rendering.|100x100px]]This ancient temple was dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Bel in 32 AD.  Bel was worshipped at Palmyra along with the moon god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.  The ruins of the temple were among the best preserved at Palmyra.  they were destroyed by ISIL in August, 2015.

; Roman theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/theater/|title=Roman Theater|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roman Theatre at Palmyra (المسرح الروماني بتدمر) dates to the time of Severus. Its remains were restored in the 20th century, and it served for a time as a venue for the annual Palmyra festival.  It was destroyed by ISIL in May 2015.

; Temple of Baal Shamin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/temple-of-baal-shamin/|title=Temple of Baal Shamin|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Temple of Baal Shamin dates to the 2nd century BC, and dedicated to the Canaanite sky deity. Its altar was built in 115 AD, and the temple was rebuilt in 131 AD. In the 5th century AD, it was converted to a church.  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

; Assad al-Lat statue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/asad-al-lat/|title=Asad Al-Lat|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asad Al-Lat.stl|thumb|right|100px|The [[Assad al-Lat statue]] 3D model]]
This was the first statue modeled by #rsssd (Re-Sculpting Syrian Statues Digitally).  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

== Reconstructions and exhibits ==
A 12-ton lifesize replica of part of the Arch of Triumph was carved into stone, from these models, and installed in London's Trafalgar Square in 2016.

A number of small artefacts were reconstructed and displayed at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/events/venice-biennale/|title=Venice Biennale|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10-foot model of part of the Tetrapylon, printed in a single piece, was unveiled at the April 2017 Creative Commons Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/3d-printed-tetrapylon-palmyra-syria-creative-commons-1.4090368|title=How a 3D-printed monument is helping an ancient Syrian city rise again|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-08-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular discussion ==
The project began to hold public events, partner with design groups and 3D printing shops, and receive press coverage starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/press/|title=#NEWPALMYRA|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York State College of Forestry at Cornell''' was a [[statutory college]] established in 1898 at [[Cornell University]] to teach scientific forestry. The first four-year college of forestry in the country, it was defunded by the State of New York in 1903, over controversies involving the college's forestry practices in the Adirondacks. Forestry studies continued at Cornell even after the college's closing.

==Background==
The idea of a Cornell Forestry school began with Colonel [[William F. Fox]], Superintendent of New York's state-owned forests during the mid-1890s. At that time, forestry research and education was conducted only in Great Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=2007-10-07 |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Governor [[Frank S. Black]] went on a fishing trip with a Cornell trustee and discussed Col. Fox's proposal, the suggestion was made that Cornell would be well-suited to implement the demonstration forest. Cornell President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] then began lobbying for a state-funded college, just as he had successfully advocated for a state-funded veterinary college in 1894. The legislature quickly approved the new college.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 122 of the Laws of 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The act authorized New York State to pay for a tract of forest land in the Adirondacks from funds, previously appropriated for the acquisition of lands to be held "forever wild" in the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Alfred Lee,(1921) A History of the Adirondacks, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; with Cornell holding title, possession, management, and control for 30 years.  After 30 years, the land would revert to the State. Schurman recruited German trained, Dr. [[Bernhard Fernow|Bernhard E. Fernow]], who was then the 3rd Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]]) and one of the top forestry experts in the United States, to be the first Dean of the college.

Fernow moved quickly to acquire a tract of land to serve as a demonstration forest and purchased some.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Fernow's plan called for [[clearcutting]] the forestland at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. He contracted with the [[Brooklyn Cooperage Company]] to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods. The years 1899, 1903, and 1908 were terrible years for forest fires in the Adirondacks. Many, tens of thousands of acres were consumed by forest fires. Most fires were started by sparks or embers flying from coal-burning locomotive stacks and landing on [[logging slash]]. [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on [[Lower Saranac Lake]], branded locomotives as "instruments of arson."&lt;ref&gt;Angus,Christopher. The extraordinary Adirondack journey of Clarence Petty: wilderness guide, pilot, and conservationist, p. 17, [[Syracuse University Press]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst sin of the lumbermen was the fire menace that they left behind, and which caused incalculable destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas,Howard. Black River in the  North Country, p.89, Prospect Books,1963&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless,  Fernow had a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the Brooklyn Cooperage Company facility. The company turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into [[methanol]] and [[charcoal]], through a process called [[destructive distillation]]. Historic charcoal kiln photo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Milky Way Over Abandoned Kilns |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To his credit, Fernow established the first tree nursery in New York State at Axton, the site of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town. But most of the non-native conifer species he planted, such as [[norway spruce]], did not do well for many years, with a denuded area as a result. Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's arrogant disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.&lt;ref&gt;Gove, B. 2005. ''Logging railroads of the Adirondacks''. Syracuse University Press. pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Fernow's actions drew criticism also from Adirondack guides such as Ellsworth Petty (father of [[Clarence Petty]]), who protested the plan and, in a letter writing campaign, successfully lobbied the State to assign a special "Committee of the Adirondacks" to tour the Axton site. In its findings, the commission concluded that "the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting silvicultural experiments."&lt;ref name="Christopher 2002. p 31"&gt;Christopher, Angus. 2002. ''The Extraordinary Adirondack Journey of Clarence Petty'', p 31. Syracuse University Press {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence==

In  1898, the New York State College of Forestry opened at Cornell, which was the first forestry college in North America.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;  Because some of the students were transfer students, even though the College had a four-year curriculum, it graduated students during each of the five years of its operation, and the demand for students with Cornell forestry degrees exceeded the supply.  It also offered an optional  fifth year for a professional masters in forestry degree.

In 1899, Fernow had been recruited as a member of New York's [[E.H. Harriman]] expedition to Alaska, along with fellow Cornellian [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]. The expedition set sail from Seattle on May 31, 1899, aboard the refitted steamer, the ''George W. Elder''. "[Fernow's] research on the expedition was hampered by the fact that the coastal itinerary never gave him a look at the inland forests. His overview thus limited, he concluded that Alaska would never be a great source of timber: the wood was inferior and the conditions of lumbering too difficult. Some say that history has proven him wrong, but his opinion did have an effect: for a time, it discouraged commercial interests from prospecting for timber in the Alaskan forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/harriman/1899/1899_part/participantfernow.html |title=Harriman: Bernhard Fernow |publisher=PBS |date=1923-02-06 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Fernow founded and became editor-in-chief of  the ''[[Journal of Forestry]]'', the pioneering scholarly journal in this field.

The demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3FNnwghrFu&amp;sig=aVmNAw0naLbeOJqb9l1Gyk4E0Eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QpejSuORNoTYsQOvlImNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&amp;f=false|title=''A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2''|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202–207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. The contract proved to be profitable and beneficial only for the company. Cornell gained insufficient funds to replant the clear-cut areas. A lawsuit was filed, naming the Brooklyn Cooperage Company as defendant with the People of New York State as plaintiff. (See ''[[People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company]]''.)

Although the legislature had adopted the 1903 appropriation without debate,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Governor [[Benjamin B. Odell]] made a [[pocket veto]] of funds for the school. In his statement, Governor Odell said: "The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits. I deem it wise therefore to withhold approval of this item until a more scientific and more reasonable method is pursued in the forestry of the lands now under the control of Cornell University."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Z. Lincoln, ed. 1910. ''Messages from the Governors, X''. Albany, p.555, as cited in ''Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University'', 1963, by Gould P. Colman, p.161, Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifice of College of Forestry for the College of Agriculture==

Dean Bailey and Dean [[Bernhard Fernow]], of the Forestry College were the best of friends.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} In fact, on that night in May 1903 when the telegram arrived announcing Governor Odell's veto of the annual appropriation for the College of Forestry, Bailey and Fernow were together at a dance. Despite the bad news, the dance went on. Fernow did not want to let the veto end his school, and he continued to work without a salary.  He proposed continuing the school by charging tuition to the students.  (During this time, New York State students attended the College tuition-free.) However, Cornell's Board of Trustees and President Schurman (despite Bailey's urgings to the contrary) decided to close the doors of the Forestry College. In June, 1903, instruction in the College ceased and the faculty was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05EEDB1339E333A2575BC1A9609C946297D6CF|title=CORNELL SCHOOL OF FORESTRY SUSPENDED.; Action Followed Failure of State to Provide Means for Its Support.|work=New York Times|date=June 18, 1903|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rumored, and with good reason, that a political bargain took place exchanging the College of Forestry, for the establishment of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell University in 1904. To quote Liberty Hyde Bailey, "Last winter at Albany I was confronted by inquiries which indicated that the State would be willing to give to either a College of Forestry or a College of Agriculture, but not to both."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University,1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 162, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the legislative session of 1904 began in Albany, a most unexpected mishap occurred: at a hearing before the Federal Commission on Agriculture in Washington, the Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson, attacked Cornell for not teaching "Soil Physics" and took the occasion to revive the old canards about Cornell misusing the riches conferred by the [[Morrill Act]]. He said of Cornell: "They were better endowed than any institution in the land, yet never did anything." Cornell's President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] demanded a hearing and spoke in Washington with his usual brilliance, refuting the Secretary point by point.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, in Albany, Senator Ed Stewart of Ithaca introduced a bill drafted by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]],establishing the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell. Leading the opposition was Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] of Syracuse University. According to Schurman, "the Chancellor led a pious army, the Methodists of the state. He was an angry man; his words breathe a rancor too hot to be contained by facts." He charged that [[Ezra Cornell]] had so "manipulated" the proceeds of the Morrill Act that more than four-fifths were improperly used. He demanded a share in state bounty equal to that accorded Cornell: "Either give to all or not to any!"&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"&gt;Bishop, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Bailey broadcast an immediate refutation, but Chancellor Day had already had his speech published by the Syracuse University Press without change. The Chancellor asked for a hearing before the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee. This request granted, he spoke at the hearing but the chairman and other legislators were insufficiently attentive to him, the Chancellor broke off in a fury and left the room,"before he had adduced a single coherent argument." Dean Bailey, later put up a picture of Chancellor Day, in his office, with the subscription: "Founder of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell."&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"/&gt;
  
The announcement of the final passage and signing of the bill, in Albany, creating the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell was met with bonfires and the pealing of church bells in Ithaca. However, the price for this new state support at Cornell was the sacrifice of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;Colman,p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The lawsuit, ''People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company'', was decided in favor of the People, and again on appeal in 1906;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E2D71F3DE633A25750C1A9619C946797D6CF|title=Cornell Forestry Case: Appellate Division Decision Against Brooklyn Cooperage Company|work=New York Times|page=4|date=July 13, 1906|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case defined forestry in the United States for a generation. The {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of forest lands were placed under the "forever wild" protection of the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]]. At the conclusion of the case, constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]] stated, "I hold before me the decision in the case of the People against the Brooklyn Cooperage Company.....the consequence of that was that this 'tremendous' tract of thirty thousand acres was to be cut down 'flat' from one end of it to the other, in order that the scientific foresters might start a new forest which might mature a hundred years from the time that that contract was entered into. This is scientific forestry?".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reznikoff, Charles, ed., ''Louis Marshall: Champion of Liberty. Selected Papers and Addresses''. 2 vols. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1957., page 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, [[Bernhard E. Fernow]] became the first professor of forestry in a four-year baccalaureate degree program at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], in State College, after having been the nation's first consulting forester since leaving Cornell and Ithaca in 1903. His office was in New York City. After teaching the 1907 spring semester at Penn State, Dr. Fernow left to become the first head of the Faculty of Forestry at the [[University of Toronto]]. He gave as a reason for leaving Penn State his argument with Dr.[[Joseph Rothrock]] that [[Penn State Mont Alto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm |title=Penn State Mont Alto: Our History |publisher=Ma.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226102802/http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; should not have departed from its role as a "ranger school" to pursue higher aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys1muh3jqXsC&amp;dq=A+century+of+forest+resources+education+at+Penn+State:+serving+our+forests+...++By+Henry+D.+Gerhold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5dZR-SoqGO&amp;sig=gClSfVwnlH6LRXDb5USxCJl0dTk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j3THSuWmB8yY8AaU0KXhCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=bernhard%20fernow&amp;f=false |title=A Century of Forest Resources Education at Penn State: Serving Our Forests ... - Henry D.

It was one of three forestry schools in the nation in 1903, after Yale and Biltmore, respectively.

[[File:Cornell Fernow Hall September 2008.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Fernow Hall|Fernow Hall on the Cornell Campus.]]

In 1910, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], the Dean of Cornell's Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school.  At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named [[Fernow Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Fernow Hall]]. That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources. In 1927, Cornell established a {{convert|1639|acre|km2|adj=on}} research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

In 1911, the State Legislature established a [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at [[Syracuse University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not without opposition from Cornell University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B1FFA3B5F13738DDDAD0994DD405B838DF1D3&amp;scp=18&amp;sq=new%20york%20state%20college%20of%20forestry,syracuse&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=OPPOSES FORESTRY SCHOOL; Cornell Against $310,000 Appropriation for Syracuse Department | date=May 14, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the NYS [[Board of Regents]] questioned the need for duplicate, state-supported forestry programs at Cornell and Syracuse. A formal study resulted in an agreement in 1937 that the Syracuse program would be the only place for professional undergraduate training in forestry. Cornell's Department of Forestry continued with courses in "farm" forestry, to [[cooperative extension]] work in forestry, and to research and graduate education.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; In an exchange, [[Syracuse University]] agreed to abandon its School of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2013/01/syracuse_universitys_history_a.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies, but ESF does not have a veto power over competing new programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2010-12-18| author=Peter D.

==Forestry Studies continue at Cornell==

Forestry continued at Cornell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/cornellag/cornellag_9.html |title=Liberty Hyde Bailey - A Man for All Seasons |publisher=Rmc.library.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
with Dean [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] adding a Department of Forestry to  the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University]] in 1910-11.

The world-famous [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]] was the brainchild of Professor [[Arthur A. "Doc" Allen]], beginning in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scricciolo.com/in.memoriam.A.A.Allen.pdf Pettingill, Olin Sewall Jr. 1968. "In Memoriam: Arthur A.

Cornell’s vertebrate museum’s fishes collection is particularly strong with great diversity in North American fishes, and minnows in particular. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s the fish collection was greatly expanded thanks to collections made by renowned Cornell ichthyologist Edward Raney and his students.

The Cornell [[Hortorium]] founded by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1935, has historically been the major U. S. center for the systematics of cultivated plants.&lt;ref&gt;https://plantbio.cals.cornell.edu/hortorium&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/hortorium/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in the footsteps of the great [[botanist]] and [[horticulturist]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], a most extraordinary [[plant physiologist]], [[Frederick Campion Steward]], arrived to teach and conduct research at Cornell University in 1950, as Professor of Botany. From his Cornell classrooms and laboratories, Steward was responsible for creating and inspiring a generation of botanists.

In 1978, the [[Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]] relocated to the Ithaca campus from its original site in Yonkers, NY. Its history is extremely interesting and relevant.&lt;ref name=bti1&gt;[http://bti.cornell.edu/index.php?page=AboutUs&amp;section=History#page=Overview "History of BTI," Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bti&gt;[http://bti.cornell.edu/ Homepage, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell University was a founding member of the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest]] Research Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://hubbardbrookfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hubbardbrookfoundation.org/about-hbrf/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hubbardbrook.org/overview/resphilos.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cornellpines.blogspot.com/2010/10/24-heroes-raphael-zon-class-of-1901.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Raphael Zon]], Director, Lake States Forest Experiment Station, United States Forest Service.
“Reprinted with revised Bibliography, 1927, from Appendix V of the Final Report of the National Waterways Commission, 1912. (Senate Document No. 469, 62d Congress, 2d Session)”

“Object of the Report”

“ Of all the direct influences of the forest the influence upon the supply of water in streams and upon the regularity of their flow is the most important in human economy. Yet so many are the factors which play related parts in this influence, so great is the difficulty of observing them with precision, and so wide the range of economic interests affected, that considerable divergence of opinion has arisen on the subject. This, however, if prompted by a sincere desire to reach the bottom of a complicated and vital problem, can only be productive of results of the highest scientific value.”

“ There is, perhaps no other problem facing the American people to-day which demands such care in the scientific accuracy of its data and conclusions as does the relation between forests and water. It is imperative, therefore, that no final conclusions be drawn in regard to this relation until ample, reliable, and critically revised evidence upon which to base them is available. A national policy which, though considering the direct value of forests as a source of timber, fails to take full account also of their influence upon erosion, the flow of streams, and climate, may easily endanger the well-being of the whole people.” (page 1)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/labs/awae_flagstaff/Hot_Topics/SierraAnchaEF/publications/hibbert_fortrtmnteffectswateryield.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9613">'''Official multilingualism''' is the policy adopted by some [[State (polity)|states]] of recognizing multiple [[language]]s as [[Official language|official]] and producing all official documents, and handling all [[communication|correspondence]] and official dealings, including [[court]] procedure, in these languages. It is distinct from personal [[multilingual]]ism, the capacity of a person to speak several languages.

==States with policies of official bilingualism==

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|Languages of Afghanistan}}
[[Afghanistan]] uses [[Dari language|Dari]] (or Afghan [[Persian language|Persian]]) and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] as official languages. Many citizens are bilingual. These two languages account for 85% of Afghanis' native tongues.&lt;ref name="affactbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date=August 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belarus===
{{see also|Languages of Belarus}}
In [[Belarus]], [[Russian language|Russian]] is far more common than [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and Section 17 of the [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution]] designates both as official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/belarusian.shtml |title=Languages across Europe. |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
{{see also|Languages of Burundi}}
The official languages of [[Burundi]] are the local [[Kirundi language]] as well as the colonial French.

===Cameroon===
{{See also|Languages of Cameroon}}
[[Cameroon]] is extremely diverse linguistically and uses English and French as official languages.

===Canada===
{{Main|Bilingualism in Canada}}
{{See also|languages of Canada}}
In Canada [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]  have  special legal status over other languages in Canada’s courts, [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html|title=Official Languages Act - 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work=Act current to July 11th, 2010|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] is the only official bilingual province, while [[Quebec]] is the only province where French is the sole official language. The remaining provinces have English as the only official language. In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some bilingual services and some education in both official languages up to the high school level. English and French are official languages in all three territories (because they are federally administered). In addition, [[Inuktitut]] is also an official language in [[Nunavut]], and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the [[Northwest Territories]].

===Central African Republic===
{{see also|Languages of the Central African Republic}}
Out of 120 languages spoken in the [[Central African Republic]], French and the [[Ngbandi language|Ngbandi-based]] creole [[Sango language|Sango]] are official.

===Chad===
{{see also|Languages of Chad}}
Citizens of [[Chad]] speak over 120 languages, and the standardized [[Chadian Arabic]] serves as the lingua franca with colonial language French also being official.

*[[Cook Islands]]

===Cyprus===
{{see also|Languages of Cyprus}}
Island nation of [[Cyprus]] has had [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as its languages since the 1960 [[Constitution of Cyprus|Constitution]] (Article 3, section 1). The usage of either language is complicated by the political dispute that lead to the creation of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

*[[Djibouti]]
*[[East Timor]]

===Finland===
{{see also|Languages of Finland}}
In Finland, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are both considered "national languages". Municipalities of Finland are divided into three categories: unilingual Swedish, unilingual Finnish or bilingual. Finnish is the maternal language of about 90% of the population, and the bilingual or swedophone population is concentrated to the coastal areas of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] and [[Southwest Finland]]. The autonomous province of [[Åland]] is officially unilingual (Swedish). Both Swedish and Finnish are compulsory school subjects.

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Bilingualism in Hong Kong}}
{{see also|Languages of Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong is officially bilingual. Both English and Cantonese are official languages.

===Philippines===
{{see also|Languages of the Philippines}}
The [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippine constitution]] designates [[Filipino language|Filipino]] as the national language and – along with English – as official languages. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the national and official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It remained, along with English, as a de facto official language until removed in 1973 by a constitutional change. After a few months it was re-designated an official language by [[presidential decree]] and remained official until 1987, when the [[1987 Constitution|present Constitution]] removed its official status.&lt;ref name="official languages"&gt;Article XIV, Section 3 of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1935-constitution.html 1935 Philippine Constitution] provided, "[...] Until otherwise provided by law, English and Spanish shall continue as official languages." The [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1943-constitution.html 1943 Philippine Constitution] (in effect during occupation by Japanese forces, and later repudiated) did not specify official languages. Article XV, Section 3(3) of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1973-constitution.html 1973 Philippine constitution] ratified on January 17, 1973 specified, "Until otherwise provided by law, English and Pilipino shall be the official languages.

Article XIV Section 7 of the [http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-xiv/ 1987 Philippine Constitution] specified, "For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voluntary and optional"&gt;'''Article XIV, Sec 7''': For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English.

Some people in native Tagalog areas are bilingual, while in non-Tagalog areas it is common to be multilingual in Filipino, English, and in one or more of the regional [[Languages of the Philippines|language]]s, or as in other cases in languages such as Spanish, [[Southern Min|Minnan]] ([[Hokkien]]), and Arabic due to factors such as ancestry and religion. Eleven regional languages are recognised by the government as auxiliary official languages in their respective regions, while 90+ other languages and dialects are spoken by various groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">An '''organizational-activity game''' (OAG) is kind of game designed to facilitate organisational change. It is for this reason it is described as a development game, rather than a [[brainstorming]] or [[Role-playing game]]. Generally the game is designed to deal a specific predetermined concrete problem. They were devised by [[Georgy Shchedrovitsky]] of the [[Moscow Methodological Circle]]. He brought together various people involved in [[Research and Development]]  under the auspices of the USSR [[Academy of Pedagogy]].&lt;ref name="Naumov"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naumov|first1=S. B.|title=Organizational-activity Games|url=http://www.fondgp.ru/lib/collections/archive/ing/0|website=www.fondgp.ru|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity games are distinguished from the earlier action games by being open, i.e. based on flexible scenarios rather than pre-conceived solutions.&lt;ref name="Liborakina"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A bridge between past and future | author=Liborakina, Marina | journal=The Simulation and Gaming Yearbook | year=1994 | volume=4 | pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
The first OAG was held in 1979. One of the first games was the Ural Region Game which was devised to formulating a plan as regards how best to achieve the target set forth in the state production plan. By 1987 50 large and more than 100 small games had been conducted.&lt;ref name="Naumov"/&gt;

==Post Soviet OAGs==
OAGs were used  substantially following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].

===Use by non-governmental organisations===
Non governmental organisations (NGOs) emerged in Russia in the mid 1990s and provided the context for the application of OAGs.&lt;ref name="Liborakina"/&gt; The [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] and the Feminist Orientation Center jointly organised some activity games in 1994-5. These were funded by the [[Eurasia Foundation]] and took place in [[Tomsk]], [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref name="Liborakina"/&gt; There were also two sessions in Moscow at the beginning and the end of the project. There were over 150 participants drawn from over 80 NGOs.&lt;ref name="Liborakina"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5792">'''Problem-posing education''' is a term coined by Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]] in his 1970 book ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''. Problem-posing refers to a method of teaching that emphasizes critical thinking for the purpose of liberation. Freire used problem-posing as an alternative to the [[banking model of education]].

==Origins==

Freire's pedagogy emerged from his observations and experiences working as an instructor in literacy programs with peasant laborers in Brazil. During this work, Freire became aware of the economic, political, and social domination resulting from paternalism. Paternalism leads to a culture of silence, which keeps people from confronting their oppression. He turned this philosophy to pedagogy because "the whole education system was one of the major instruments for the maintenance of this culture of silence."&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;Paulo Freire, ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. 1970. Pg 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Freire's philosophy of education centers on [[critical consciousness]], whereby the oppressed recognize the causes of their oppression "so that through transforming action they can create a new situation, one which makes possible the pursuit of fuller humanity."&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Problem-posing education is the path to critical consciousness.

Freire's work has its roots in the [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] theory of learning, and specifically the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The constructivist theory holds that knowledge is constructed by individuals by using their experiences, which is what Freire drew upon in developing his pedagogy. In ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' Freire wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Education as the practice of freedom—as opposed to education as the practice of domination—denies that man is abstract, isolated, independent, and unattached to the world; it also denies that the world exists as a reality apart from people. Authentic reflection considers neither abstract man nor the world without people, but people in their relations with the world.&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;{{rp|81}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philosophy==

The philosophy of problem-posing education is the foundation of modern critical pedagogy.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"&gt;Peter McLaren, "A Pedagogy of Possibility: Reflecting Upon Paulo Freire's Politics of Education" 1999. Pg 51&lt;/ref&gt; Problem-posing education solves the student–teacher contradiction by recognizing that knowledge is not deposited from one (the teacher) to another (the student) but is instead formulated through dialogue between the two.&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;{{rp|76}} Freire's argument concludes that "authentic education is not carried on by "A" ''for'' "B" or by "A" ''about'' "B," but rather by "A" ''with'' "B.".&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;{{rp|76}} The representation of knowledge rather than the imposition of it leads to liberation.

==Method==

As a method of teaching, problem-posing involves "listening, dialogue, and action."&lt;ref&gt;Nina Wallerstein, "Problem-Posing Education: Freire's Method for Transformation", in ''Freire for the Classroom'', Edited by Ira Shor. 1987. Pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; Many models for applying problem-posing in the classroom have been formulated since Freire first coined the term.

One of the most influential models is the book ''Freire for the Classroom: A Sourcebook for Liberatory Teaching'', edited by [[Ira Shor]]. When teachers implement problem-posing education in the classroom, they approach students as fellow dialoguers, which creates an atmosphere of hope, love, humility, and trust.&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;{{rp|72}} This is done through six points of reference. Dialoguers (students/teachers) approach their acts of knowing as grounded in individual experience and circumstance.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"/&gt; They approach the historical and cultural world as a transformable reality shaped by human ideological representations of reality.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"/&gt; Learners make connections between their own conditions and the conditions produced through the making of reality.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"/&gt; Learners/Dialoguers consider the ways that they can shape this reality through their methods of knowing. This new reality is collective, shared, and shifting.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"/&gt; Learners develop literacy skills that put their ideas into print, thus giving potency to the act of knowing.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"/&gt; Finally, learners identify the myths dominant discourse and work to destabalize these myths, ending the cycle of oppression.&lt;ref name="Possibility 1999. Pg 51"/&gt;

==Examples==

The [[Montessori method]], developed by [[Maria Montessori]] is an example of problem-posing education in an early childhood model.

[[Ira Shor]], a professor of Composition and Rhetoric at CUNY, who has worked closely with Freire, also advocates a problem posing model in his use of [[critical pedagogy]]. He has published on the use of contract grading, the physical set-up of the classroom, and the political aspects of student and teacher roles.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Shor, "When Students Have Power: Negotiating Authority in a Critical Pedagogy" 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James D. Kirylo]], in his book, ''[[Paulo Freire: The Man from Recife]]'', reiterated Freire's thought, and stated that a problem-posing education is one where human beings are viewed as conscious beings who are unfinished, yet in process of becoming.

Other advocates of problem-posing critical pedagogy include [[Henry Giroux]], [[Peter McLaren]], and [[bell hooks]].

A '''rondo''' is a type of [[game]], similar to [[keep away]], that is used as a [[training]] [[physical exercise|drill]] in [[association football]] (soccer). In a rondo, one group of players is tasked with keeping [[possession (sports)|possession]] of the ball while completing a series of [[Passing (association football)|passes]], while a smaller group of players (sometimes a single player) tries to take possession.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Dave|title=What is a Rondo in soccer?|url=https://www.soccercoachweekly.net/soccer-drills-and-skills/what-is-a-rondo-in-soccer/|website=Soccer Coach Weekly|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rondos take place in close proximity, with the possessing group often circled around the opposing group.&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Jon|title=The Allure of the Rondo|url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2014/09/01/the-allure-of-the-rondo/|website=These Football Times|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other possession games, in a rondo, players occupy predetermined [[position (team sports)|positions]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Stan|title=Rondo: A simple practice game with multiple benefits|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/50661/rondo-a-simple-practice-game-with-multiple-benefi.html|website=SoccerAmerica|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rondos are said to improve player decision making, coordination, team play, creativity, competitiveness, and physical conditioning.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; The exercise is used by major football organizations including [[FC Barcelona]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], and has been credited with remaking the modern game.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

Dutch player and coach [[Johan Cruyff]], who implemented the rondo at Barcelona, described the drill: "Everything that goes on in a match, except shooting, you can do in a rondo. The competitive aspect, fighting to make space, what to do when in possession and what to do when you haven’t got the ball, how to play ‘one touch’ soccer, how to counteract the tight marking and how to win the ball back."&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt; Barcelona played one of their most famous rondos prior to the [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final]], in which they roundly defeated [[Manchester United]].&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

'''Scott Foresman''' is an [[elementary school|elementary educational]] publisher for [[PreK]] through [[Sixth grade|Grade 6]] in all subject areas. It is owned by [[Pearson Education]].

==Company history==
'''Scott Foresman and Company''' was founded in 1896 by [[Erastus Howard Scott]], Editor and President; [[Hugh A. Foresman]], Salesman and Secretary; and his brother, [[William Coates Foresman]], Treasurer. However, the company's origins extend back several years earlier.

E. H. Scott started in business in 1889, when he and C. J. Albert of the Albert Teachers Agency formed a partnership, "Albert and Scott". During this early period, the company occupied less than {{convert|100|sqft|m2}} in an office on Wabash Avenue in Chicago. The company’s first publication was ''Bellum Helveticum'', a [[high school]] [[Latin]] [[textbook]], copyright 1889.

In 1894, Hugh Foresman purchased the interest of Mr. Albert and joined E. H. Scott. The following year, the corporation Albert and Scott purchased the publishing business, rights, and stock of George Sherwood and Company, which also published textbooks. Also in 1895, the firm moved its business to larger quarters at 307 S. Wabash Avenue in Chicago. On February 13, 1896, W. Coates Foresman decided to join the business, and the corporate name was changed to Scott, Foresman and Company. That same year, the young company purchased S. C. Griggs and Company, whose catalogue included a long list of miscellaneous books, among which was ''[[Robert’s Rules of Order]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = xlv|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the company had been in business for only one year, it secured its first large state adoption. In 1897, the state of [[Kansas]] awarded Scott, Foresman and Company a five-year contract for eight publications. The following year, the firm moved to 623 South Wabash Avenue. In 1898, Hugh Foresman was elected Vice President. At this time, the company decided to publish books in the elementary field. In 1908 it recruited RC McNamara as office manager from Princeton University who ran a cooperative store at Princeton which became the University Store. The business plan of the U-Store today is pretty much the same one that he devised in 1905 at age 24.

The [[Dick and Jane]] series began in the 1930s and was the creation of [[Zerna Sharp]], a Scott, Foresman reading consultant. In 1966, Scott, Foresman moved from Chicago into its current location in [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview, Illinois]] designed by [[Jeffery Finkle]] and a new [[distribution center]] was opened in [[Pinola, Indiana|Pinola]], [[Indiana]]. Scott, Foresman became a [[Public company|public corporation]] and was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], but the company was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 1985.

[[William Morrow and Company]] was acquired by Scott, Foresman in 1967, but it was sold to the [[Hearst Corporation]] in 1981. Scott Foresman acquired [[South-Western Publishing]] the same year, which it owned until its 1986 sale to [[Cengage Learning|International Thomson]].

In 1986, [[Time Inc.]] bought Scott, Foresman. Around that time the comma was dropped from the company's name. Three years later, Time sold Scott Foresman to [[HarperCollins]], the book publishing subsidiary of [[News Corporation]]. In 1998, News Corp sold the brand to [[Pearson PLC]], the global publisher and owner of ''Penguin'' and the ''Financial Times''. Then Scott Foresman, along with more than 100 other educational brands, merged to become ''Pearson'', with Scott Foresman adopting the new name, Pearson Scott Foresman.

Scott Foresman were well known for their publications of the popular Thorndike Barnhart range of school dictionaries, namely the ''Scott Foresman Advanced Dictionary'', ''Scott Foresman Intermediate Dictionary'', and ''Scott Foresman Beginning Dictionary'' also published as the ''Thorndike Barnhart Student Dictionary'', the ''Thorndike Barnhart Advanced Junior Dictionary'', and the ''Thorndike Barnhart Junior Dictionary''. These dictionaries were abandoned in the first year of Scott Foresman's acquisition by Pearson Education in 1998.

'''Social Networking Pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] described by curriculum theorists [[Thomas Patrick Huston]] and [http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Hallie DeCatherine Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a form of learner-driven [[participatory culture]] where the user’s experience is reciprocal, consisting of a range of input and output experiences mediated by [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies.  The range of individual and unique differentiated user experiences form a composite impression on the individual which functions as an [[Epistemology|epistemic form]] of how we come to know and experience the world and its social, cultural, political and economic realities.     

In educational settings, social networking pedagogical approaches place [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies at their core, thus presenting expansive opportunities for education to extend the [[curriculum]] beyond the traditional walls of educational institutions by reaching into the daily-lived experiences of individuals. The [[Archive|archival]] features and lack of [[Temporality|temporal]] constraints associated with Internet technologies sustain continually changing currents that educators can connect to [[Student_voice|student-driven]] interests by engaging them with [[Trending_topic#Trends|trending topics]].  Through Social Network Pedagogy, educators can develop a teaching [[Praxis_(process)|praxis]] where the classroom and social space blend and individuals’ creative contributions are acknowledged for their cultural value.  

[http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Thomas_Patrick_Huston|Huston]] began theorizing the development of Social Networking Pedagogy during their tenure as doctoral students at the [[Indiana University School of Education]] where they were colleagues in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120507204235/http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?alias=education.indiana.edu%2Fedci Department of Curriculum and Instruction].

The '''Stanford Prison Experiment''' (SPE) was a 1971 [[social psychology]] experiment that attempted to investigate the [[Psychology|psychological]] effects of perceived power, focusing on the struggle between [[prisoner]]s and [[prison officer]]s. It was conducted at [[Stanford University]] between August 14–20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]] using college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/41|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment – A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment Conducted at Stanford University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, volunteers were randomly assigned to be either "guards" or "prisoners" in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the [[superintendent (jail)|superintendent]]. Several "prisoners" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days. Early reports on experimental results claimed that students quickly embraced their assigned roles, with some guards enforcing [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] measures and ultimately subjecting some prisoners to [[psychological torture]], while many prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, by the officers' request, actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it. The experiment has been described in many introductory social psychology textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2014/09/intro-psychology-textbooks-gloss-criticisms-zimbardos-stanford-prison-experiment-27970|title=Intro to psychology textbooks gloss over criticisms of Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment|date=September 7, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some are beginning to exclude it because its methodology is questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychology Itself Is Under Scrutiny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/health/psychology-studies-stanford-prison.html? |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain portions of it were filmed, and excerpts of footage are publicly available.

Some of the experiment's findings have been called into question, and the experiment has been criticized for unscientific methodology and possible fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment was massively influential. We just learned it was a fraud.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have noted that Zimbardo instructed the "guards" to exert psychological control over the "prisoners", and that some of the participants [[demand characteristics|behaved in a way that would help the study]], so that, as one "guard" later put it, "the researchers would have something to work with." Variants of the experiment have been performed by other researchers, but none of these attempts have replicated the results of the SPE.

== Zimbardo's goals==
The (archived) official website of the Stanford Prison Experiment describes the experiment goal as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We wanted to see what the psychological effects were of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. To do this, we decided to set up a simulated prison and then carefully note the effects of this institution on the behavior of all those within its walls.&lt;ref name="ArchivedOfficial"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1997 article from the Stanford News Service described experiment goals in a more detailed way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse ordinary individuals. "I had been conducting research for some years on deindividuation, vandalism and dehumanization that illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways that made them less than human, as enemies or objects," Zimbardo told the Toronto symposium in the summer of 1996.&lt;ref name="spespa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment: Still powerful after all these years (1/97)|date=1996-08-12|publisher=News.stanford.edu|accessdate=2018-07-12|quote=In the prison-conscious autumn of 1971, when George Jackson was killed at San Quentin and Attica erupted in even more deadly rebellion and retribution, the Stanford Prison Experiment made news in a big way. It offered the world a videotaped demonstration of how ordinary people, middle-class college students, can do things they would have never believed they were capable of doing. It seemed to say, as Hannah Arendt said of Adolf Eichmann, that normal people can take ghastly actions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Experimental method==
Male participants were recruited and told they would participate in a two-week prison simulation. The team selected the 24 applicants whose test results predicted they would be the most psychologically stable and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Smith, J. R.|editor2=Haslam, S. A.|date=2012|title= Social Psychology: Revisiting the Classic Studies |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; These participants were predominantly white&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Situationist Ethics|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2004/05/situationist_ethics.html|newspaper=Slate|date=May 12, 2004|access-date=February 2, 2016|issn=1091-2339|language=en-US|first=William|last=Saletan|author-link=William Saletan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="ArchivedOfficial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-4.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000512020449/http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-4.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 12, 2000|website=Prisonexp.org|page=Slide 4|title=Slideshow on official site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was intentionally selected to exclude those with criminal backgrounds, psychological impairments, or medical problems. They all agreed to participate in a 7- to 14-day period and received $15 per day (roughly equivalent to $94 per day in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;Haney, C.; Banks, W. C.; Zimbardo, P. G. (1973). "Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison". ''International Journal of Criminology and Penology''. 1: 69–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was conducted in a 35-foot (10.5 m) section of a basement of Jordan Hall (Stanford's psychology building). The prison had two fabricated walls, one at the entrance, and one at the cell wall to block observation. Each cell (6 × 9 feet, or 1.8 × 2.7 m), contained only a cot for the prisoners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, the guards lived in a very different environment, separated from the prisoners. They were given rest and relaxation areas, and other comforts.

Twelve of the 24 participants were assigned the role of prisoner (9 plus 3 potential substitutes), while the other 12 were assigned the role of guard (also 9 plus 3 potential substitutes). Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent and an undergraduate [[research assistant]] took on the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce [[disorientation]], [[depersonalization]], and [[deindividuation]] in the participants.

The researchers held an orientation session for the guards the day before the experiment, during which guards were instructed not to harm the prisoners physically or withhold food or drink. In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=760lwYmpXbc footage] of the study, Zimbardo can be seen talking to the guards: "You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy ... We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense of powerlessness. That is, in this situation we'll have all the power and they'll have none."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/msh/mh_teaching_site_files/a_lectures/C82SAD%20L07%20Social%20Influence%20II%20The%20BBC%20Prison%20Experiment%20(handout).doc|title=C82SAD L07 Social Influence II The BBC Prison Experiment (handout)|publisher=Psychology.nottingham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers provided the guards with wooden [[Club (weapon)|batons]] to establish their status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbardo.com/downloads/1973%20A%20Study%20of%20Prisoners%20and%20Guards,%20Naval%20Research%20Reviews.pdf |author=Haney, C. |author-link=Craig Haney |author2=Banks, W. C. |author3=Zimbardo, P. G. |last-author-amp=yes |date=1973|website=Zimbardo.com|title=Research reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; clothing similar to that of an actual prison guard (khaki shirt and pants from a local [[surplus store|military surplus store]]), and [[Mirrorshades (fashion)|mirrored sunglasses]] to prevent [[eye contact]]. Prisoners wore uncomfortable, ill-fitting smocks and stocking caps, as well as a chain around one ankle. Guards were instructed to call prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name.

The prisoners were "arrested" at their homes and "charged" with armed robbery. The local [[Palo Alto]] police department assisted Zimbardo with the arrests and conducted full booking procedures on the prisoners, which included [[fingerprint]]ing and taking [[mug shot]]s. The prisoners were transported to the mock prison from the police station, where they were [[strip search]]ed and given their new identities.

The small mock prison cells were set up to hold three prisoners each. There was a small corridor for the prison yard, a closet for solitary confinement, and a bigger room across from the prisoners for the guards and warden. The prisoners were to stay in their cells and the yard all day and night until the end of the study. The guards worked in teams of three for eight-hour shifts. The guards were not required to stay on site after their shift.

Guards had differing responses to their new roles. [https://stanfordprisonexperimentproject.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/and-another-blog-post/ Dave Eshelman], described by Stanford Magazine as "the most abusive guard" felt his aggressive behavior was helping experimenters to get what they wanted. John Mark, who had joined the experiment hoping to be selected as a prisoner, instead recalls "At that time of my life, I was getting high, all day every day... I brought joints with me, and every day I wanted to give them to the prisoners.  I looked at their faces and saw how they were getting dispirited and I felt sorry for them."&lt;ref name="Alum2011"/&gt; "Warden" David Jaffe intervened with Mark to get him to change his behavior, to "participate" more and become more "tough."&lt;ref name="Leadership"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Rethinking the 'nature' of brutality: Uncovering the role of identity leadership in the Stanford Prison Experiment. |last=Van Bavel |first=J.J. |journal= |quote=The transcript of the meeting between Jaffe and Mark provides striking evidence that the Warden encouraged the Guard to discard his personal identity, to adopt a collective identity, and to embody stereotypic expectations associated with that collective identity |date=July 12, 2018 |doi=10.31234/osf.io/b7crx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
After a relatively uneventful first day, on the second day the prisoners in Cell 1 blockaded their cell door with their beds and took off their stocking caps, refusing to come out or follow the guards' instructions. Guards from other shifts volunteered to work extra hours, to assist in subduing the revolt, and subsequently attacked the prisoners with [[fire extinguisher]]s without being supervised by the research staff. Finding that handling nine cell mates with only three guards per shift was challenging, one of the guards suggested they use psychological tactics to control them. They set up a "privilege cell" in which prisoners who were not involved in the riot were treated with special rewards, such as higher quality meals. The "privileged" inmates chose not to eat the meal in commiseration with their fellow prisoners.

After only 36 hours, one prisoner began to act "crazy", as Zimbardo described: "#8612 then began to act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control. It took quite a while before we became convinced that he was really suffering and that we had to release him." 
Guards forced the prisoners to repeat their assigned numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/11 |website=The Stanford Prison Experiment |title=Slide tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reinforce the idea that this was their new identity. Guards soon used these prisoner counts to harass the prisoners, using physical punishment such as protracted exercise for errors in the prisoner count. Sanitary conditions declined rapidly, exacerbated by the guards' refusal to allow some prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but in a bucket placed in their cell. As punishment, the guards would not let the prisoners empty the sanitation bucket. Mattresses were a valued item in the prison, so the guards would punish prisoners by removing their mattresses, leaving them to sleep on concrete. Some prisoners were forced to be naked as a method of degradation. Several guards became increasingly cruel as the experiment continued; experimenters reported that approximately one-third of the guards exhibited genuine sadistic tendencies. Most of the guards were upset when the experiment was halted after only six days.

Zimbardo mentions his own absorption in the experiment. On the fourth day, some of the guards stated they heard a rumor that the released prisoner was going to come back with his friends and free the remaining inmates. Zimbardo and the guards disassembled the prison and moved it onto a different floor of the building. Zimbardo himself waited in the basement, in case the released prisoner showed up, and planned to tell him that the experiment had been terminated. The released prisoner never returned, and the prison was rebuilt in the basement.

Zimbardo argued that the prisoners had [[internalization|internalized]] their roles, since some had stated they would accept "parole" even if it would mean forfeiting their pay, despite the fact that quitting would have achieved the same result without the delay involved in waiting for their parole requests to be granted or denied.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo, P.G. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zimbardo, P.G. |date=2007|title=The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil|location= New York|publisher= Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbardo argued they had no reason for continued participation in the experiment after having lost all monetary compensation, yet they did, because they had internalized the prisoner identity.

Prisoner No. 416, a newly admitted stand-by prisoner, expressed concern about the treatment of the other prisoners. The guards responded with more abuse. When he refused to eat his sausages, saying he was on a [[hunger strike]], guards confined him to "[[solitary confinement]]", a dark closet: "the guards then instructed the other prisoners to repeatedly punch on the door while shouting at 416."&lt;ref name = "Lucifer"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lucifereffect.com |title=The Lucifer Effect|website=lucifereffect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guards said he would be released from solitary confinement only if the prisoners gave up their blankets and slept on their bare mattresses, which all but one refused to do.

Zimbardo aborted the experiment early when [[Christina Maslach]], a graduate student in psychology whom he was dating (and later married),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html |website=Stanford University News Service |title= The Standard Prison Experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt; objected to the conditions of the prison after she was introduced to the experiment to conduct interviews. Zimbardo noted that, of more than 50 people who had observed the experiment, Maslach was the only one who questioned its morality. After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the experiment was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo, P.G. 2007"/&gt;

== Conclusions ==
On August 20, 1971, Zimbardo announced the end of the experiment to the participants.

According to Zimbardo's interpretation of the SPE, it demonstrated that the simulated-prison situation, rather than individual [[personality psychology|personality traits]], caused the participants' behavior. Using this [[Attribution theory|situational attribution]], the results are compatible with those of the [[Milgram experiment]], where random participants complied with orders to administer seemingly dangerous and potentially lethal [[electric shock]]s to a [[shill]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-real-lesson-of-the-stanford-prison-experiment |title=The Real Lesson of the Stanford Prison Experiment |last= Konnikova |first= Konnikova |work= New Yorker |quote=Occasionally, disputes between prisoner and guards got out of hand, violating an explicit injunction against physical force that both prisoners and guards had read prior to enrolling in the study. When the "superintendent" and "warden" overlooked these incidents, the message to the guards was clear: all is well; keep going as you are. The participants knew that an audience was watching, and so a lack of feedback could be read as tacit approval. And the sense of being watched may also have encouraged them to perform.  |date=June 12, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment has also been used to illustrate [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the power of [[authority]].

Participants' behavior may have been shaped by knowing that they were watched ([[Hawthorne effect]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zimbardo – Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|url = http://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|website = www.simplypsychology.org|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}|quote=Zimbardo (1973) was interested in finding out whether the brutality reported among guards in American prisons was due to the sadistic personalities of the guards (i.e., dispositional) or had more to do with the prison environment (i.e., situational).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being restrained by fear of an observer, guards may have behaved more aggressively when supervisors observing them did not step in to restrain them.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

Zimbardo instructed the guards before the experiment to disrespect the prisoners in various ways. For example, they had to refer to prisoners by number rather than by name. This, according to Zimbardo, was intended to diminish the prisoners' individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo (2007), ''The Lucifer Effect '', p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; With no control, prisoners learned they had little effect on what happened to them, ultimately causing them to stop responding, and give up.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Index of /downloads |url=http://www.zimbardo.com/downloads |website=www.zimbardo.com |accessdate=November 11, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120225935/http://www.zimbardo.com/downloads/ |archivedate=January 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quick to realize that the guards were the highest in the hierarchy, prisoners began to accept their roles as less important human beings.

One positive result of the study is that it has altered the way US prisons are run. For example, juveniles accused of federal crimes are no longer housed before trial with adult prisoners, due to the risk of violence against them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shortly after the study was completed, there were bloody revolts at both the [[San Quentin]] and [[Attica Prison riots|Attica]] prison facilities, and Zimbardo reported his findings on the experiment to the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]].

== Criticism and response ==
There has been controversy over both the ethics and scientific rigor of the Stanford prison experiment since nearly the beginning, and it has never been successfully replicated.&lt;ref name="lifespan of a lie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62|title=The Lifespan of a Lie – Trust Issues|last=Blum|first=Ben|website=Medium|access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; French academic and filmmaker Thibault Le Texier, in a 2018 book about the experiment, ''Histoire d'un mensonge'' ("Story of a lie"), wrote that it could not be meaningfully described as an experiment and that there were no real results to speak of.&lt;ref name="histoire"&gt;Thibault Le Texier, ''Histoire d'un mensonge. Enquête sur l'expérience de Stanford'', Paris: Zones, 2018, 296 p., {{ISBN|9782355221200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to criticism of his methodology, Zimbardo himself has agreed that the SPE was more of a "demonstration" than a scientific "experiment":

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the beginning, I have always said it's a demonstration. The only thing that makes it an experiment is the random assignment to prisoners and guards, that's the independent variable. There is no control group. There's no comparison group. So it doesn't fit the standards of what it means to be "an experiment." It's a very powerful demonstration of a psychological phenomenon, and it has had relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/28/17509470/stanford-prison-experiment-zimbardo-interview |title=Philip Zimbardo defends the Stanford Prison Experiment, his most famous work |last=Resnick |first=Brian |date=Jun 28, 2018 |website=Vox |access-date=2018-07-09}}|quote=From the beginning, I have always said it's a demonstration.

So it doesn't fit the standards of what it means to be "an experiment." It's a very powerful demonstration of a psychological phenomenon, and it has had relevance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2018, in response to criticism by Le Texier and other, Philip Zimbardo wrote a detailed rebuttal on his website. In his summary, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby assert that none of these criticisms present any substantial evidence that alters the SPE's main conclusion concerning the importance of understanding how systemic and situational forces can operate to influence individual behavior in negative or positive directions, often without our personal awareness. The SPE's core message is not that a psychological simulation of prison life is the same as the real thing, or that prisoners and guards always or even usually behave the way that they did in the SPE. Rather, the SPE serves as a cautionary tale of what might happen to any of us if we underestimate the extent to which the power of social roles and external pressures can influence our actions.&lt;ref name="zimbardo response"&gt;[http://www.prisonexp.org/response Philip Zimbardo’s Response To Recent Criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment], Stanford Prison Experiment website&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Treatment of "prisoners"===
Some of the guards' behavior allegedly led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. According to Zimbardo's report, one third of the guards were judged to have exhibited "genuine sadistic tendencies", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized, and five of them had to be removed from the experiment early. Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become deeply absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as deeply absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-31.htm |website=Stanford Prison Experiment |title= Conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a [[Milgram experiment|similar experiment]], conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at [[Yale University]] by [[Stanley Milgram]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt;

===Reliance on anecdotal evidence===
Because of the nature of the experiment, Zimbardo found it impossible to keep traditional [[scientific control]]s in place. He was unable to remain a [[Observation|neutral observer]], since he influenced the direction of the experiment as the prison's superintendent. Conclusions and observations drawn by the experimenters were largely [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]], and the experiment is practically impossible for other researchers to accurately [[reproducibility|reproduce]]. [[Erich Fromm]] claimed to see generalizations in the experiment's results and argued that the personality of an individual does affect behavior when imprisoned. This ran counter to the study's conclusion that the prison situation itself controls the individual's behavior. Fromm also argued that the amount of sadism in the "normal" subjects could not be determined with the methods employed to screen them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ahrp.org/1971-stanford-prison-experiment-conducted-by-philip-zimbardo-was-an-exercise-that-unleashed-unprovoked-violence-and-a-predilection-for-abuse-bordering-on-torture/|title=1971: Philip Zimbardo, Stanford Prison Experiment - precursor for Abu Ghraib torture. - AHRP|date=December 28, 2014|work=AHRP|access-date=March 31, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griggs|first=Richard A.|date=July 13, 2014|title=Coverage of the Stanford Prison Experiment in Introductory Psychology Textbooks|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628314537968|journal=Teaching of Psychology|volume=41|pages=195–203|via=SAGE Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fromm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/frozim.html|title=Fromm...on Zimbardo's Prison Experiment|website=www.angelfire.com|access-date=March 31, 2018|quote=The purpose of the experiment was to study the behavior of normal people under a particular situation, that of playing the roles of prisoners and guards respectively, in a "mock prison." The general thesis that the authors believe is proved by the experiment is that many, perhaps the majority of people, can be made to do almost anything by the strength of the situation they are put in, regardless of their morals, personal convictions, and values (P. H. G. Zimbardo, 1972)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaching of "guards"===
Carlo Prescott, who was Zimbardo's "prison consultant" during the experiment by virtue of having served 17 years in San Quentin for attempted murder, spoke out against the experiment publicly in a 2005 article he contributed to the ''Stanford Daily'', after he had read about the various ways in which Zimbardo and others used the experiment to explain atrocities that had taken place in real prisons. In that article, entitled "The Lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford20050428-01.2.24&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------|title=The Stanford Daily 28 April 2005 — The Stanford Daily|website=stanforddailyarchive.com|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] ideas such as bags being placed over the heads of prisoners, inmates being bound together with chains and buckets being used in place of toilets in their cells were all experiences of mine at the old "Spanish Jail" section of San Quentin and which I dutifully shared with the Stanford Prison Experiment braintrust months before the experiment started. To allege that all these carefully tested, psychologically solid, upper-middle-class Caucasian "guards" dreamed this up on their own is absurd. How can Zimbardo and, by proxy, Maverick Entertainment express horror at the behavior of the "guards" when they were merely doing what Zimbardo and others, myself included, encouraged them to do at the outset or frankly established as ground rules?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like Zimbardo, Prescott has spoken before Congress on issues of prison reform.

(Zimbardo, in his 2018 response, wrote that, though Prescott attached his name to the article, it was in fact written by Hollywood writer/producer [[Michael Lazarou]], who had unsuccessfully tried to get film rights to the Stanford prison experiment story, and when he was turned down began to publicly criticize it.&lt;ref name="zimbardo response" /&gt;)

In 2018, digitized recordings available on the official SPE website were widely discussed, particularly one where "prison warden" David Jaffe tried to influence the behavior of one of the "guards" by encouraging him to "participate" more and be more "tough" for the benefit of the experiment.&lt;ref name="Cosmos2018"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/social-sciences/new-evidence-shows-stanford-prison-experiment-conclusions-untenable |title=New evidence shows Stanford Prison Experiment conclusions "untenable" |last= Masterson |first= Andrew |work=Cosmos |quote=Archival recordings show one of the world's most famous psychology experiments was poorly designed – and its use to justify brutality baseless. |date=July 9, 2018 |accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leadership"/&gt;
In his 2018 response, Zimbardo wrote that the instructions they gave to the guards were "mild compared to the pressure exerted by actual wardens and superior officers in real-life prison and military settings, where guards failing to participate fully can face disciplinary hearings, demotion, or dismissal."&lt;ref name="zimbardo response" /&gt;

===Implied demands by Zimbardo===
The study was criticized in 2013 for [[demand characteristics]] by psychologist Peter Gray, who argued that participants in psychological experiments are more likely to do what they believe the researchers want them to do, and specifically in the case of the Stanford prison experiment, "to act out their stereotyped views of what prisoners and guards do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gray, Peter |date=2013|work=Freedom to Learn blog |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201310/why-zimbardo-s-prison-experiment-isn-t-in-my-textbook |title=Why Zimbardo's Prison Experiment Isn't in My Textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray stated that he did not include the experiment in his introductory textbook, ''Psychology'', because he thought it lacked scientific rigor.

"John Wayne" (the real-life Dave Eshelman), one of the guards in the experiment, said that he caused the escalation of events between guards and prisoners after he began to emulate a character from the 1967 film ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]''. He further intensified his actions because he was nicknamed "[[John Wayne]]" by the other participants, even though he was trying to mimic actor [[Strother Martin]], who had played the role of the sadistic prison Captain in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='John Wayne' (name withheld) Interview: 'The Science of Evil'|work= Primetime: Basic Instincts|publisher= KATU|date= January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he described it:

&lt;blockquote&gt; What came over me was not an accident. It was planned. I set out with a definite plan in mind, to try to force the action, force something to happen, so that the researchers would have something to work with. After all, what could they possibly learn from guys sitting around like it was a country club? So I consciously created this persona. I was in all kinds of drama productions in high school and college. It was something I was very familiar with: to take on another personality before you step out on the stage. I was kind of running my own experiment in there, by saying, "How far can I push these things and how much abuse will these people take before they say, 'knock it off?'" But the other guards didn't stop me. They seemed to join in. They were taking my lead. Not a single guard said, "I don't think we should do this."&lt;ref name="Alum2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=40741 |title=The Menace Within |last=Ratnasar |first=Romesh |work=Stanford Alumni Magazine |quote=In 1973, an investigation by the American Psychological Association concluded that the prison study had satisfied the profession's existing ethical standards. But in subsequent years, those guidelines were revised to prohibit human-subject simulations modeled on the SPE. "No behavioral research that puts people in that kind of setting can ever be done again in America," Zimbardo says. |date=2011 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 2018 rebuttal, Zimbardo wrote that Eshelman's actions went "far beyond simply playing the role of a tough guard", and that his and the other guards' acts, given "their striking parallels with real-world prison atrocities", "tell us something important about human nature".&lt;ref name="zimbardo response" /&gt;

===Reporting and interpretation of outcome===
Two students from the "prisoners" group left the experiment before it was terminated on the sixth day. Douglas Korpi was the first to leave, after 36 hours; he had a seeming mental breakdown in which he yelled "Jesus Christ, I'm burning up inside!" and "I can't stand another night! I just can't take it anymore!" His outburst was captured by a camera, and has become, in one commentator's words, "a defining moment" of the study.&lt;ref name="lifespan of a lie" /&gt; In a 2017 interview, Korpi stated that his breakdown had been fake, and that he did it only so that he could leave and return to studying. (He had originally thought that he could study while "imprisoned", but the "prison staff" would not allow him.)&lt;ref name="lifespan of a lie" /&gt; Zimbardo later stated that participants only had to state the phrase "I quit the experiment" in order to leave,&lt;ref name="lifespan of a lie" /&gt; but transcripts from a taped conversation between Zimbardo and his staff show him stating "There are only two conditions under which you can leave, medical help or psychiatric."&lt;ref name="histoire" /&gt; In the 2017 interview, Korpi expressed regret that he had not filed a [[false imprisonment]] charge at the time.&lt;ref name="lifespan of a lie" /&gt;

In his 2018 rebuttal, Zimbardo noted that Korpi's description of his actions had changed several times before the 2017 interview, and that in Zimbardo's 1992 documentary ''Quiet Rage'' Korpi had stated that the experiment "was the most upsetting experience of his life".&lt;ref name="zimbardo response" /&gt;

===Small and unrepresentative sample===
Critics contend that not only was the sample size too small for extrapolation, but also having all of the experimental subjects be US male students gravely undercut the experiment's validity. In other words, it is conceivable that replicating the experiment using a diverse group of people (with different objectives and views in life)&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; would have produced radically distinct results; that is, had the test subjects come from divergent socio-economic and psychological groups, different experimental results may well have resulted.

Researchers from [[Western Kentucky University]] argued that [[selection bias]] may have played a role in the results. The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying "a psychological study" (the control group), and some with the words "prison life" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the "prison study" were higher in traits such as [[social dominance theory|social dominance]], [[aggression]], [[authoritarianism]], etc. and were lower in traits related to [[empathy]] and [[altruism]] when compared to the control group participants.&lt;ref name=revisitingSFE&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Thomas | last = Carnahan |author2=Sam McFarland | year = 2007 | title = Revisiting the Stanford prison experiment: could participant self-selection have led to the cruelty? | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–14 | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~bertsch/Carnahan.pdf | doi=10.1177/0146167206292689 | pmid=17440210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical issues ==
The experiment was perceived by many to involve questionable ethics, the most serious concern being that it was continued even after participants expressed their desire to withdraw. Despite the fact that participants were told they had the right to leave at any time, Zimbardo did not allow this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since the time of the Stanford experiment, ethical guidelines have been established for [[Guidelines for human subject research|experiments involving human subjects]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Belmont Report, Office of the Secretary, Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects for Biomedical and Behavioral Research, April 18, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Nuremberg Code&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford Prison Experiment led to the implementation of rules to preclude any harmful treatment of participants. Before they are implemented, human studies must now be reviewed and found by an [[institutional review board]] (US) or ethics committee (UK) to be in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These guidelines involve the consideration of whether the potential benefit to science outweighs the possible risk for physical and psychological harm.

A post-experimental debriefing is now considered an important ethical consideration to ensure that participants are not harmed in any way by their experience in an experiment. Though Zimbardo did conduct debriefing sessions, they were several years after the Stanford Prison Experiment. By that time numerous details were forgotten; nonetheless, many participants reported that they experienced no lasting negative effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Current standards specify that the debriefing process should occur as soon as possible to assess what psychological harm, if any, may have been done and to rehabilitate participants, if necessary. If there is an unavoidable delay in debriefing, the researcher is obligated to take steps to minimize harm.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (2017). Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, Sec. 8.07. http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons to Abu Ghraib ==
When [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq]] were publicized in March 2004, Zimbardo himself, who paid close attention to the details of the story, was struck by the similarity with his own experiment. He was dismayed by official military and government representatives' shifting the blame for the torture and abuses in the [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] American military prison onto "a few bad apples" rather than acknowledging the possibly systemic problems of a formally established military incarceration system.

Eventually, Zimbardo became involved with the defense team of lawyers representing one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards, Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick|Ivan "Chip" Frederick]]. He was granted full access to all investigation and background reports, and testified as an [[expert witness]] in SSG Frederick's [[court martial]], which resulted in an eight-year prison sentence for Frederick in October 2004.

Zimbardo drew from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil,'' published by [[Random House]] in 2007, which deals with the similarities between his own Stanford Prison Experiment and the Abu Ghraib abuses.&lt;ref name = "Lucifer"/&gt;

=== BBC prison study ===
Psychologists [[Alex Haslam]] and [[Steve Reicher]] conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2002 and published the results in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcprisonstudy.org|title=Welcome to the official site for the BBC Prison Study. Home - The BBC Prison Study|website=www.bbcprisonstudy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a partial replication of the Stanford prison experiment conducted with the assistance of the [[BBC]], which broadcast events in the study in a documentary series called ''[[The Experiment]]''. Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, [[stress (biology)|stress]], and leadership. The results were published in leading academic journals such as ''[[British Journal of Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'', ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]''. The BBC Prison Study is now taught as a core study on the UK [[A-level]] [[Psychology]] OCR syllabus.

While Haslam and Reicher's procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo's, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,1605313,00.html Interview of Alex Haslam] at ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Reicher|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Reicher|last2=Haslam|first2=Alex|authorlink2=Alex Haslam|interviewer = Briggs, Pam |title=''Learning from the Experiment''|work=The Psychologist|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221194634/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm| archivedate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments in the United States===
The Stanford prison experiment was in part a response to the [[Milgram experiment]] at Yale beginning in 1961 and published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html|title=Milgram Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave experiment]] involved the use of authoritarian dynamics similar to [[Nazi Party]] methods of mass control in a classroom setting by high school teacher [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], in 1967 with the goal of demonstrating to the class in a vivid way how the German public in [[World War II]] could have acted in the way it did.&lt;ref name="wave"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewavehome.com/1976_The-Third-Wave_story.htm |title=The Third Wave
 |last1=Jones |first1=Ron |date=1976 |website=The Wave Home |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202082041/http://www.thewavehome.com/1976_The-Third-Wave_story.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2015 |accessdate=December 3, 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of Jones' accounts has been questioned, several participants in the study have gone on record to confirm the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lessonplanmovie.com/|title=Lesson Plan: The Story of the Third Wave (The Wave, Die Welle)|website=www.lessonplanmovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both experiments, participants found it difficult to leave the study due to the roles they were assigned. Both studies examine human nature and the effects of authority. Personalities of the subjects had little influence on both experiments despite the test prior to the prison experiment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Comparing Milgram's Obedience and Zimbardo's Prison Studies|url = http://sccpsy101.com/2011/11/25/comparing-milgrams-obedience-and-zimbardos-prison-studies/|website = PSY 101 – Introduction to Psychology by Jeffrey Ricker, Ph.D.|accessdate = November 12, 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Milgram and the Zimbardo studies, participants conform to social pressures. Conformity is strengthened by allowing some participants to feel more or less powerful than others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In both experiments, behavior is altered to match the group stereotype.

'''''The Social Seminar''''' is a series of educational films for adults produced by the Extension Media Center of the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] in the early 1970s.  The series was executive produced by [[Gary Schlosser]], an Oscar-nominated producer of short-subject documentaries.  The films were distributed nationally, for example to state educational film offices.  The series was produced for the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] as a "multi-media training series."

Five episodes of ''The Social Seminar'' are known to have been produced: "Bunny," "Guy," "Teddy," "Tom," and "Changing."  Each depicted, in a [[cinema-verite]] style without voiceover or introduction, aspects of the lives of a selected person or family as they dealt with personal, interpersonal and societal change.  The episode "Changing," for example, showed how one man's reevaluation of his life and social standing led to his becoming a "hippie" in the eyes of his family and coworkers; though his home life was enhanced, he found himself increasingly socially isolated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/SocialSe1971 "Social Seminar: Changing (1971)"] Prelinger Archives, archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The films are now part of the [[Prelinger Archive]] and are available freely online. In June 2011, "Changing" was featured on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] series ''[[TCM Underground]]''.

==In popular culture==
* Electronic music duo [[Boards of Canada]] sampled dialogue from the "Tom" episode of ''The Social Seminar'' in their song "Chromakey Dreamcoat", from the album ''[[The Campfire Headphase]]''.
* British rock band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] sampled dialogue from the "Changing" episode of ''The Social Seminar'' in their song "Fake It", from the album ''[[Wild World (album)|Wild World]]''.

The '''University of Agriculture''' (''UAF'') is a [[public university|public]] [[Research universities|research university]] in [[Faisalabad]], Pakistan. It is ranked 4th in Pakistan and 1st in the field of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences by HEC Ranking 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= UAF Ranks No 1 in Agriculture Category |url= http://hec.gov.pk/english/services/universities/Ranking/2010/Pages/Category-Wise-Rankings.aspx |website= hec.gov.pk |accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also ranked among top 800 world universities by [[QS World University Rankings]] in 2015,2017. The employability ranking by Pakistan made this institution highly reputable. The university came among top 5 institutions of Pakistan in research power.

== History ==
===Origins===
The University of Agriculture, Faisalabad ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جامعہ زرعيه فيصل آباد}}}}), (formally: ''Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute''), is a [[university]] in the city of [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It was established in 1906&lt;ref name=uaf&gt;http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].

At independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.

The 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.

UAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] 

The university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 5,000 students and approximately 3,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Haley Hall]].

====Faculty of Social Sciences====

The Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, established in 1963, with its constituent departments of Agricultural Economics, Farm Management, Agricultural Marketing, Cooperation and Credit and Rural Sociology, has now been functioning for over 51 years in the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. It has endeavored to keep abreast with requirements in terms of academic programmes/activities over these years. However, looking at the likely shape of agricultural development, the direction and quality of research and the make-up of trained manpower output in the discipline of agricultural social sciences, the future trends need to be looked into seriously so as to be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

A perusal of the functioning of the constituent departments of the faculty showed that over the years the programmes of some of the departments had become less demanding in academic and research output in line with the present day requirements. Especially under WTO set up, where there has been a shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture putting further pressure to shift the emphasis to resource management strategy. Therefore, there was a strong need for a meaningful restructuring and fine tuning of the faculty to meet the challenges of the emerging requirements of the economy in the coming years.

Keeping in view this need of time, the Faculty was restructured in 2012. The name of faculty was changed to Faculty of Social Sciences. The departments of Agricultural Economics, Development Economics, and Environmental &amp; Resource Economics were merged into a new institute, Institute of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (IARE). Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq is the first director of IARE, having served from June 2012.

Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics now offers degree programs serving the needs of society:
* BSc (Hons) Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (4 years)
* MSc (Hons) Agricultural Economics (2 years)
* MSc (Hons) Development Economics (2 years)
* MSc (Hons) Environmental &amp; Resource Economics (2 years)
* MSc Economics (Distance Learning Program) (2 years)
* M.Phil Economics (2 years)
* PhD Agricultural Economics
* PhD Environmental &amp; Resource Economics
* PhD Economics

The Faculty of Social Sciences is divided in following institutes:

* Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics
* Institute of Business Management Sciences (offers programs at undergraduate and postgraduate level)
* Institute of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development (offers programs at undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral level)
* Department of Rural Sociology (offers programs at postgraduate level as well as PhD program)

Professor Dr Muhammad Iqbal Zafar is dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences.&lt;ref name=uaf/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3780">'''Vivian Trow Thayer''' (1886–1979) is best known as a Progressive educator who authored many books about [[American education]]. He was married to Florence Amelia Adams. 

Thayer was born in Nebraska and raised in rural Wisconsin. Thayer's father worked as a minister, rural mail-carrier, and farmer. The economic challenges of Thayer's early life impacted his sensitivity to the struggle of others later in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Kridel, Craig and Robert V. Bullough, Jr. ''Stories of the Eight-Year Study: Reexamining Secondary Education in America''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Carroll University|Carroll Academy]], and then moved to the [[University of Wisconsin at Madison]], where he received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in philosophy. While pursuing his degrees, Thayer worked to support himself through employment first as an attendant at a sanitarium, then in a restaurant, and later waiting tables in a boarding house. At one point, financial constraints forced him to take a two-year leave from the university and serve first as principal of an elementary school, and later as Superintendent of Schools, in [[Ashland, Wisconsin]].

During his tenure as Educational Director of the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture Schools]] in New York City from 1928–1948, Thayer was involved with the [[Progressive Education Association]]. His role and work in the [[Eight-Year Study]] led to the formation of a second commission which he chaired: the Commission on the Secondary School Curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Cremin, Lawrence A. ''[[The Transformation of the School: Progressivism in American Education, 1876–1957]]''. New York: Random House, 1964. p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the commission were published in ''Reorganizing Secondary Education'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;Zepper, John T. "V. T. Thayer: Progressive Educator." The Educational Forum May (1970): 495–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thayer is associated with the educational philosophy of [[John Dewey]], and worked with many leading Progressive educators. Among others were [[Boyd H. Bode]], [[Horace Kallen]], and [[Harold Alberty]]. Thayer lectured and taught at many universities, including Teacher's College, Columbia University; Harvard University; Ohio State University; the University of Hawaii; the University of Virginia; and Johns Hopkins University.

In 1933, Thayer was one of the original signories of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' (I). He served in editorial positions for the ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|American Review]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Educational Research]]''. Thayer was named a [[Kappa Delta Pi]] Laureate, Pioneer Humanist of the Year (1964) by the [[American Humanist Association]], and in 1969 received the Distinguished Lifetime Service to Education award from [[John Dewey Society|The John Dewey Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Linda L. G. ''Explore the Laureate Legacy: Vivian Trow Thayer 1957''. http://www.kdp.org/meetourlaureates/laureates/vivianthayer.php&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''online school''' ('''virtual school''' or '''e-school''' or '''cyber-school''') teaches students entirely or primarily online or through the internet. It has been defined as "education that uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Elaine|date=May 2017|title=Distance Education Enrollment Report 2017|url=https://onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/digtiallearningcompassenrollment2017.pdf|journal=Digital Learning Compass|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Online education exists all around the world and is used for all levels of education (K-12, college, or graduate school). This type of learning enables the individuals to earn transferable credits, take recognized examinations, or advance to the next level of education over the internet.
[[File:Number_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Courses_by_Level_(2012-2015).png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Number_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Courses_by_Level_(2012-2015).png|thumb|Number of Students Taking Distance Courses  by Level (2012-2015)&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;]]
Virtual education is most commonly used at the high school or college level. Students who are of the age 30 or older, tend to study on online programs at higher rates. This group represents 41% of the online education population, while 35.5% of students ages 24-29 and 24.5% of students ages 15-23 participate in virtual education.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlineschoolscenter.com/25-surprising-facts-online-education/|title=25 Surprising Or Little Known Facts About Online Education|date=2017-10-21|work=Online Schools Center|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Percentage_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Course_(2012-2015).png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Percentage_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Course_(2012-2015).png|alt=|thumb|Percentage of Students Taking Distance Courses (2012-2015)&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;]]
Virtual education is becoming increasing used worldwide. There are currently more than 4,700 colleges and universities that provide online courses to their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/online-education/articles/2018-01-11/study-more-students-are-enrolling-in-online-courses|title=Studey: More Students are Enrolling in Online Courses|last=Friedman|first=Jordan|date=January 11, 2018|website=U.S News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, more than 6 million students were taking at least one course online, this number grew by 3.9% from the previous year. 29.7% of all higher education students are taking at least one distance course. The total number of students studying on a campus exclusively dropped by 931,317 people between the years 2012 and 2015.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Experts say that because the number of students studying at the college level is growing, there will also be an increase in the number of students enrolled in distance learning. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Instructional models==
Instructional models vary, ranging from distance learning types which provide study materials for independent self-paced study, to live, interactive classes where students communicate with a teacher in a class group lesson. Class sizes range widely from a small group of 6 pupils or students to hundreds in a virtual school.

The courses that are independent and self paced are called asynchronous courses. Typically for this type of learning, the students are given the assignments and information, and are expected to complete the assignments by the due date. This is done on their own time. There is no scheduled time when the class meets. Usually the only interactions that takes place are through discussion boards, blogs, and wikis.

On the other hand, synchronous online courses happen in real time. The instructor and students all interact online at the same time. This is done either through text, video, or audio chat. Therefore these lessons are socially constructed. In addition to the scheduled class time, there is usually additional assignments to complete.  

Hybrid, sometimes also called blended, courses are when students learn and interact both in person and online. Theses classes meet in person during the semester in addition to computer based communication. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/24884/online_learning/7897/types_of_online_learning/1|title=Types of Online Learning|last=D.|first=Potts Zachary|website=www.fordham.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mid-1990s&lt;ref name="reality"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The reality of virtual schools: A Review of the literature|journal=Computers &amp; Education|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2008.09.009|volume=52|issue=2 |date=February 2009|pages=402–416|author1=Barbour, Michael K.|author2=Reeves, Thomas C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the advent of completely virtual schools. Many of today's virtual schools are descendants of correspondence schools. The earlier online schools began in Australia, New Zealand, North America and the UK, generally in areas where low density population made schooling by conventional means difficult and expensive to provide.&lt;ref name="reality" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ICT Assisted Project Based Learning: eLearning in Aviation|url = http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.4472.3043|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.4472.3043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 an assessment found high dropout rates.&lt;ref name="predicting"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter114/roblyer114.html, |title=Predicting Success for Virtual School Students: Putting Research-based Models into Practice|year=2008|author=M. D. Roblyer|author2=Lloyd Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other computerized environments, once the glamour of the new methods wore off it became clear that human skills were paramount to success, in this case teaching and welfare expertise. Where this is recognized retention is good, i.e. in the synchronous, socially structured models; in the huge MOOC style courses the same isolation problems as correspondence learning are found.

Sometimes referred to as "[[distance education|distance learning]]", correspondence schools offered students an alternative to the traditional brick and mortar meetings within a schoolhouse. These schools utilized the postal service for student-teacher interaction, or used two-way radio transmissions, sometimes with pre-recorded television broadcasts. Students were expected to study their learning material independently and, in some cases, meet with a proctor to be tested.

Virtual schools now exist all around the world.  Over the past decade, [[K-12]] online instruction has dramatically increased in both Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning in a Virtual World for Real Life|url = http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.5029.3602|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.5029.3602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these virtual schools have been integrated into public schools (particularly in the United States), where students sit in computer labs and do their work online. Students can also be completely [[home-schooled]], or they can take any combination of public/private/home-schooling and online classes.

The International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL) developed a set of standards released in September 2007 and updated on October 12, 2011. These standards will help monitor online programs and ensure that every provider of education is accredited. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wicks|first=Matthew|date=October 2010|title=A National Primer on K-12 Online Learning|url=http://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iNCL_NationalPrimerv22010-web1.pdf|journal=iNACOL|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pricing and location==
Where online methods are integrated with State provision, costs follow state school standards. Otherwise fees must be met by the student, or parents. Many US [[school district]]s are now creating their own online services  to avoid paying external providers. Such students can graduate from their home district without ever leaving home.  In most of these cases, students are given computers, books, and even internet service to complete coursework from home.

With the resources of the internet as a [[library]], and the ease of making online study materials, there is usually a comparatively small requirement for [[textbook]]s. Most courses will provide electronic materials free of cost, or included in the course fee. Textbooks are most often required for an exam syllabus course.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Advocates of online schools and online learning point to a number of advantages:

* There is a lack of costly and tiring travel involved, with a much greater dependability of lessons. Weather disrupting transport is almost irrelevant (though an area subject to frequent power cuts will suffer consequent disruptions). Similarly common health disruptions through minor illness or injury will not halt learning, because the physical demands are so much less. Transcripts of lessons can plug short absences.
* Many students who have personal or health conditions that make physical school difficult or impossible can instead learn using virtual educational programs. 
* Ideal for individuals and families who need flexible arrangements. However, synchronous learning does impose limits due to timezones, which tends to divide online schools in Europe and Asia from North America.
* The integration of internet resources provides a huge library of content, and students quickly become adept at online research. 
* There is a greater flexibility for [[Autodidacticism|self-learners]] or [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students to explore learning beyond the standard curriculum. Independent minded students, those with specialist skills and ambitions, can develop at their own preferred pacing using net resources.
* Online schools can be equalizers, as age, appearance, and background are far less obvious. Groups can be categorized by personal ability.
* Students and pupils benefit from exposure to others in different cultures of the world, which enriches understanding of history, geography, religions and politics, and develops social skills.
* Part-time students with jobs or family commitments may benefit from the flexibility of online schedules, as claimed by supporters of virtual education.
* For asynchronous education, a student may study, learn, or do their homework when they have free time. Therefore, this gives the students flexibility with their education. 
* It is argued that online learning is more effective and efficient at providing education to a large number of people no matter the physical distance between the students and professors than traditional education. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsasi|first=Meirani|date=|title=A Study of a Distance Education Institution|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1165872.pdf|journal=Determinants of Student Satisfaction in Online Tutorial|volume=19|pages=89 - 99|via=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are claims that online education "develops higher order skills such as collaborating across time and place and solving complex real-world problems" better than in-class learning. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Students have the ability to avoid the requirement of traveling to a physical school.
* As pointed out by advocates of online schooling, this type of education could be beneficial in rural areas, where the distance between students and educators is vast. 
*A student may have the ability to take a course that is not offered at a location near them. 
* Some affirm that virtual education is very cost effective for schools or districts because it allows a teacher to instruct more students than in a face-to-face classroom setting. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-should-take-online-courses/|title=Online schooling: Who is harmed and who is helped?|last=Dynarski|first=Susan M.|date=2017-10-26|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It has been claimed that courses online are less expensive for the students than course taken in traditional school, college, or university. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ies.ncsu.edu/resources/white-papers/pros-and-cons-of-online-education/|title=Pros and Cons of Online Education {{!}} NC State Industry Expansion Solutions|website=NC State Industry Expansion Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some disadvantages of virtual school includes:

* Critics argue that students do not interact with their instructors or peers face-to-face, which lends itself to a "lack of socialization" unless supplemented using online groups such as Elluminate or Wimba, or by attending other social activities outside of school.
* A challenge pointed out by critics is that there is an added challenge of staying focused while in the home environment. It has been reported that many students have a difficult time staying on task when participating in learning online. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* Some argue that the cost of starting up an online school is expensive.
* As pointed out by opposers of online school, not everyone has access to digital technologies which would prohibited them to attend virtual schools, unless their local libraries or community programs may offer access to computers and research materials.
* An argument identified by critics is that virtual schools are relatively new and because of that there are no seldom methods of evaluating their effectiveness in educating their students.
* As claimed in a study done by Eric Bettinger and Susanna Loeb, on average, online students "do substantially worse than students in the same face-to-face course".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
*Critics have pointed out that it is common for technology to be unpredictable, glitch, or not function correctly. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Some people who oppose virtual education have argued that obtaining a job with an online degree may be harder because potential employers may be skeptical of the credibility of these virtual programs. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The assignments due for online schooling may not be assessing the ability of the students because many answers can be found on the internet, as claimed by critics of online schooling. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Vision span''' or '''perceptual span''' is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which  the [[human eye]] has sharp enough [[Visual perception|vision]] to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The [[visual field]] of the human eye spans approximately 120&amp;nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]].  However, most of that arc is [[peripheral vision]]. The human eye has much greater [[Optical resolution|resolution]] in the [[macula]], where there is a higher density of [[cone cell]]s. The [[field of view]] that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6&amp;nbsp;degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50&amp;nbsp;centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the [[field of view]] with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face.&lt;ref name=FS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/17.5.16 |pmid=28549354 |title=The Facespan—the perceptual span for face recognition |journal=Journal of Vision |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=16 |year=2017 |last1=Papinutto |first1=Michael |last2=Lao |first2=Junpeng |last3=Ramon |first3=Meike |last4=Caldara |first4=Roberto |last5=Miellet |first5=Sébastien }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.

==Application to speed reading==

While reading, readers will fail to recognize a word unless they are fixating within three to four character spaces of the word.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90005-5 |title=The perceptual span and peripheral cues in reading |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=65–81 |year=1975 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for [[speed reading|speed readers]] and [[Skimming (reading)|skimmers]].  Speed readers cannot answer questions about a main point or detail, if they did not fixate directly on it or within three character spaces of it (Just and Carpenter 1987).  When a text is removed whilst reading, readers can only accurately report upon the word they were fixating upon or the next one to the right (McConkie and Hogaoam 1985).  There is no evidence from eye movement research that individuals are making predictions of text based upon hypotheses about the words in the periphery so that they can skip over or spend less time on unimportant or redundant words.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975/&gt;

Most speed reading courses claim that the peripheral vision can be used to read text. This has been suggested impossible because the text is blurred out through lack of visual resolution.  At best the human brain can only ''guess'' at the content of text outside the macular region. There simply are not enough cone cells away from the center of the visual field to identify words in the periphery of the field.

It has been suggested that the fixation span can be stretched through training ([[meta guiding]]) to take in as much as a line for the purpose of skimming or speed reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 2729064|year = 2007|last1 = Legge|first1 = G. E|title = The case for the visual span as a sensory bottleneck in reading|journal = Journal of Vision|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 9.1–915|last2 = Cheung|first2 = S. H|last3 = Yu|first3 = D|last4 = Chung|first4 = S. T|last5 = Lee|first5 = H. W|last6 = Owens|first6 = D. P|pmid = 18217824|doi = 10.1167/7.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However other sources suggest that using this method can result in a severely reduced comprehension rate in comparison to normal reading ("[[rauding]]").

Some speed reading courses stress that the human eye has to move very quickly.  They also stress that the human eye should move in a pattern to fill in the information that was not properly perceived.  The effective limit for [[wikt:scan|scan]]ning speeds based upon the limit of the human eye's resolution is about 300 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;http://skepdic.com/speedreading.html{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that such speeds also require great practice, and extremely rapid eye movements, although research suggests that such training is not possible.  It has been suggested by some speed reading promoters that the readers who achieve such speeds are on the [[autism spectrum]].  Research into reading rate suggests that study strategies, rather than speed reading, explains why expert readers, such as professors and editors, are more efficient than others.

==Application to face processing==

Face recognition system requires several fixation on different location (typically in a triangular pattern) for a face to be recognised. The same is true for the so-called Super Recognisers who are persons with high face recognition capabilities. Similarly to the reading span, the Facespan might be modulated by difficulty,&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1990-18858-001{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; expertise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/PBR.17.6.834 |pmid=21169577 |title=Eye movements, the perceptual span, and reading speed |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=834 |year=2010 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |last2=Slattery |first2=Timothy J |last3=Bélanger |first3=Nathalie N |pmc=3075059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(86)90037-8 |pmid=3701249 |title=Eye movements and the perceptual span in beginning and skilled readers |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=211–36 |year=1986 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648003 |title=Eye movements, perceptual span, and reading disability |journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=33 |pages=163–173 |year=1983 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other idiosyncratic differences between individuals. The idiosyncratic differences are thus most probably due to differences in Facespan rather than in oculomotor strategy. Previous study revealed that the Vision span is more accurately defined in number of characters rather than in visual angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02364.x |pmid=19470124 |title=Parafoveal Magnification |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=721–8 |year=2009 |last1=Miellet |first1=Sébastien |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Patrick J |last3=Sereno |first3=Sara C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
