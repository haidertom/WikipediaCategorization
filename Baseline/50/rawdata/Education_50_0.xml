The '''Age of Interruption''' refers to a seeming increase in fractured attention due to media tools and virtual [[multitasking]]. The term was popularized by [[Thomas Friedman]] in a 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' opinion editorial.

== Origin of term ==
Friedman deemed the age of "malady of modernity", and characterized it as reflecting [[information overload]] and lack of adequate attention span:

"Continuous partial attention is when you are on the Internet or cellphone or BlackBerry while also watching TV, typing on your computer and answering a question from your kid. That is, you are multitasking your way through the day, continuously devoting only partial attention to each act or person you encounter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The Age of Interruption|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/opinion/05friedman.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and education ==
Characterized by information overload and multitasking, the age of interruption is a relatively recent but still frequently studied topic in education and technology disciplines. Educators and technology researchers study the phenomenon in relation to its effects on social, cognitive and emotional development. Ellen Rose, a professor of education at [[University of New Brunswick]] in [[Canada]], studies online learning environments, with particular expertise in social effects of technology and [[media ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work of Ellen Rose| url=https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/education/people/ellenrose.html|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 academic article, she posits that the Age of Interruption is another age in technological formation, following the Information Age. She discusses the Age of Interruption in relation to younger generations ([[digital native]]s) who have an over-abundance of information along with a general attitude of inattention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bassendowski |first=Sandra |title=The Age of Interruption |url=http://cjni.ca/journal/?p=1897 |journal=Canadian Journal of Nursing Infomatics |date=April 2012 |volume=6 |issue=4 |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, other researchers find a more optimistic view of technology's relationship to multitasking. In ''Media as Extensions'', Lin (2009) determined that the hyperlinked structure of information on the web may promote learning and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Lin|title=Breadth-biased versus focused cognitive control in media multitasking behaviors|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=September 2009|volume=106|issue=37|pages=15521–15522|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15521.full|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=14 December 2012|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908642106|pmid=19805207|pmc=2747151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''American College Personnel Association - College Student Educators International''' is a major [[student affairs]] association headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[National Center for Higher Education]].

Founded in 1924 by [[May L. Cheney]], ACPA has 7,500 members representing 1,200 private and public institutions from across the U.S. and around the world. Members include organizations and companies that are engaged in the campus marketplace. Members also include graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in student affairs/higher education administration programs, faculty, and student affairs professionals, from entry level to senior student affairs officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myacpa.org/au/au_index.cfm ACPA Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219091154/http://www.myacpa.org/au/au_index.cfm |date=2008-12-19 }}.  September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual convention ==

Nearly 50% of ACPA's members attend the convention. Highlights of the convention include pre-convention workshops, over 300 educational sessions, interviewing at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611112731/http://careercentral.myacpa.org/home/index.cfm?site_id=8582], volunteering and networking opportunities. During the convention, job applicants and employers participate in one of the largest and most comprehensive placement service in student affairs. The 2013 convention will be in Las Vegas (2013), chaired by Karen Warren-Coleman (University of Chicago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myacpa.org/convention/upcoming.cfm ACPA Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219163126/http://www.myacpa.org/convention/upcoming.cfm |date=2008-12-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 Louisville Convention was chaired by Steve Sutton (University of California at Berkeley). Past convention chairs include Patricia Perillo (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University) for 2011, Robin Diana (Hartwick College) for 2010, Jonathan Poullard (University of California at Berkeley) for 2009, and Sue Saunders (University of Connecticut) for 2008.

== History ==

'''1924''' - [[May L. Cheney]], who organized a teacher placement office at the University of California, Berkeley helped form the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS). In 1924, NAAS met for the first time and came as guests of the [[National Association of Deans of Women]] (NADW) to a convention sponsored by the Department Superintendence of the National Education Association.

'''1929''' - Forty-six NAAS members registered for the Sixth Annual Convention. NAAS became the National Association of Personnel and Placement Officers (NAPPO).

'''1930s''' - The name [http://www.myacpa.org American College Personnel Association] (ACPA) was adopted in 1931. Association communication consisted of one mailed newsletter, the Personnel-O-Gram (P-O-G). In 1937, the Student Point of View statement was developed by leaders of the [http://www.acenet.edu American Council on Education] (ACE) and ACPA.

'''1940s''' - The Journal for Educational and Psychological Measurement (EPM) became the next form of the association's newsletter communication in 1943. In 1947, ACPA's President Daniel D. Feder's recommendation for formal unification efforts led to the formation of the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA). No conferences were held from 1943 through 1945 during World War Two.

'''1950s''' - The Personnel and Guidance Journal replaced EPM as ACPA's official journal in 1952. ACPA members approved the plan to form APGA. Membership reached 1,000 in 1952 and continued to increase through the next two decades. In 1959, Charles Lewis, the P-O-G associate editor was named the first editor of the Journal of College Student Personnel, ACPA's new official journal.

'''1970s''' - ACPA collaborated with other national organizations on many national conventions. In 1973, ACPA and NAWDC (formerly NADW) coordinated a national convention. The Standing Committee for Women was established in 1973. In 1974, NAWDAC (name change for NAWDC), NASPA and ACPA coordinated a national convention. In 1976, membership totaled 9,384 at a record high. The Standing Committee for Multicultural Affairs was founded in 1978. In 1979, ACPA became one of the first members of the  [[Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education]] (CAS).

'''1980s''' - ACPA flourished under the presidential leadership of outstanding student affairs practitioners and faculty members such as Susan Komives, Margaret "Peggy" Barr and Dennis Roberts. In 1983, ACPA was incorporated under the District of Columbia Non-Profit Act. In 1987, ACPA and NASPA held a joint meeting in Chicago to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Student Personnel Point of View statement. In 1988, ACPA's premier journal was renamed [https://web.archive.org/web/20070827071906/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/pub_jcsd.cfm THE JOURNAL COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT] (JCSD).

'''1990s''' - In 1991, after 40 years, ACPA leaders and members voted to disaffiliate from APGA, which was known as the American Association for Counseling and Development (AACD), and was later renamed the American Counseling Association (ACA). In September 1992, the separation became effective, and ACPA moved into a new office space at the National Center for Higher Education in Washington, D.C. Presidents Leila V. Moore (1991–92), Terry E. Williams (1992–93), Charles C. Schroeder (1986–87), Barbara Anderson (1994–95) and Harold E. Cheatham (1995–96) were all involved in this tremendous undertaking.

'''Early 2000''' - In 2003, Carmen Neuberger retired as Executive Director. Gregory Roberts, ACPA President from 1999–2000, was selected as the new Executive Director.

'''2010''' - The ACPA/NASPA Professional Competency Areas document was published by the Joint Task Force on Professional Competencies and Standards.

'''2011''' - After more than two years of work by the Consolidation Steering Team from ACPA and NASPA leaders, a voting process took place in March. Eighty-percent of ACPA members voted affirmed consolidation while eligible NASPA members who voted fell short of the required 2/3 majority. In the July/August 2011 issue of the Journal of Higher Education, ACPA's premier publication, THE JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT (JCSD) is ranked fourth among 50 Tier One journals in higher education. In a study by Nathaniel Bray and Claire Major, 106 out of 144 respondents reported that they read JCSD, and more than half of them cited JCSD in their work. This report continues JCSD's streak as the highest ranked journal in student affairs.

'''2012''' - ACPA appointed the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-appoints-credentialing-implementation-team Credentialing Implementation Team], launched the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-announces-institutional-leadership-councils-program Institutional Councils Program] and published its on-going [http://www2.myacpa.org/global-initiatives Global Initiatives].

* ''About Campus''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090517201424/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/About-Campus/abstracts.cfm] is a bimonthly magazine for those who want to thoughtfully examine the issues, policies, and practices that influence the learning experiences of college students. Even though About Campus is sponsored by ACPA, it addresses an audience that goes well beyond student affairs to include all those on campus (administrators, faculty, and staff) who are concerned with student learning.
* ''Enough Is Enough: A Student Affairs Perspective on Preparedness and Response to a Campus Shooting'' presents first-hand accounts and experienced counsel from professionals who have lived through a violent incident, and continue to deal with its aftermath. They cover violence, suicide prevention, and mental health promotion in an integrated way, and offer a comprehensive plan to create a campus-wide system for collecting information about students at-risk for self-harm or violence toward others. Editors: Brian O. Hemphill (Northern Illinois University) and Brandi Hephner LaBanc (Northern Illinois University).
* ''Multicultural Student Services on Campus'' constitutes a thorough introduction to the structure, organization, and scope of the services and educational mission for new professionals in multicultural student services (MSS). For senior practitioners it offers insights for re-evaluating their strategies, and inspiration to explore new possibilities. The book discusses the history and philosophy of MSS units; describes their operation; asserts the need for integration and coherence across the multiple facets of their work and how their role is influenced by the character and type of their institutions; and considers the challenges and opportunities ahead. Editor: Dafina Lazarus Stewart (Bowling Green State University).
* ''Making Good On The Promise'' gets to the heart of the experience o student affairs professionals with disabilities, to the curricular changes needed in preparation programs for that profession, to the role and appropriate action needed by allies, and to resources that all can use in the education of self and others. Editors: Jeanne L. Higbee (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities) and Alice A. Mitchell (University of Maryland College Park).
* ''Shifting Paradigms in Student Affairs'' is addressed to all student affairs professionals whose primary focus is student learning. Faculty members in preparation programs, senior administrators and student development educators in residence halls, student unions or career counseling offices will use the ideas presented in different ways. Nevertheless, the book has a common purpose for all readers which is to assert the educational functions of student affairs and services, and to situate student development education solidly within the mission of colleges and universities in the United States. Editor: Jane Fried (Central Connecticut State University).
* ''Empowering Women in Higher Education and Student Affairs'' addresses the experiences and position of women students, from application to college through graduate school, and the barriers they encounter; the continuing inequalities in the rates of promotion and progression of women and other marginalized groups to positions of authority, and the gap in earnings between men and women; and pays particular attention to how race and other social markers impact such disparities, contextualizing them across all institutional types. Editors: Penny A. Pasque (University of Oklahoma), Shelley Errington Nicholson.
* ''The First Generation Student Experience'' are 14 first-person narratives – by first-generation students spanning freshman to graduate years – that help the reader get to grips with the variety of ethnic and economic categories to which they belong. The book concludes by defining 14 key issues that institutions need to address, and offers a course of action for addressing them. By Jeff Davis.
* ''College Student Death: Guidance for a Caring Campus'' is the result of many years of collaboration with more than thirty contributors. This book applies the knowledge of university personnel called upon to respond to student death on and off campus and to provide solace to family and the campus community. It also provides support to university staff in the immediacy of student death, guides the design of policy before a crisis occurs, and provide instructional considerations for faculty. Editors: Rosa Cintrón (University of Central Florida), Erin Taylor Weathers, Katherine Garlough (Oklahoma City Community College).
* ''Where You Work Matters'' offers current and future administrators a greater appreciation for the vibrancy and complexity of the student affairs profession. This volume challenges the widely held assumption that the professional practice of student affairs administration transcends the influence of [[organizational culture]]. Based on data and commentaries from more than 1,100 practitioners, this book describes how the experience of student affairs administrators varies by institutional type. The findings paint a multifaceted and integrated portrait of the profession. Author: Joan B. Hirt (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University).
* ''Job One: Experiences of New Professionals in Student Affairs''[http://members.myacpa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/store/ItemDescription.html?Action=Cart_Item_Description&amp;InvID_Web=195&amp;Template=Books%20and%20Periodicals&amp;MarketName_W=&amp;ISBN_W=&amp;Start_W=1&amp;End_W=25&amp;NumToShow=25&amp;Volume_W=&amp;Time=1028557555&amp;SessionID=1942828260mf13my5o7d9o0jv7j56k0qn1b601g3m3nbpu73nfeal3c805z9fg1x] focuses on nine narratives written by new professionals about their introduction and transitions into student affairs.

'''Asociación de Inspectores de Educación''' (ADIDE) is a Spanish professional association of [[education]] supervisors. By the number of its members it is the most important association of these professionals in [[Spain]]: nowadays, 950 out of 1600 Spanish Inspectors of Education are members of ADIDE, while the rest of them are either unassociated or splitting their membership into several different [[professional association|associations]] and [[Trade union|unions]].

== Background ==

Educational professionals usually group themselves either in unions, professional associations or professional organizations. Unions have as their main aim the defence of the [[Employment|labour]] conditions of their members. Professional associations deal with the performance of the Code of Professional [[Ethics]] established by the association. Professional associations, like ADIDE, can have as well as the previous interests, some different aims and concerns, such as ensuring the professional development of members through suitable formation and [[training]], the organization of scientific meetings and congresses, and the [[publishing]] of professional magazines and books.

The [[Inspectorate]] of Education is a body (or two, actually) of [[civil servants]] of about 1600 people in Spain. This body of inspectors supervise all the [[Education in Spain|Spanish education system]] except the [[Spanish universities|university studies]]. Every inspector is usually in charge of several [[schools]] and other [[educational institutions]], and performs his/her duties according to an annual Inspection Plan. Quite often, however inspectors have to tackle with all kind of incidents and unscheduled situations which requires much attention from them.

== Founding ==

After the establishment of [[democracy]], the Spanish education system undertook very important changes in the 1980s, a time when a significant group of teachers and school administrators started to carry out the supervision function of schools. The already existing associations of inspectors of education at that time did not ensure the professional development of the new inspectors, so it was necessary for them to found a new association. ADIDE was created in 1990 and soon started to replace the absence of unions to achieve the promotion of professional interests and helping to put into practice the new educational policies as settled in the [[Education reform]] provided by the Organic Act of General Organization of the Educational System 1990.

Initially, ADIDE was a unique national organization for the whole of Spain, but due to the Association Act 2005, it had to adopt a [[Federation|federated]] [[structure]], which provoked some problems of interaction on the very first moments. The new technologies and members’ cooperation worked well to maintain a good level of coordination among all the federal associations, one for every one of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Spanish Autonomous Regions]], which hold a high level of independence in educational matters. The federated association is since then known as ADIDE-Federación, while every autonomous region association is known by the name of ADIDE followed by the name of the region it operates on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10953">In classrooms where '''assessment for learning''' is practised, students are encouraged to be more active in their learning and associated assessment. The ultimate purpose of assessment for learning is to create self-regulated learners who can leave school able and confident to continue learning throughout their lives. Teachers need to know at the outset of a unit of study where their students are in terms of their learning and then continually check on how they are progressing through strengthening the feedback they get from their learners. Students are guided on what they are expected to learn and what quality work looks like.  The teacher will work with the student to understand and identify any gaps or misconceptions (initial/diagnostic [[Educational assessment|assessment]]). As the unit progresses, the teacher and student work together to assess the student's knowledge, what she or he needs to learn to improve and extend this knowledge, and how the student can best get to that point ([[formative assessment]]). Assessment for learning occurs at all stages of the learning process.

Researchers whose work has informed much of this assessment reform include Ken O'Connor, Grant Wiggins,&lt;ref name=ltag&gt;http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Jay McTighe,&lt;ref name=ltag/&gt; Richard Stiggins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assessmentinst.com/author/rick-stiggins/|title=Assessment Training Institute|website=www.assessmentinst.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Black, [[Dylan Wiliam]], Chris Harrison, Bethan Marshall, Gordon Stobart, Caroline Gipps, Joanna Goodman, Thomas Guskey, Damian Cooper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damiancooperassessment.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Perrenoud, Royce Sadler, Bronwen Cowie, Margaret Heritage and Ronán Howe.

==Historical perspective==
In past decades, teachers would design a unit of study that would typically include objectives, teaching strategies, and resources.  The student's mark on this test or exam was taken as the indicator of his or her understanding of the topic. In 1998, Black &amp; Wiliam produced a review that highlighted that students who learn in a formative way achieve significantly better than matched control groups receiving normal teaching. Their seminal work developed into several important research projects on Assessment for Learning by the King's College team including Kings-Medway-Oxfordshire Formative Assessment Project (KMOFAP), Assessment is For learning (Scotland), Jersey-Actioning-Formative assessment (Channel Islands), and smaller projects in England, Wales, Peru, and the USA.

==Complex assessment==
A complex assessment is the one that requires a rubric and an expert examiner. Example items for complex assessment include thesis, funding proposal, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ho Sung Kim, Quantification for complex assessment: uncertainty estimation in final year project thesis assessment, European Journal of Engineering Education, 2013, pp 1-16 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2012.742869&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Ho Sung Kim, Uncertainty analysis for peer assessment final year project, European Journal of Engineering Education, Vol 39 (1), 2014, pp 68-83 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2013.833171&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of assessment is due to the format implicitness. In the past it has been puzzling to deal with the ambiguous assessment criteria for final year project (FYP) thesis assessment. Webster, Pepper and Jenkins (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F., D. Pepper, and A. Jenkins. 2000. “Assessing the undergraduate dissertation.” Assessment &amp; Evaluation in
Higher Education, 25 (1): 71–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
discussed some common general criteria for FYP thesis and their ambiguity regarding use, meaning and application. Woolf (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, H., 2004. “Assessment criteria: reflections on current practices.” Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education,
29 (4): 439–493.&lt;/ref&gt;
more specifically stated on the FYP assessment criterion weighting:‘The departments are as silent on the weightings that they apply to their criteria as they are on the
number of criteria that contribute to a grade’. A more serious concern was raised by Shay (2004) who argued that the FYP assessment for engineering and social sciences is ‘a socially situated
interpretive act’, implying that many different alternative interpretations and grades are possible for one assessment task. The problems with the FYP thesis assessment have thus received much
attention over the decades since the assessment difficulty was discussed by Black (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Black, J., 1975. “Allocation and assessment of project work in the final year of engineering degree course at the University of Bath”. Assessment in Higher Education, 1 (1): 35–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are a number of assessment terms that will appear in any discussion of assessment. Listed below are common interpretations of some of these terms:

'''Assessment'''
A working definition of [[Educational assessment|Assessment]] for learning from a widely cited article contends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the term 'assessment' refers to all those activities undertaken,,,
by teachers, and by their students in assessing themselves, which
provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged.&lt;ref name="BlackBox"&gt;Black, P.J. &amp; Wiliam, D. (1998) Inside the Black Box: Raising standards through classroom assessment. King's College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since this seminal article, educators have differentiated assessment according to its purpose:

'''Assessment for learning'''

*comprises two phases—initial or diagnostic assessment and formative assessment
*assessment can be based on a variety of information sources (e.g., portfolios, works in progress, teacher observation, conversation)
*verbal or written feedback to the student is primarily descriptive and emphasizes strengths, identifies challenges, and points to next steps
*as teachers check on understanding they adjust their instruction to keep students on track
*no grades or scores are given - record-keeping is primarily anecdotal and descriptive
*occurs throughout the learning process, from the outset of the course of study to the time of summative assessment

'''Assessment as learning'''
*begins as students become aware of the goals of instruction and the criteria for performance
*involves goal-setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on results
*implies student ownership and responsibility for moving his or her thinking forward (metacognition)
*occurs throughout the learning process

'''Assessment of learning'''
*assessment that is accompanied by a number or letter grade (summative)
*compares one student's achievement with standards
*results can be communicated to the student and parents
*occurs at the end of the learning unit

'''Evaluation'''
*judgment made on the basis of a student's performance

'''Diagnostic assessment (now referred to more often as "pre-assessment")
*assessment made to determine what a student does and does not know about a topic
*assessment made to determine a student's learning style or preferences
*used to determine how well a student can perform a certain set of skills related to a particular subject or group of subjects
*occurs at the beginning of a unit of study
*used to inform instruction:makes up the initial phase of assessment for learning

'''Formative assessment'''
*assessment made to determine a student's knowledge and skills, including learning gaps as they progress through a unit of study
*used to inform instruction and guide learning
*occurs during the course of a unit of study
*makes up the subsequent phase of assessment for learning

'''Summative assessment'''
*assessment that is made at the end of a unit of study to determine the level of understanding the student has achieved
*includes a mark or grade against an expected standard

==Principles==
Among the most comprehensive listing of principles of assessment for learning are those written by the QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority). The authority, which is sponsored by England's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]], is responsible for national curriculum, assessment, and examinations. Their principal focus is on crucial aspects of assessment for learning, including how such assessment should be seen as central to classroom practice, and that all teachers should regard assessment for learning as a key professional skill.

The UK Assessment Reform Group (1999) identifies "The big 5 principles of assessment for learning"

# The provision of effective feedback to students.
# The active involvement of students in their own learning.
# Adjusting teaching to take account of the results of assessment.
# Recognition of the profound influence assessment has on the motivation and self-esteem of pupils, both of which are critical influences on learning.
# The need for students to be able to assess themselves and understand how to improve.

===Feedback===

The purpose of an Assessment for Learning (AFL) task is to provide feedback to both the teacher and learner regarding the learner's progress towards achieving the learning objective(s).  This feedback should be used by the teacher to revise and develop further instruction.  An effective AFL method is to use a performance task coupled with a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]]. This type of assessment is fundamental in illustrating how and why such principles need to be adhered to.

'''Book-and-record sets''' are a form of entertainment for children, consisting of a picture storybook (often in [[comic book]] format, with drawings or photos) and an accompanying recording (originally in the form of a [[vinyl record]]; later in [[cassette tape]] and [[compact disc]] formats) to be played while following along with the book. The record and book complement one another, with the record usually a [[radio theater]]-style version of the story or a [[soundtrack]] recording, and the book providing visuals and text to the story. Often a tone or other kind of cue in the recording will prompt the reader to turn pages.

Book-and-record sets are popular as teaching tools and aids to reading, and as a simple form of [[multimedia]] entertainment. [[Cartoon characters]] are common subjects (or stars) of the stories, as are comic book [[superhero|superheroes]] and other [[Franchise (media)|media franchises]], characters and personalities. Occasionally popular children's or family movies are adapted for book and record; the stories may either be re-presented by a new cast of performers, members of the movie cast, or the audio taken directly from the movie, with narration added.

[[Disneyland Records]] and related companies produced several such works, as did [[Peter Pan Records]] (and its offshoot [[Power Records (Peter Pan records)|Power Records]]) and others, from the dawn of [[long-playing records]] and the [[45rpm single]] until the digital age. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Capitol Records]] produced many book-and-record sets for children, ranging from everything from [[Bozo the Clown]] to the classical music fantasy ''[[Sparky's Magic Piano]]''. A "picture storybook" of the 1982 movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' narrated by [[Michael Jackson]] became a highly prized [[collectible]], after it went out of print. Newer sets may still be found among recordings for children.

'''Busy Beavers''' (also known as '''We Are Busy Beavers''') is an online children’s educational program. It is aimed at parents and teachers of toddlers who speak English or are learning English as a second language, and parents of children with a learning disability, [[autism]] or delayed speech.
The Busy Beavers [[YouTube channel]] and website provide [[interactive media]] to help teach children. Their YouTube channel has over 2 billion views, and over 2 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/10182275/YouTube-success-with-kids-videos|title=YouTube success with kids' videos|last=Anthony|first=John|date=2014-06-22|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2004, Dave Martin created Busy Beavers as an online business that produces children’s educational videos on YouTube and DVDs.
In March 2014, he launched a YouTube premium channel called ''Busy Beavers TV'' that gives the subscribers, all of Busy Beavers’ existing videos ad-free and in high definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Busy Beavers children's YouTube channel ready to take on world|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/87551713/Busy-Beavers-childrens-YouTube-channel-ready-to-take-on-world|website=Stuff|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Busy Beavers joined the [[Channel Frederator Network]], and is the number one channel (by views) of the [[Multi-channel network|Multi-Channel Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/network/channel_frederator_network/topusers/mostviewed|title=Top 100 Networked YouTubers in Channel_frederator_network Sorted by Most Viewed - Socialblade.com|website=socialblade.com|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Busy Beavers and Baby Beavers have both been added to [[Roku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://suzguru.com/wordpress/index.php/2016/04/12/new-roku-channels-april-8-2016/|title=New Roku Channels – April 8, 2016|date=2016-04-12|newspaper=suzguru.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kidoodle.TV in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvkids/kidoodle-tv-adds-four-new-titles-to-catalog/|title=Kidoodle.TV Adds Four New Titles to Catalog - TVKIDS|date=2016-09-05|newspaper=TVKIDS|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also created an app for iOS and Android called ''Busy Beavers Jukebox''.

[[Image:Cheating.JPG|thumb|right|A cheat sheet that is used contrary to the rules of an exam may need to be small enough to conceal in the [[palm (hand)|palm of the hand]]]]
[[Image:Spicker trinkflasche.jpg|thumb|Cheat sheet in a [[juicebox (container)|juice box]]]]
A '''cheat sheet''' (also ''cheatsheet'') or '''crib sheet''' is a concise set of notes used for quick reference.

Cheat sheets are so named because they may be used by students without the instructor's knowledge to [[Cheating|cheat]] on a [[Test (assessment)|test]]. However, at higher levels of education where [[rote learning|rote memorization]] is not as important as in basic education, students may be permitted to consult their own notes during the exam (which is not considered cheating).  The act of preparing a crib sheet can be an educational exercise, and students are sometimes only allowed to use crib sheets they have written themselves. 

A cheat sheet is a physical piece of paper, often filled with equations and/or facts in compressed writing. Students often print cheat sheets in extremely small font, fitting an entire page of notes in the palm of their hands during the exam.

Crib sheets are also fully worked solutions for exams or work sheets normally handed out to university staff in order to ease marking.

==As reference cards==
{{Main|Reference card}}
In more general usage, a crib sheet is any short (one or two page) reference to terms, commands, or symbols where the user is expected to understand the use of such terms but not necessarily to have memorized all of them.  Many computer applications, for example, have crib sheets included in their documentation, which list keystrokes or menu commands needed to achieve specific tasks to save the user the effort of digging through an entire manual to find the keystroke needed to, for example, move between two windows.  An example of such a crib sheet is one for the [[GIMP]] photo editing software.&lt;ref name="Keys and Mouse Reference"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.gimp.org/en/key-reference.html |title=GIMP Keys and Mouse Reference |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include "Read Me First" and "Quick Reference Card" documents included with consumer electronics.

Some academic and technical publishers also publish crib sheets for software packages and technical topics.  In some cases these are also intended as display items in that they are colorful and visually appealing. Web-based crib sheets, such as references to terms, commands, or symbols, have become extremely common.

'''Cognitive rigor''' is a combined model developed by superimposing two existing models for describing [[Rigour|rigor]] that are widely accepted in the [[Educators|education]] system in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="eric"&gt;Hess, K., Jones, B.S., Carlock, D., &amp; Walkup, J.R. (2009). Cognitive Rigor: Blending the strengths of Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge to enhance classroom-level processes. [Technical Report]. Retrieved from ERIC database. (ED517804). http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED517804.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept "is marked and measured by the depth and extent students are challenged and engaged to demonstrate and communicate their knowledge and thinking" and also "marks and measures the depth and complexity of student learning experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edge.ascd.org/blogpost/what-is-cognitive-rigor|title=ASCD EDge - What Is Cognitive Rigor?|website=edge.ascd.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognition|Cognitive]] Rigor is the superposition of [[Bloom's Taxonomy]] and [[Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge]] levels and is used to categorize the level of [[abstraction]] of questions and activities in education.  The Cognitive Rigor Matrix assists applying Cognitive Rigor in the classroom.&lt;ref name="eric" /&gt;  These models are intended for use in [[curriculum]] development and lesson planning so that students acquire the rigorous skills and knowledge needed for post-secondary education.&lt;ref name="eric" /&gt;

The idea of interlacing Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge to create a new tool for measuring curricular quality was completed in 2005 by Karin Hess of the [[National Center for Assessment in Higher Education|National Center for Assessment]], producing a 4 X 6 matrix (the Cognitive Rigor Matrix or Hess Matrix) for categorizing the Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels for each activity or question appearing in curricular materials. The Cognitive Rigor Matrix aligns the six Bloom’s Taxonomy levels along the columns of the matrix and the four Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels along the rows.

Working independently, John Walkup and Ben Jones of The Standards Company LLC developed an identical matrix in 2007 and used it to measure the cognitive rigor of completed student work collected from two large-scale studies of the enacted curriculum in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="nevada"&gt;The Standards Company LLC. (2008a). “Study of the alignment of student assignments to the  academic standards in the state of Nevada pursuant to Senate Bill 184, Chap. 420, Statutes of  Nevada 2007.” Retrieved April 13, 2009, from Legislative Counsel Bureau, Nevada State Legislature, technical report, http://www.leg.state.nv.us/lcb/fiscal/Final_ReportCurriculum_Study.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oklahoma"&gt;The Standards Company LLC. (2008b). “Analysis of the enacted curriculum for the Oklahoma State Department of Education for the collection period February – March, 2008.” Oklahoma State Department of Education, unpublished technical report.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hess, et al. published a paper defining Cognitive Rigor, describing how the model overcomes limitations of using Bloom's Taxonomy, and describing the model's use.&lt;ref name="eric"/&gt; The paper shows how Bloom's Taxonomy identifies processes (categorizes cognitive skills), and Webb's Depth of Knowledge shows quantification and application (focuses on depth of understanding and scope of content).  The combined models further the application of Bloom's Taxonomy to testing and assessment applications.  The Cognitive Rigor Matrix included in the article is often made available as a separate document, with example activities included in each cell of the matrix.&lt;ref name="static.pdesas"&gt;Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix and Curricular Examples: Applying Webb’s Depth-of-Knowledge Levels to Bloom’s Cognitive Process Dimensions – English Language Arts. http://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/M1-Slide_22_DOK_Hess_Cognitive_Rigor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="static.pdesas_a"&gt;Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix and Curricular Examples: Applying Webb’s Depth-of-Knowledge Levels to Bloom’s Cognitive Process Dimensions – Mathematics and Science. http://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/M2-Activity_2_Handout.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium]] adopted the concept of Cognitive Rigor and the Hess Matrix in 2012 to measure the rigor of test items for the Next Generation of Assessments.&lt;ref name="sbac"&gt;Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

It is often synonymous with '''honor roll''' and '''honor list''', but should not be confused with [[Honours degree|honours degrees]].

Generally, students enrolled in college or university would need to satisfy a series of specific requirements before receiving the Dean's List. These requirements may differ across institutions, but in most cases will require students to enroll in a [[full-time]] capacity, to achieve a specific [[Grade Point Average|grade point average]] within the [[academic term]], and to maintain a specific [[cumulative grade point average]] throughout enrollment. Universities may often establish further rewards, such as Annual Dean's Lists, for students that demonstrate even greater academic distinction. As such, a Dean's List and its direct derivatives are usually intended for students that demonstrate highest scholarship across multiple disciplines, and not necessarily bound to a specific field of study.

Over time, the Dean's List has also led to the creation of additional rewards with similar nomenclatures, including the [[provost (education)|Provost's]] List,&lt;ref name="Wyoming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/general_information/provosts_list.html|title=Office of the Registrar: Provost's List|last=|first=|date=|work=University of Wyoming|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=January 11, 2017|quote=The requirements to be met are as follows: 1.

== Distinction ==
=== Comparison to North American Latin honors ===

{{Main|Latin honors}}
Although the Dean's List and Latin honors may both be issued in recognition of high scholarship, they are mostly separate awards not intended for direct comparison.
Many institutions confer three levels of Latin honors, as follows:
* ''cum laude'', meaning "with praise" (or "with honor")&lt;ref&gt;The usual translation of ''[[wiktionary:laude#Latin|laude]]'' from [[Latin]] is "with praise".&lt;/ref&gt;
** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 25% (or 30%) of their class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-studentlink/registration-records-and-graduation/graduation-and-diplomas/graduation-honors.html|title=Graduation Honors|date=|work=NYU|publisher=New York University|accessdate=January 12, 2017|quote=Effective with the September 2008 graduating class,... the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. ''Summa cum laude'': the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. ''Magna cum laude'': the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. ''Cum laude'': the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/reg/graduation/latin-honors/|title=Latin Honors|work=BU, Office of the University Registrar|publisher=[[Boston University]]|accessdate=January 12, 2017|quote=Among graduating seniors in each school or college, Latin Honors are awarded to the top 30% of the class as follows: Summa Cum Laude Top 5%, Magna Cum Laude Next 10%, Cum Laude Next 15%}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''magna cum laude'', meaning "with great honor"
** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 10% (or 15%) of their class; this is the highest honor awarded at some institutions.
* ''summa cum laude'', meaning "with highest honor"
** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 1-5% of their class.

Because Latin honors are often conferred to the approximate class rank whereby students also receive the Dean's List (as the top 10-15%), '''''magna''''' and '''''summa cum laude''''' are usually held in higher regard. A Dean's List may therefore be seen as equal to (or more prestigious than) '''''cum laude''','' depending on the specific requirements involved.

===Comparison to GPA ===
The Dean's List [[GPA]] requirements vary from school to school, although there are general standards:
* With the GPA scale from 0 to 4, 4 being an A, the dean's list cutoff is typically around 3.5-3.7.&lt;ref name="Wyoming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://students.cfaes.ohio-state.edu/node/674|title=Dean's List|work=OSU.EDU|publisher=[[The Ohio State University]]|accessdate=January 11, 2017|quote=Students completing a minimum of 12 graded credit hours with a GPA of 3.5 or higher for any given term will be named to the Dean's List for that term in the college in which they are enrolled. Courses graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) or pass/non-pass (PA/NP) do not count toward the minimum 12 graded hours, and a grade of U, E, EN, or NP will disqualify you from making the Dean's List, even if you meet the 3.5 criteria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/stu-adv/deanslist.php | title = Dean's List Requirements | publisher = [[Cornell University]] |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2012-01-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120901214822/http://www.arts.cornell.edu/stu-adv/deanslist.php | archive-date = September 1, 2012 | quote = Minimum GPA Required: 12 Credits --- 3.85 or higher, 13 or 14 credits --- 3.75 or higher, 15 or 16 credits --- 3.65 or higher, 17 or more credits --- 3.55 or higher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://falk.syr.edu/students/awards-scholarships/deans-list/ | title = Falk College Spring 2016 Dean’s List | work = Falk College | publisher = [[Syracuse University]] | date = January 11, 2017 | quote = Students at the College are named to Dean’s list when they have achieved a minimum of a 3.4 semester grade point average and have earned at least 12 credit hours of course work. Students receive a certificate of achievement from Dean Murphy and often cite this honor on their resume, portfolio or when applying for employment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/front/Deans_List.html | title = Dean's List | work = University of Washington | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | accessdate = January 11, 2017 | quote = The Quarterly Dean's List includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who are pursuing their first undergraduate degree and have attained a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in the final grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate entries regarding inclusion on the Dean's List are made on the student's permanent academic record.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Top 10% of the class in GPA&lt;ref name="Wharton" /&gt;

Some schools maintain two lists for two different levels of GPA. For example, the dean's list records students with at least a 3.5 GPA whereas the chancellor's list records students with a higher 4.0 GPA.&lt;ref name="IU-Southeast"&gt;{{cite press release|title=More than 1,000 IU Southeast students honored for academics in spring semester|date=June 7, 2016|publisher=[[Indiana University Southeast]]|location=New Albany, Indiana|url=https://now.ius.edu/2016/06/more-than-1000-iu-southeast-students-honored-for-academics-in-spring-semester/|quote=The Dean’s and Chancellor’s lists both recognize students who have achieved outstanding semester honors in academics. Those named to the Chancellor’s List received highest academic honors in the spring semester.|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNC-Asheville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzaga-Honors"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gonzaga.edu/news-and-events/university-honors/default.asp | title = University Honors | work = Gonzaga University | publisher = Gonzaga University | quote = Welcome to the Gonzaga University Honors webpage, showcasing students who have achieved academic excellence and earned a place on either our President's List or the Dean's List. These lists are published twice a year following the completion of the fall and spring semesters. | accessdate = January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different from an academic [[scholarship]], the dean's list award does not come with any [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]]. However, students high on the dean's list are often offered extra financial aid, especially if they express a desire to transfer or exhibit more financial need.

=== Comparison to European classifications ===
In Europe, [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] may utilize variations of the [[British undergraduate degree classification|British degree classifications]] to distinguish students of high scholarship. The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom, for example, was developed in 1918.&lt;ref name="Alderman2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|title=Tear up the class system|last=Alderman|first=Geoffrey|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was implemented based on one from the 16th century, when the [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] implemented [[Norm-referenced test|norm referencing]] to distinguish the top 25% of candidates, the next 50%, and the bottom 25%.&lt;ref name="Alderman2" /&gt;

Today, '''first-class honours''' (commonly referred to as "'''first-hons'''") is awarded, by most institutions, to any student that receives a grade of 70% or higher (as opposed to classification by class rank). The number of first-class honours degrees has reportedly tripled since the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Paton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9792964/Number-of-first-class-degrees-has-tripled-since-late-90s.html|title=Number of first-class degrees "has tripled since late 90s"|last=Paton|first=Graeme|date=10 January 2013|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been concern over possible [[grade inflation]] due to increasing numbers of higher-class honours degrees awarded per annum.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/12/first-class-degrees-concern|title=Is the number of first-class degrees cause for concern?|work=The Guardian|deadurl=no|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/16/first-class-degrees-concern-update|title=Is the number of first-class degrees cause for concern: Update|last=Shepherd|first=Jessica|date=17 January 2012|publisher=The Guardian|deadurl=no|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Early Years Professional Status''' (EYPS) is a professional status for practitioners in England at the Early Years Foundation Stage (ages 0 – 5), which is intended to be broadly equivalent to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (ages 5 – 18). Introduced by the British government in 2007, via the Children's Workforce Development Council, EYPS courses require a degree, and include an assessment in an early years setting - either a placement or within the trainee's own early years workplace. In Scotland the Childhood Practice Award (either a professional development award, a practice based ordinary degree or a post-graduate diploma) similarly requires those who lead and manage Early Years (In Scotland Childhood Practice incorporates all those working in non-compulsory children's services 0-16).&lt;ref&gt;http://learningzone.workforcesolutions.sssc.uk.com/course/view.php?id=15&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, all early years children's centres in England  (of which there are nearly 3000) will be required to have at least one Early Years Professional (EYP), and by 2015, all full daycare settings will be required to have at least one,&lt;ref name=guardian280409&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 28 April 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/apr/27/early-years-staff The poor professionals]&lt;/ref&gt; which will require 20,000 EYPs.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 August 2008, [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/07/primaryschools.educationsgendergap Under-fives have almost no male teachers]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009 there were more than 2,500 graduate-level EYPs and a further 2,400 in training in 35 higher education institutions.&lt;ref name=guardian280409/&gt; In Scotland, since 2011, it is a registration requirement with SSSC (Scottish Social Service Council) that all leaders and managers who are in charge of EY centres, nurseries or family centres must have  a Level 9 qualification ( SCQF) which is equivalent to an ordinary degree.

Government funding is available (via the Graduate Leader Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwdcouncil.org.uk/eyps/funding CWDC - Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;) to support private, voluntary or independent sector daycare in gaining EYPS status,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 February 2007, [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/feb/27/schools.earlyyearseducation Early tears]&lt;/ref&gt; but is not currently available for the 20% of England's  early years childcare workforce which is run by the government.&lt;ref name=guardian280409/&gt;

Pay for EYPs however is often only half that of a [[Newly Qualified Teacher]], at £8-9/hr.&lt;ref name=guardian280409/&gt;

The '''Education act of 1872''' removed state funding of non-government schools, and created a new Education Department to control government schools in what later became the [[State of Victoria]].

==Contemporary reporting==
On 17 December 1872 the Act went through the [[Parliament of Victoria|Parliament]]. The [[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]] reported the next day on the close of the Parliamentary session:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...we must acknowledge that the (Parliamentary) session has been by no means a barren one. If the Education Act of 1872 had been the solitary law added to the Statute
book during its continuance, that alone would be sufficient to make it memorable in the annals of Victoria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When we consider the difficulties which attend all attempts to deal with the much vexed question of public instruction, the prejudices which have to be overcome, and the sectarian enmity which has to be encountered, we may well be grateful that the Government measure passed through the ordeal it had to undergo in both Houses without the sacrifice of any of those vital principles it was and is intended to establish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the first time in this colony, the young will now have an opportunity of acquiring the rudiments of education unmixed with the leaven of sectarianism, and every child, no matter what its parents' circumstances may be, will receive at the hands of the state that key which, rightly used, unlocks whole stores of knowledge, from whose ample treasures the patient and industrious may freely help themselves. If due effect be given to the compulsory clauses, none will grow up in that gross ignorance which is such a fruitful mother of crime, which fills our gaols, and yearly robs honest industry of a large portion of its reward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, a great deal will depend on the manner in which the new act is worked ; but if care be taken to administer it in the spirit which actuated its framers, we confidently expect to see the most beneficial effects flow from its operation."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are primary schools on most of the inhabited islands. Secondary schools are located on some of the islands with students travelling to live at their school. For example, [[Abaiang]], which is in the northern [[Gilbert Islands]],&lt;ref name="A2012"&gt;{{cite web| last =  | first = | work= Office of Te  Beretitent - Republic of Kiribati Island Report Series|title= 4.

A further 135 students are enrolled at St Joseph’s College in [[Tabwiroa]] and 23 students at Steven Whitmee High School in [[Morikao]], making 370 secondary school students in total.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt; The two high schools at Morikao and Tabuiroa accommodate students from all over Kiribati who have passed the entrance examinations to get into the schools.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt;

St. Joseph's College was founded in 1939. Its alumni include both current President [[Anote Tong]], and previous incumbent [[Teburoro Tito]].

There are primary schools and secondary schools operated by the Christian denominations including the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (such as St. Joseph's College) and the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], (such as Moroni High School in [[South Tarawa]], of which [[Waitea Abiuta]] has been the headmaster).

The Kiribati Teacher College and King George V and  Elaine Bernachi School, the Government High School, are in [[Bikenibeu]] in [[South Tarawa]].&lt;ref name="ST2012"&gt;{{cite web| last =  | first = | work= Office of Te  Beretitent - Republic of Kiribati Island Report Series|title= 6.

Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend [[University of the South Pacific]], and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172788770.html Pacific Magazine: I-Kiribati Students Perform Well In Cuba], Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of the South Pacific has a campus in Kiribati for distant/flexible learning, but also to provide preparatory studies towards obtaining certificates, diplomas and degrees at other campus sites.

==Schools==
[[Kiribati Ministry of Education]] is the education ministry. Kiribati has 94 elementary schools, 24 junior high schools, and 16 senior high schools.

[[Image:Edupunk.jpg|thumb|Jim Groom as "poster boy" for edupunk]]
'''Edupunk''' is a [[do it yourself]] (DIY) attitude to teaching and learning practices.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keats"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/16-10/st_jw | title = Jargon Watch: Green Crude, Popcorning, Edupunk | author = Keats, Jonathon | publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] | date = 2008-09-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Kuntz described edupunk as "an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ’70s bands like The Clash to the classroom."&lt;ref name="kuntz"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuntz|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructional applications can be described as DIY education or ''edupunk''.

The term was first used on May 25, 2008, by [[Jim Groom]] in his blog,&lt;ref name="groom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/the-glass-bees/ | title = The Glass Bees | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-25 | accessdate = 2008-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered less than a week later in the [[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]].&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; [[Stephen Downes]], an [[online education]] theorist and an editor for the ''[[International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning]]'', noted that "the concept of edupunk has totally caught wind, spreading through the blogosphere like wildfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44760 | title = Introducing Edupunk | author = [[Stephen Downes]] | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Edupunk has risen from an objection to the efforts of government and [[Corporatism|corporate interests]] in reframing and bundling [[emerging technologies]] into ''[[wikt:cookie-cutter|cookie-cutter]]'' products with pre-defined application—somewhat similar to traditional [[punk ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mortarboard/2008/06/punk_or_more_precisely.html | title = Nevermind the pedagogues, here's edupunk | author = Cohen, David | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2008-06-16 | location=London | date=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to corporate influence on education is only one part of edupunk, though. Stephen Downes has identified three aspects to this approach:
* Reaction against [[commercialization]] of learning
* [[DIY ethic|Do-it-yourself attitude]]
* Thinking and learning for yourself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rowell | first = Laurie | title = "Edupunk" Rocks the (Virtual) House | newspaper = eLearn Magazine  | date = 2008-07-08 | url = http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&amp;article=65-1 | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of edupunk was the [[University of British Columbia]]'s course "[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Murder Madness and Mayhem]]" experiment of creating articles on [[Wikipedia]] in spring 2008, "(having) one’s students as partners and peers."&lt;ref name="mayhem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/murder-madness-mayhem/ | title = Murder, Madness, Mayhem is so EDUPUNK&lt;!--(sic)--&gt; | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video clip illustrating an edupunk approach, produced by Tony Hirst at the Open University in the UK, on 8 June 2008, illustrated how quickly the edupunk concept has been adopted outside North America.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTlescIvW0 | title = Changing Expectations| author = Hirst, A.| publisher = YouTube | date = 2008-06-08 | accessdate = 2008-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A website set up by Australian educators illustrates how edupunk spread,&lt;ref name="ausedupunk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edupunk.com.au | title = edupunk | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827204329/http://www.edupunk.com.au/ | archivedate = 2008-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a presentation by [[Norm Friesen]] of [[Thompson Rivers University]] identifies a number of possible intellectual precursors for the movement.

[[Hampshire College]], [[Evergreen State College]], [[Marlboro College]], [[New College of Florida]], and [[Warren Wilson College]] are collegiate institutions imbued with edupunk ideology.&lt;ref name="Friesenpres"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blip.tv/play/AeuPI4OyJA | title = The Edupunk Heritage: Precursors of Open Learning | author = [[Norm Friesen]] | publisher = Blip.tv | date = 2009-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friesenart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/Open_Education:_Precursors| title = Open Education: Precursors | author = [[Norm Friesen]]| publisher = WikiEducator | date = 2009-02-22 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodes Project, which examines the experience of female [[Rhodes Scholars]], was created in 2004 by [[Ann Olivarius]].&lt;ref name="Susan Rudy" /&gt; Rhodes Scholars are chosen from around the world for graduate study at the University of Oxford. The project showcases research on the lack of career-support networks, based on interviews and data from female Rhodes Scholars who were born in the 1950s to 1980s and who earned graduate and professional degrees until the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Susan Rudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rudy|first1=Susan|title=The Rhodes Project: Celebrating many versions of what women can be|url=http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-rhodes-project-celebrating-many-versions-of-what-women-can-be/|website=Oxford Human Rights Club|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Mission |url=http://rhodesproject.com/mission/ |website=The Rhodes Project |accessdate=9 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219113257/http://rhodesproject.com/mission/ |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is interested in how this data reflects the current situation of women.

Many financial institutions, governments and independent organizations have developed '''financial literacy curricula'''. A financial literacy [[curriculum]] teaches basic [[financial]] skills to students of various age groups. Some curricula are age specific while others seeks to teach universal principles to those of all ages.

==FDIC Money Smart==
Developed by the U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], Money Smart for Young Adults is a financial literacy curriculum designed for students between the ages of 12 and 20. It has 8 modules, each of which take approximately 110 minutes to complete. Money Smart for Young Adults focuses on saving, debt, home ownership. Money Smart for Young Adults does not currently offer an investing module.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/moneysmart/young.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frames of Reference''''' is a 1960 black-and-white [[educational film]] directed by [[Richard Leacock]], written and presented by [[Patterson Hume]] and [[Donald Ivey]], and produced for the [[Physical Science Study Committee]].&lt;ref name="Turner1962"&gt;{{Cite article|last=Turner|first=Joseph|date=4 May 1962| url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/136/3514/357 |title= Art for Science's Sake |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 136 |number = 3514 |page= 359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film was made to be shown in high school physics courses and humor is employed both to hold students' interest and to demonstrate the concepts being discussed. In the film, [[University of Toronto]] [[physics]] professors [[Patterson Hume]] and [[Donald Ivey]] explain the distinction between [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[Non-inertial reference frame|noninertial]] [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]],&lt;ref name="Turner1962"/&gt; while demonstrating these concepts through humorous camera tricks. For example, the film opens with Dr. Hume, who appears to be upside down, accusing Dr. Ivey of being upside down. Only when the pair flip a coin and it floats up does it become obvious that Dr. Ivey&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;and the camera&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; are indeed inverted.&lt;ref name="Turner1962"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">Graduate Enrollment Management (GEM) is an area of [[Enrollment management]] focused on graduate and professional education.

==History==
In 2013, the [[National Association of Graduate Admissions Professionals]] (NAGAP), changed its name to [[NAGAP]], The Association for Graduate Enrollment Management and in 2014 the term started to gain more traction, appearing in publications from both NAGAP and [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]] (AACRAO)&lt;ref&gt;https://aacrao-web.s3.amazonaws.com/files/ERRrFKrUSgKa26VLIPL2_CUJ8903_WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nagap.org/about-nagap|title=About NAGAP - NAGAP|website=www.nagap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In 2014, NAGAP rolled out the following definition for graduate enrollment management: 
graduate enrollment management is a systematic approach to managing enrollment and the graduate student lifecycle from awareness to alumnus by integrating the core functions associated with the support of a graduate student. GEM represents a synthesis of traditional student support areas into seamless, cross-functional operations designed to integrated stakeholders, consolidate key assessment mechanisms, and bolster service levels.

A longer definition of GEM followed: 
graduate enrollment management (GEM) represents a comprehensive approach to the methods by which an institution recruits, admits, supports, retains, and graduates post-baccalaureate students in their respective degree programs.  This dynamic paradigm includes codependent functions working congruently to strategically manage overall enrollment levels and the student experience.  These include enrollment planning, marketing, recruitment and admissions, advisement/coaching, financial aid, student services, retention, and alumni relations.  

Regardless of staffing levels, integrated interdependence in GEM will ideally create an environment whereby a cross-trained professional from a graduate office is able to support a student throughout their time at the institution.  This approach creates an environment that sustains differentiated student experiences.

==Organizations==
A number of organizations focus on the field of GEM. Some of the more prominent organizations are:&lt;br&gt;
[[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]]&lt;br&gt;[[NAGAP]], the Association for Graduate Enrollment Management &lt;BR&gt;

[[National Association of Student Personnel Administrators]]

'''Harlan Philip Hanson''' (February 18, 1925 – November 28, 1996), also known as "Harpo" Hanson, was an American educator and the Director of the [[Advanced Placement]] Program from 1965 to 1989.&lt;ref name =Saxon1/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mathews"/&gt;

==Harvard and WWII==
Born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 1925, Hanson attended [[Harvard University]] in the early 1940s but his education at Harvard was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into service with the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]].  After [[World War II]], he returned to Harvard where he graduated ''[[Summa cum laude#Types|summa cum laude]]'' in 1948.&lt;ref name=Saxon1&gt;{{cite news |first=Wolfgang |last= Saxon|authorlink= |title=Harlan P.

&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, Hanson was senior tutor at Kirkland House where he resided with his wife and [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]] graduate, Dorothea Reynolds.&lt;ref name=Cliffedweller1&gt;{{cite web |last=No writer attributed |title='Cliffedweller Dwelling at Kirkland House |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=266229 |date=29 Sep 1950 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson received his Ph.D from Harvard in 1959. Prior to his graduation, he lived in [[Alsace]] and studied in Europe on a scholarship.&lt;ref name=Saxon1/&gt;

==Career==

In 1954, Harvard began to offer students credit and advanced standing for work completed in high school, including [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement (AP)]] courses,&lt;ref name=Wofford2&gt;{{cite web |last= Wofford|first=John G. |title=Hanson States Need for Uniformity In College Exemption Requirements |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=210469 |date=8 Dec 1955 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hanson, then a graduate student was given the task of implementing the new program.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb1&gt;*{{cite web |last= Gottlieb|first=Joshua D. |title=Advanced Standing Option Debuts |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=502738 |date=7 June 2004 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two colleagues, Hanson, started the Office of Advanced Standing at Harvard University,&lt;ref name="Reichard1"/&gt; and as Director of Harvard's Office of Advanced Standing in 1955, Hanson worked to get all academic departments to standardize their award-granting requirements and to align their policies with the standards outlined by the [[College Board|College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB)]].&lt;ref name=Wofford2/&gt; Hanson was a member of the Committee of Examiners for the 1956–1957 [[AP German]] syllabus.&lt;ref name=Reichard1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reichard|first=Joseph R. |title=The College Board and Advanced Placement in German | journal=The German Quarterly | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=220–224 |date=Nov 1956|doi=10.2307/401493|jstor=401493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson quit his position with Harvard's office of Advanced Standing in November 1957 to accept an assistant professorship at [[Williams College]]. By the time Hanson left Harvard, Advanced Standing existed in 174 colleges, and Harvard alone grew from 39 students admitted with advanced standing the first year, to 174 the year Hanson left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bryce E. |title=Director of Advanced Standing Will Quit to Teach at Williams: Wilcox Successor |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=268096 |date=6 Nov 1957 |website= |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained through the mid  1960s at Williams College.&lt;ref name=DiYanni1&gt;{{cite web|last=DiYanni|first=Robert |title=The History of AP Program |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/21502.html |year=2008 |work= CollegeBoard.com|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he translated ''History of the Weimar Republic'' and also translated and edited a German anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Library of Congress Online Catalog |url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;Search_Arg=harlan+hanson&amp;Search_Code=GKEY%5E*&amp;CNT=100&amp;hist=1&amp;type=quick |website= |publisher= |accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also served as Chief Reader for the AP German examinations while at Williams College.&lt;ref name=Harlan1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Harlan P. |title=The View from One Seat in the Boat | journal=The German Quarterly | volume=38 | issue=Membership Issue | pages=427–435 |date=Sep 1965|doi=10.2307/3806697|jstor=3806697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Hanson succeeded Jack Arbolino as Director of the Advanced Placement program for the [[College Board]] and he remained at this position until 1989.&lt;ref name=DiYanni1/&gt;  For 23 of these years, Hanson "administered the program single-handedly, with some secretarial help and advice from the [[Educational Testing Service]],"&lt;ref name=Saxon1/&gt; yet under his leadership the AP program nonetheless "grew exponentially."&lt;ref name=DiYanni1/&gt; By the time he left the post of Director, the number of high schools offering AP courses had increased from 93&lt;ref name=Lohnes1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohnes|first=Walter F.

In the mid-1960s, Hanson was one of the original council members of the International Schools Examinations Syndicate, which later became the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureate Organisation]]. He was instrumental in acquiring funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] for IB and securing university recognition from Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton for the [[IB Diploma Programme]].&lt;ref name = "Mathews"&gt;{{cite book |title=Supertest |last= Mathews|first=Jay |authorlink= |first2=Ian |last2=Hill |year=2005 |publisher=Open Court |location= |isbn=978-0-8126-9577-9  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=D356tnugGYwC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=harpo+hanson|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Peterson1&gt;{{cite book |title=Schools Across Frontiers |last= Peterson|first= A.D.C.|authorlink= |year=2003|edition= 2nd |publisher= Open Court|location= |isbn=978-0-8126-9505-2 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nTUjMNjNo3EC&amp;dq=peterson+international+baccalaureate&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson was also a founding member of the board of International Baccalaureate North America (IBNA).&lt;ref name=Bagnall1&gt;*{{cite journal | last = Bagnall | first = Nigel Fraser | title = The International Baccalaureate in Australia and Canada: 1980–1993 | journal = Ph.D Dissertation |page=52 | date = Sep 1994 | url = http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/817/1/adt-NU20020624.142124whole02.pdf | accessdate = 24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Higher Education Act of 1965''' ('''HEA''') ({{USPL|89|329}}) was legislation signed into [[Law of the United States|United States law]] on November 8, 1965, as part of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] domestic agenda. Johnson chose [[Texas State University]] (then called "[[Texas State University#Name changes|Southwest Texas State College]]"), his [[alma mater]], as the signing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/Johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Johnson signs legislation into law |publisher=LBJ Library and Museum |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714005531/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was intended "to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education". It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans for students, and established a National Teachers Corps.  The "financial assistance for students" is covered in [[Title IV]] of the HEA.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 was reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008. Current authorization for the programs in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of 2013, but has been extended through 2015 while Congress prepares changes and amendments. Before each re-authorization, Congress amends additional programs, changes the language and policies of existing programs, or makes other changes.

== 1965 Act ==
In January 1965, Representative [[Edith Green]] of Oregon introduced H. R. 3220 as a bill to "strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary education."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/higher-education-act|title=Higher Education Act|last=|first=|date=|website=The Great Society Congress|publisher=Association of Centers for the Study of Congress|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Wayne Morse]] of Oregon introduced the Senate version of the bill, S. 600.  The bills sought to create an advisor council to review teacher training programs and to create a [[National Teachers Corps|National Teacher Corps]], which would recruit teachers to serve in low-income areas and train teachers through internships.  Other provisions of the bills included financial aid, scholarships, work study, and library enhancements.  Throughout 1965 numerous hearings were held by Special Subcommittee on Education and the Education Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held numerous hearings.  Based on the recommendations of University administrators, educators and student aid officers, a new bill was introduced:  H. R. 9567.  It was passed by the House of Representatives on August 26 and the Senate passed the bill on September 2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 into law, President Johnson said that the act, along with the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] as "keystones of the great, fabulous 89th Congress" that would spread "the roots of change and reform" throughout the nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Changes in 1998==
The [[Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs]] (GEAR UP) was first authorized under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.  Also in the amendments of 1998 is the Aid Elimination Provision, which prevents students with drug charges from receiving federal aid for colleges and universities.  This is where question 31 on the [[FAFSA]] forms originates. The question asks whether the student has ever been convicted of a [[drug-related crime|drug crime]] while receiving federal financial aid. This statutory provision was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in the face of a constitutional challenge by the [[ACLU]] in the case of ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source | case = ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings'', 523 F.3d 896 (8th cir., 2008) | findlaw = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1386070.html | other_source1 = LexisOne | other_url1 = http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&amp;format=FULL&amp;sourceID=gdjc&amp;searchTerm=eTEf.HLZa.UYGY.Cdfb&amp;searchFlag=y&amp;l1loc=FCLOW | other_source2 = Law.com | other_url2 = http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202421214044&amp;slreturn=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I think this information works better in its own section, because it is not a summary of the article, where it used to be --&gt;

The amendments also included a provision [HEA Section 487(a)(23)] requiring universities to make a good faith effort to encourage voter registration of students on their campuses. This requirement applies only to institutions located in states that require voter registration prior to election day and do not allow registration the day of the election. Institutions receive registration forms from the state after requesting them at least 120 days prior to the voter registration deadline, and must make them "widely available" to students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rit.edu/fa/grms/compliance/statutes/Voter_Registration_Provision_in_Higher_Education_Amendments_of_1998.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in 2003==
&lt;!-- None of the links in these references work!--&gt;In 2003, much of the Higher Education Act was set to expire. As a result, a number of minority groups united to ask for certain changes. Calling themselves the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, this group was made up of "the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]], the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an advocacy group for [[historically black colleges and universities]], [and they] presented their joint recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act."&lt;ref name="burd"&gt;Stephen Burd, "Institutions Serving Minority Students Propose Changes to Higher Education Act," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' 49, no. 26 (2003), http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance aimed to help minority students enter fields where they seemed to be underrepresented and to give incentives to minorities to enter these programs. These incentives included more lenience on loan collection and full government funding for minority education. The Alliance also called for the government to create funding for students in graduate programs of universities serving the minority population.&lt;ref name="burd"/&gt;

Even though the Alliance's request to change the Higher Education Act was heard, significant parts were denied. In 2003, the request for increasing the amount offered in a [[Pell Grant]], to better cover a student's expenses, was denied by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital briefs," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, other issues were corrected. There was a section passed, by the House, that did allow more funds to go to institutions, in order to keep them current; and a grace period for colleges asking for more loans was eliminated. So, if more funding were needed, minority institutions would not have to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Lane, "Bill Would Expand Higher Ed. Access for Minorities, Low-Income Students," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 reauthorization==
{{US student loans}}
With the changes proposed in 2003, the actual Higher Education Act was not reauthorized. Instead, many of its sections were renewed, with little radical change. Numerous extensions have followed, with the most recent extension lasting through August 15, 2008. The Senate passed an HEA reauthorization bill in July 2007, as did the House of Representatives in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strong Step for Students: House Higher Education Bill Promotes Innovation and Student Success|publisher=[[Center for Law and Social Policy]]|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0401.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2008, the [[Higher Education Opportunity Act]] (Public Law 110-315) (HEOA) was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Expands Basic Aid and Supports Innovation in Student Success, Basic Skills, and Workforce Partnerships|publisher=Center for Law and Social Policy|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0430.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reauthorized the amended version of the Higher Education Act of 1965.&lt;ref name="ED.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act - 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act made major changes in student loan discharges for disabled people. Previously, to qualify for a discharge, a disabled person could have no income. This has been changed to a no "substantial gainful activity" test, which is the same standard used by the [[Social Security Administration]] in determining eligibility for [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI). The changes took effect on July 1, 2010.

Also included in the 2008 revision of the HEOA were provisions requiring action by U.S. colleges and universities to combat illegal file sharing.&lt;ref name="Educause.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/higher-education-opportunity-act-heoa|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act Anti-P2P provisions - 2008|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following significant lobbying by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the additions to the HEOA of 2008 included requirements that all U.S. colleges and universities (1) release and annual disclosure to students regarding copyright laws and associated campus policies, (2) a written plan, submitted to the Department of Education, to combat copyright abuse using one or more technology-based deterrents, and (3) an offer to students of alternatives to illegal downloading.&lt;ref name="Law Offices of Zick Rubin Memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EPO0938.pdf|title=Dealing With the Higher Education Opportunity Act's New Copyright Protection Requirement|publisher=Law Offices of Zick Rubin|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant controversy surrounded the inclusion of anti-P2P legislation into HEOA of 2008, resulting in a letter from a number of leaders in higher education.&lt;ref name="Opposing Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/CSD5226.pdf|title=Letter Opposing The Inclusion Of The Entertainment Industry Proposal On Illegal File Sharing In The HEA Sent By The Higher Education Members Of The Joint Committee|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[College Cost Reduction and Access Act]] (CCRA), a budget reconciliation bill signed into law in September 2007, made significant changes to federal financial aid programs included in HEA. In addition to increasing the maximum [[Pell Grant]] award and reducing interest rates on subsidized student loans, this bill capped loan repayment at 15% of an individual’s [[discretionary income]], raised the income protection allowance, enacted loan forgiveness for public servants in the Direct Loan program, set publicly funded student loans to fixed rates from variable rate loans, and took actions to address problematic practices in the lending industry. Most CCRA provisions took effect on October 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association of University Women]]. ''Increasing Access to Higher Education''. January 2008. [http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law for the first time also required post-secondary institutions be more transparent about costs and required the nearly 7,000 post-secondary institutions that receive federal financial aid funds (Title IV) to post net price calculators on their websites as well as security and copyright policies by October 29, 2011.

As defined in HEOA, the net price calculator's purpose is "to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The [net price] calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student’s individual net price at a particular institution."

The law defines "estimated net price" as the difference between an institution's average total Price of Attendance (the sum of tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses including personal expenses and transportation for a first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive aid) and the institution's median need- and merit-based grant aid awarded.

Elise Miller, program director for the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] ([[IPEDS]]), stated the idea behind the requirement: "We just want to break down the myth of sticker price and get beyond it. This is to give students some indication that they will not [necessarily] be paying that full price."&lt;ref&gt;U''niversity Business: Preparing for the Net Price Calculator: Avoid Potential Pitfalls by Taking These Steps Today'' By Haley Chitty, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The template was developed based on the suggestions of the IPEDS' Technical Review Panel (TRP), which met on January 27–28, 2009, and included 58 individuals representing federal and state governments, post-secondary institutions from all sectors, association representatives, and template contractors. Mary Sapp, assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami, served as the panel's chair. She described the mandate's goal "to provide prospective and current undergraduate students with some insight into the difference between an institution's sticker price and the price they will end up paying".

The TRP faced the difficult challenge of creating one tool that could be used by a wide variety of institutions – from small, for-profit career schools to major research universities – while balancing simplicity for users.

To meet the requirement, post-secondary institutions may choose either a basic template developed by the U.S. Department of Education or an alternate net price calculator that offers at least the minimum elements required by law.

As part of its cost-transparency measures, HEOA of 2008 requires also on the College Navigator Web site a report giving the average institutional net price of attendance for first-time, full-time students who receive financial aid. This also forms the basis for transparency lists; a report on the College Navigator Web site the institutional net price of attendance for Title IV aid recipients by income categories; and for the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to develop a multi-year tuition and required-fees calculator for undergraduate programs for the College Navigator Web site.

The HEA has been criticized for establishing statutory pricing of federal student loans based on political considerations rather than pricing based on risk.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act also maintained the requirement that universities must make an effort to register students to vote. A 2013 Dear Colleague letter from the U.S. Department of Education stated that universities “must make the voter registration forms widely available to [their] students and distribute the forms individually to [their] degree or certificate program students who are physically in attendance at [their] institution. Distribution by regular or electronic mail is permitted.”&lt;ref&gt;https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1317.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title VI==

During this reform period of 2008, Title VI of the HEA was reviewed.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"&gt;Hegji, Alexandra. 2014. The Higher Education Act (HEA): A Primer. Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title VI provides federal funds to 129 international studies and foreign language centers at universities nationwide.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"&gt;Brandeis Center 2014- http://brandeiscenter.com/publications/research_opinion_full/joint_statement_on_the_misuse_of_federal_funds_under_title_vi&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this act is to ensure and encourage diverse perspectives in order to enhance national security. As such, Title VI supplies grants for international language studies, business and international education programs as well as international policy.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"/&gt; Moreover, the recipients of these funds are required to engage in ‘public outreach’ for K-12, teachers, educators and the general public.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"/&gt;

Over the past decade concerns have been raised over these title VI funded programs. Conservative critics have emphasized that many of the international programs funded engage in biased, anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric, with no offers of counterbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Kurtz 2007- the national review -taking sides on title VI- http://www.nationalreview.com/article/223078/taking-sides-title-vi-stanley-kurtz&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, a 2006 review mandated by Congress found that the programs were not reaching their goals. Seeking to rectify this, Congress expressed the need for greater oversight by the Department of Education, as well as an investigation to ensure these programs reflected "diverse perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;U.S Department of Education- http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, the issues within Title VI have been deemed endemic. Writing in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', [[Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law|Louis D. Brandeis Center]] Founder [[Kenneth L. Marcus]] argued that "title VI doesn’t need to be tweaked-it needs to be overhauled".&lt;ref name="The Hill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/218110-title-vi-and-campus-bias | title=Title VI and campus bias | work=The Hill | date=September 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017 | author=[[Marcus, Kenneth L.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration followed a joint statement released by 10 groups on September 17, 2014, which the Brandeis Center coordinated.

This joint statement expressed the deep concerns over the misuse of tax payer money, arguing that "these outreach programs, which have no congressional oversight, often disseminate anti-American and anti-Israel falsehoods."&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;Peter Schmidt, 2014, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/supporters-of-israel-say-programs-in-middle-east-studies-misuse-u-s-funds/86245 Supporters of Israel Say Programs in Middle East Studies Misuse U.S. Funds]
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the groups voiced the opinion that " too often exclude scholars with diverse perspectives while stifling discourse on critical issues. The biased learning environment that results suppresses the academic freedom of students and faculty with different views. At some institutions, students are afraid to disagree with their professors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/news/jointstatement.pdf Joint Statement on the Misuse of Federal Funds Under Title VI, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This statement was accompanied by a white paper published by the Brandeis Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/practices/antisemitism_whitepaper.pdf | title=The Morass of Middle East Studies: Title VI of the Higher Education Act and Federally Funded Area Studies (Rev. Ed.) | publisher=Louis D. Brandeis Center | date=November 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a report by the [[AMCHA Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CNES-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the negative effects this biased perspective produces on campuses, UCLA specifically.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;Inside Higher ED- Pro-Israel Groups Question Federal Funds for Middle East Centers https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/18/pro-israel-groups-question-federal-funds-middle-east-centers&lt;/ref&gt; The AMCHA study found that "any time UCLA’s center sponsored or co-sponsored an event mentioning Israel from Fall 2010 to Spring 2013, 93% of the time the mention was negative and critical – as if Israel is a blight on the planet."&lt;ref name="The Hill"/&gt;

UCLA's media relations office issued a statement saying that the university "remains dedicated to complying with all federal laws and respecting the free and open exchange of ideas representing diverse viewpoints." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In light of such issues, the joint statement calls for changes in the Title VI program which would 1) "[r]equire recipients of Title VI funds to establish grievance procedures to address complaints that programs are not reflecting diverse perspectives and a wide range of views" and 2) "[r]equire the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to establish a formal complaint-resolution process similar to that in use to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

Responding to this statement Amy W. Newhall, executive director of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA), asserted that MESA "resolutely opposes all forms of hate speech and discrimination, including anti-Semitism," but "is concerned that some of the reports issued by partisan political groups based outside academia may actually weaken efforts to combat anti-Semitism by portraying all criticism of Israeli policies as a form of anti-Semitism or as ‘anti-Israel.’" &lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;

However, as Kenneth L. Marcus asserts in a letter to the editor of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' the co-signatories of the joint statement " urge the opposite: accountability systems to ensure that these programs offer the diversity of perspectives that existing law requires."&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/blogs/letters/our-goal-is-not-to-shut-down-open-discussion/&lt;/ref&gt;
As said statement concludes: "Arguably, Title VI programs no longer serve a legitimate purpose...  In 2011, Congress reduced Title VI funding nationwide by 40 percent, from $34 million to $18 million.  Unless effective and necessary reforms can be enacted, Congress may have to consider reducing or eliminating Title VI funding from Middle East studies centers." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Extension of HEA==
After being reauthorized in 2008, the Higher Education Act was set to expire in 2013, but was re-extended to allow Congress time to work on the next reauthorization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acenet.edu/advocacy/Pages/Higher-Education-Act.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, House Republicans announced that they had finalized an overhaul of the act, authored primarily by Representative Virginia Foxx of (R - N.C.), the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The new bill is called the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act. The act aims to simplify the federal financial aid process and expand federal work study programs. It would also repeal two Obama-era programs -  “gainful employment” and “borrower defense” - aimed at preventing financial exploitation of undergraduates, as well as bar their readoption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/house-republican-higher-education-bill-obama.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Committee spokesman Michael Woeste, “the reforms within the PROSPER Act are necessary to provide students with a high-quality education, and fix a system that has not been serving their needs.”&lt;ref&gt; https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/07/cbo-estimates-show-house-higher-ed-bill-could-hit-student-loan-borrowers-hard/?utm_term=.7595e5ca5cba &lt;/ref&gt;

Some concerns have been raised by advocacy groups about how the PROSPER Act would affect LGBTQ students. According to the Human Rights Campaign, “The PROSPER Act contains several provisions that would allow for the use of religion to justify otherwise prohibited discrimination that could negatively impact LGBTQ students.”&lt;ref&gt;http://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/media/press-releases/the-prosper-act-what-people-are-really-saying-continued_&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the PROSPER Act includes a weaker version of the provision requiring universities to increase student voter registration, a requirement present in the Higher Education Act since 1998. Critics worry that this change will lead to lower youth turnout in elections, as voter turnout is already historically lowest among young voters.

'''Howard Richards''' (born June 10, 1938) is a [[philosophy|philosopher]] of [[Social Science]] who works with the concepts of ''basic cultural structures''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Richards [http://www.howardri.org/Let60.html What the World Needs Now]. Cultural action to transform the basic structures of the modern world is a general concept that unites most of Richards' writing - see: Richards (2014): [http://unboundedorganization.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chapter-One-Rosario.pdf Unbounded Organization] p. 1 and 8. ''Methods for Transforming the  Structures of the Modern World'' is the subtitle of Vol.II of {{harvnb|Richards|1994}}  ''Letters from Quebec''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''constitutive rules''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;
Constitutive rule, a key concept rooted in the work of [[John Searle]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and in Richards' Oxford tutor [[Rom Harré]]'s rules-oriented approach to the explanation of social behavior. One can find a good description of what Prof Richards understands by ''Constitutive Rules'' in his 2010 speech at the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA)  [http://howardrichards.org/peace4us/humanizing-methodologies-in-transformation/ Humanizing Methodologies in Transformation].&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the title of Research Professor of Philosophy at [[Earlham College]], a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]], United States, the Quaker School where he taught for thirty years. He officially retired from Earlham College, together with his wife Caroline Higgins in 2007, but retained the title of Research Professor of Philosophy. He has a PhD in Philosophy from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1974}} (Santa Barbara PhD Dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from the [[Stanford Law School]], an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) from [[Oxford University]] (UK) and a PhD in Educational Planning &lt;ref&gt;With a first field in Curriculum Planning and a second field in [[Applied Psychology]] and [[Moral Education]] with a doctoral thesis on the Chilean PPH (Parents and Children) Project, published as "''The Evaluation of Cultural Action''" ({{harvnb|Richards|1984}}).&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] (OISE), [[University of Toronto]], Canada. He now teaches at the [[University of Santiago, Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;On the doctoral program in [[Management Science]] and the undergraduate program in Ingeneria Comercial (Economics).&lt;/ref&gt; and has ongoing roles at the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) &lt;ref&gt;

He is founder of the Peace and Global Studies Program&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The name of the Program has varied over the years from Peace Studies to Peace and Conflict Studies and then, continuing until now, Peace and Global Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of the Business and Nonprofit Management Program at Earlham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascalobservatory.org/users/howard-richards Howard Richards] profile.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Howard Richards was born in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. [[California]], United States, the eldest child of Kenneth F. Richards, a truck mechanic, originally from [[Connecticut]], and his wife Donna.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;(McCune)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his mother's intellectual interest in philosophers such as [[Henri Bergson]] which prompted the family to break its ties with [[mormon]]ism. His paternal grandparents fell into unemployment in Connecticut during the [[Great Depression]] and moved to Pasadena in 1932. It was his uncle Jack from his mother's side, who died during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;p 257 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=howard+richards+uncle+Jack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b12zT_qO9A&amp;sig=1WNK9Bn5ot8Sft8kvdofeKXL80&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIx8Kol5GyxwIVCTnbCh3KMgfV#v=onepage&amp;q=howard%20richards%20uncle%20Jack&amp;f=false Understanding the Global Economy] and under "The Holocaust" in [http://www.howardri.org/logicalpeaceplan.html Richards], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially his mother who fostered his early intellectual interest.&lt;ref&gt;see eg [http://lists.topica.com/lists/CERJ/read/message.html?sort=d&amp;mid=1721114650&amp;start=0 TOPICA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==
After graduating from [[Redlands High School]], CA, in June 1956, Richards enrolled in the same year as a Philosophy undergraduate at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Being a top student, he was allowed to skip one year of the normal three year Major in Philosophy course. Afterwards he was admitted  to [[Stanford Law School]] in 1958, graduating with a Juris Doctor ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) degree in 1961. Later in that year he enrolled in graduate school at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], earning an M.A. in Philosophy there in 1964 with a thesis on [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1963}} (MA Philosophy Thesis).&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously he worked at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]] think tank where he contributed several articles to the in-house Center Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;a.o. an article entitled  "A normative Economics" - see [http://www.howardri.org/Bib.html Richards Bibliography] Articles.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 he left for Chile, where they ultimately would settle in the town of [[Limache]]. Soon after their arrival, Howard took up the post of Dean of Studies at the [[Santiago College]], (a college in Chile is a secondary school). While in [[Santiago]], Howard joined the Chilean Ministry of Education as an advisor to President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]]'s Educational Reform, working on a Secondary Curriculum influenced by the ideas of the Brazilian Educator [[Paulo Freire]]&lt;ref&gt;CPEIP-MINEDUC -  Centro de Perfeccionamiento, Experimentación e Investigaciones Pedagógicas. Ministerio de la Educación.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1970 Richards and his family left for the UK where Richards enrolled for an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) at [[Oxford University]], simultaneously doing one on one tutorials and attending seminars by the philosophers [[Rom Harré]] and [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref&gt;See eg [https://books.google.com/books?id=c14UNW298sAC&amp;pg=PA438&amp;lpg=PA438&amp;dq=howard+richards+rom+harre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmbiSC7QsD&amp;sig=fjosYk8zOkT4JROztTd4-cl2LYU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9qqiVabWHa3d7QacvYOADA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=howard%20richards%20rom%20harre&amp;f=false Harré], who had a strong influence on Richards' thinking.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an honors thesis on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;"''The Concept of Causality in the Light of Piaget's Research on the Scientific Thinking of Children''" Thesis, Oxford University, 1973. Translated as Richards, 1974 ''El Desarollo Intelectual del Niño'' (see eg: [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000281/028108eo.pdf Prospects UNESCO 1977] Vol. VII No. 4. p 557).&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Chile in 1972, now under president [[Salvador Allende]], he continued to work with Freire's ideas at CIDE (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo de la Educación - Educational Research and Development Center) where he founded the Parents and Children Program (Programa Padres e Hijos - PHH), a Community Development combined with a Parent Education program.&lt;ref name="RichardsEs"&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1982}} Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RichardsEn"&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1984}} English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED376920.pdf Howard Richards and Loren Pierce], 1993 "Cooperative, Community-based Evaluation of Preschool Programs".

Richards and his family left Chile in 1974, after [[Pinochet]]'s 1973 [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]], but not before having helped friends and colleagues escape Pinochet's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] police.&lt;ref&gt;As described in [http://www.biblio.com/sweet-country-by-richards-caroline/work/378047  Sweet Country], a book authored by Howard's wife Caroline and which was later (1987) turned into a [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/23/movies/film-sweet-country.html film of the same name]  (re: ''[[Sweet Country (1987 film)|Sweet Country]]'') by the Greek director [[Michael Cacoyannis]].&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy curriculum Richards had helped develop was repealed shortly after the coup, but was adopted in several other Latin American countries. In September 1974 Richards and his family returned to the USA where he started work at [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], [[Indiana]]. Later that year he successfully defended his doctoral thesis in Philosophy at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], having done the preparatory work when still in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1974}}  ''Distributive Justice'' Doctoral Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; While based in Richmond, he attended the [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] Summer School on Moral Education at [[Harvard University]]. Richards became a professor at Earlham College and was the founding director of its [http://www.earlham.edu/peace-and-global-studies/the-program/ Peace and Global Studies] program until 1989 and part-time Director until 2004. Between 1981 and 1985, Richards combined commitments in Richmond with those at [http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/Home/ OISE, Toronto], with the occasional stay in [[Quebec]] where their daughters were studying at a French-speaking school, he enrolled in another PhD program in Education, with a first field in curriculum planning and a second field in [[applied psychology]] and moral education, at the [[University of Toronto]]'s Institute for Studies in Education (UT/OISE), which he successfully completed with a doctoral thesis based on the Chilean PPH program.&lt;ref&gt;This OISE thesis was published as {{harvnb|Richards|1982}} and translated into English as {{harvnb|Richards|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Beatrice"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0738059385900124|title= The Evaluation of Cultural Action|first=Beatrice|last=Avalos|year=1985|publisher= Int.

==Law practice==
Richards was the first volunteer attorney for [[Cesar Chavez]]'s [[United Farm Workers of America]], protecting the union's funds against grower lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Journal Labor"/&gt;   In 1983 he became member of the American Bankruptcy Institute.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1989 he  started practicing law in Santa Barbara, joining the [http://www.lafsbc.org/ Legal Aid Foundation] and specializing in bankruptcy,&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.nacba.org/ National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys](NACBA).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he also was a voluntary attorney at the [http://www.lafla.org/ Los Angeles Free Clinic],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justia.com/lawyers/california/goleta?page=2 Justicia] members.&lt;/ref&gt; a practice he wound up in 2004, when he moved back to [[Limache]], Chile.

==Major works and ideas==
* In his first major work, ''The Evaluation of Cultural Action'' (1984),&lt;ref name="RichardsEs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RichardsEn"/&gt; Richards ''"unveils throughout the text the rationale for using an 'illuminative' approach (Parlett and Hamilton, 1974) rather than a conventional 'systems' assessment"''.&lt;ref name="Beatrice"/&gt; The long dialogue with a "reasonable social scientist" gravitates around how to evaluate education and community development efforts inspired by the Brazilian adult educationist [[Paulo Freire]]'s philosophy, combined with an empirical study of one such effort, namely PPH (Parents and Children Program) that flourished among peasants in the south of Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
* Richards' two-volume ''Letters from Quebec: a Philosophy for Peace and Justice'' (1994)  &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1994}}, Bloomberg books, also published by [http://www.gamutbooks.org/cf71y_letters-from-quebec-a-philosophy-for-peace-and-justice-pdf.pdf International Scholars Press, 1996]. ''Letters from Quebec Vol 1 &amp; 2'' can be read online on [https://www.scribd.com/doc/184024951/Howard-Richards-Letters-From-Quebec-vols-1-2-pdf#scribd Scribd].&lt;/ref&gt; aspires to be both literary entertainment and a history of [[rationality]] in western culture and philosophy, illuminating the possibilities for transformative and humanistic action. The subtitle of volume Two of ''Letters from Quebec'' is  'Methods for Transforming the  Structures of the Modern World'. Taking leads from [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], the philosopher is seen - borrowing a phrase from [[Paulo Freire]] - as a 'cultural activist' who invents rationalities.
*  Building on the premise that standards of [[rationality]] are historically [[social construct|constructed]] social norms, he went on, in ''Understanding the Global Economy'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|2004}} (Peace Education Books) was originally published by [https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_the_global_economy.html?id=8yQPAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Maadhyam] in 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that causal explanations in economics invariably rely, as premises, on cultural norms, and particularly on constitutive rules &lt;ref&gt;"Constitutive rules constitute (and also regulate) an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules." [http://howardrichards.org/peace4us/humanizing-methodologies-in-transformation/ Richards, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; Richards proposes to understand institutions by following out the consequences of the rules that organize them.

The '''''Incheon declaration''''' is a declaration on education adopted at the [[World Education Forum]] in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]] on 15 May 2015. It is the logical continuation of the [[Education For All]] (EFA) movement and the  [[Millennium Development Goals]] on Education, and many of its goals were based on a review of progress made since the 2000 World Education Forum in [[Dakar]].

== Declaration Content ==

=== Equality and Access ===
In keeping with its overall goal of ensuring education for all, the Incheon Declaration emphasizes several different types of equality. In addition, emphasis is placed on ensuring that cost and discrimination do not prevent people from pursuing and receiving quality education. Gender equality is specifically mentioned as an important aspect of an educational system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1686213805/5AB26A579C4448F0PQ/5?accountid=9783|title=The Incheon Declaration|last=Inayatullah|first=|date=June 6, 2015|work=The Nation [Lahore, Pakistan]|access-date=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improvement of Outcomes ===
The signatories of the Incheon Declaration also agreed to make improvements in educational outcomes, including especially increased rates of functional literacy. Outcome goals also include having developed countries reaching 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) for official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries.&lt;ref name="IISD" /&gt;

=== Funding ===
Another key recommendation contained in the Incheon Declaration regards funding for education. The signatories are urged to commit 4-6% of their [[Gross domestic product]] or 15-20% of their public expenditures to improving the status of education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Education 2030: A new vision for education ==
The Education 2030 Framework for Action, adopted at Incheon in May 2015, recognises [[lifelong learning]] for all as one of the underpinning principles of this new vision, stating that “all age groups, including adults, should have opportunities to learn and continue learning.” Those who signed onto the declaration committed to provide twelve years of primary and secondary education paid for by the public. Further, nine of those years will be compulsory.&lt;ref name="IISD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Delia|title=World Education Forum 2015 Adopts Incheon Declaration on Education for All by 2030|url=http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-education-forum-2015-adopts-incheon-declaration-on-education-for-all-by-2030/|website=IISD|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also calls on countries to “develop policies and programmes for the provision of quality [[Distance education|distance learning]] in tertiary education, with appropriate financing and use of technology, including the Internet, [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) and other modalities that meet accepted quality standards to improve access.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Data Visualization}}
'''Information design''' is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters efficient and effective understanding of it. The term has come to be used specifically for [[graphic design]] for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of [[data visualization]] and is often taught as part of graphic design courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.design.ccsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup,  Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'information design' emerged as a [[interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] area of study in the 1970s. Some [[graphic designer]]s started to use the term, and it was consolidated with the publication of the ''Information Design Journal'' in 1979, and later with the setting up of the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) in 1987 and  [[Information Design Association]] (IDA) in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robwaller.org/IDA_origins_RW.pdf |title=The Origins of the Information Design Association |publisher=University of Reading |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, [[Edward Tufte]] produced a book on information design called ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''.
The term [[information graphics]] tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information.

In [[technical communication]], information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practiced on different scales.
* On a large scale, it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose.
* On a medium scale, it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews, concepts, examples, references, and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle.
* On a fine scale, it includes logical development of topics, emphasis on what's important, clear writing, navigational clues, and even page design, choice of font, and use of white space.
Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing [[web site]]s, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.
In [[computer science]] and [[information technology]], 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as) [[information architecture]], the design of [[information system]]s, [[database]]s, or [[data structure]]s.  This sense includes [[data modeling]] and [[process analysis]].
{{Citation needed span|text=In the United States, the title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites.|date=April 2018|reason=}} The skill set of the information designer, as the title is applied more globally, is closer to that of the [[information architecture|information architect]] in the U.S.

==Early examples==
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|350px|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram of [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's March]] - an early example of an information graphic.]]
Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:
* [[William Playfair]]'s [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[pie chart|pie]], and [[area chart]]s illustrating England's trade (1786 and 1801)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/12/23/first-area-charts-history/ |title=First Ever Area Charts Created 200+ Years Ago |publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tufte&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Tufte|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|ISBN=0961392142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s spot maps, which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in 1850s London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosier|first1=Scott|title=John Snow: The London Cholera Epidemic of 1854|url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/science/science_reading/8.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Charles Joseph Minard: Mapping Napoleon's March, 1861|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/58|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|International Picture Language]] of the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popova|first=Maria|title=The Invention of ISOTYPE: How a Vintage Visual Language Paved the Way for the Infographics Age|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/03/08/the-transformer-isotype/|publisher=Brain Pickings|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Nightingale]]'s information graphic depicting army mortality rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Hugh|title=Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams|url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812-1813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  [[Edward Tufte]] wrote in 1983 that: "It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn."&lt;ref name=Tufte /&gt;

Information design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Design FAQ|url=http://www.bogieland.com/infodesign_faq.htm|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies).

Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the [[Truth in Lending Act]] in the USA, which introduced the [[Schumer box]] (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).

Professor [[Edward Tufte]] explained that users of information displays are executing particular ''analytical tasks''  such as making comparisons or determining causality. The ''design principle'' of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Y4SxgfGCg Edward Tufte-Presentation-August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplicity ==
Simplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more
information means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design: 1. Tell the truth, 2. Get to the point, 3. Pick the right tool for the job, 4. Highlight what is important, 5. Of course, keep it simple. These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged. &lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Nancy.

'''Instructional animations''' are [[animation]]s that are used either to provide instructions for immediate performance of a task or to support more permanent [[education|learning]] of subject matter. While both of these uses can be described as instructional animations, when the goal is to support learning, the term [[educational animation]] may be preferred.

The '''Leonard Law''' is a [[California law]] passed in 1992 and amended in 2006 that applies the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] to [[private school|private]] and [[public university|public]] [[college]]s, high schools, and [[university|universities]]. The law also applies Article I, Section 2 of the [[California Constitution]] to colleges and universities. California is the only state to grant First Amendment protections to students at private postsecondary institutions. Attempts at a [[federal government of the United States|federal]] Leonard Law and for Leonard Laws in other states have not succeeded.

==About==
[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[California State Senate|State Senator]] [[Bill Leonard (politician)|Bill Leonard]] wrote the law to require private high schools, colleges and universities to protect their students' rights to [[freedom of speech]] "and other [[communication]]" that the [[government]] is required to protect for all of its [[citizen]]s. Under the terms of the law, students may file [[civil law (common law)|civil]] [[lawsuit]]s to seek [[injunction|injunctive]] and [[declaratory relief]] against their institutions; students may also recover any [[attorney's fee]]s related to the case.

In 2006, California amended the law to include public institutions of higher education, which in California consist of the [[California Community Colleges System]], the [[California State University]] system, and the [[University of California]] system. State Assembly members [[Leland Yee]] and [[Joe Nation]] authored the amendment in preemptive response to the ''[[Hosty v. Carter]]'' decision of the federal [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The amendment came into force in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/calif-expands-freedoms-for-college-press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/legalresearch.asp?subcat=4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
On May 2, 1994, [[Stanford Law School]] student Robert J. Corry and eight other [[Stanford University]] students filed the first lawsuit under the Leonard Law, claiming that Stanford's [[speech code]] violated the law. On February 27, 1995, [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[Superior Court]] Judge Peter G. Stone issued the ruling in ''[[Corry v. Stanford]]'' that struck down the speech code as a violation of the Leonard Law.

This is a '''list of education practices''' which have been replaced by or abandoned in favor of newer (or older) practices. To maintain a balanced point of view, each example should provide a source showing that the practice was abandoned or replaced. A practice abandoned by one school, for example [[reform mathematics]], may still be in adoption by other schools, so opposing methods may both appear on this list at different times or locations.

* [[One-room school]]s: The advent of [[school bus]]es and better transportation led to consolidating schools into larger buildings in the early 20th century. Such schools are now rare in developed countries.

* [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]: this 1957 regularization of standard English spelling was intended to permit exception-free learning of the rules, yet was strongly reminiscent of traditional spelling, and was intended to allow easy transition to the latter. The extra letters in fact had the opposite effect of confusing young readers, and by the 1960s, the issue of distinguishing the multiple sounds assigned to one letter was addressed with other methods such as [[Words in Colour]] and [[diacritical mark]]s.

'''''Lottovoittaja UKK Turhapuro''''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] 1976 comedy film written by [[Spede Pasanen]] and directed by [[Ere Kokkonen]]. It is the third film in the [[Uuno Turhapuro]] series. The film's title translates to "Lottery winner UKK Turhapuro", UKK being an apparent reference to former President of Finland [[Urho Kekkonen]].

==Plot==

It is the first anniversary of Uuno ([[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]) and Elisabet ([[Marjatta Raita]]). Uuno has placed a bet with his friend Härski-Hartikainen ([[Spede Pasanen]]) a year ago, that if Uuno can take just one year of marriage with Elisabet, Hartikainen will treat him a festive dinner. However, Hartikainen buys a lottery ticket for Uuno, who agrees to deduct it from his debt &amp;ndash; and the festive dinner is reduced to a can of milk and half a sausage. As it happens, Uuno becomes the lottery winner of 1.5 million [[Finnish mark|marks]], only to soon realize he doesn't own a single penny yet. Mister Tossavainen ([[Seppo Laine]]) arrives and offers to finance Uuno before he actually gets the jackpot. Thus, Uuno gets to live a rich live on credit. He buys a raccoon fur, leopard swimming trunks and a couple of [[Mercedes-Benz]]es. Women begin to fancy Uuno and so does his [[Councillor Tuura|father-in-law]] ([[Tapio Hämäläinen]]). As time goes by it is revealed, though, that Uuno is not actually a lottery winner, and so he has to escape the anger of others to Härski's car repair shop.

'''Movement in learning''' or movement-based instruction is a [[teaching method]] based on the concept that humans learn better through [[:wikt:movement|movement]]. This teaching method can be applied to students, who should have the opportunity throughout a class period to move around to take "brain breaks" to refocus their attention so they can learn new material. Brain research suggests that physical activity prior to class (in PE for example) and during class, increases students' ability to process and retain new material. This is a new and controversial development in education, and, to date, has little research and empirical data to support this trend.  However, anecdotal evidence regarding the benefits of incorporating movement in the classroom is promising. 

== Benefits ==
Physical movement stimulates long-term memory and recall  because it has been associated in the human brain with survival and this is supported by [[Neuroimaging|brain imaging]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How the Brain Influences Behavior: Strategies for Managing K 12 Classrooms|last=Sousa|first=David|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781632206848|location=Delaware|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by findings such as the studies that show exercise shapes muscles along with the strengthening of some areas of the brain, growing brain cells and increases alertness in the process. It is said that the harder the task is for students, the greater the [[Cerebellum|cerebellar]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivry|first=Richard|date=1997|title=Cerebral Timing Systems|url=|journal=International Review of Neurobiology|volume=41|pages=555-573|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, short movement breaks for the brain is said to lead to more opportunities for information processing and increased [[Memory|memory formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brain-Compatible Science|last=Mangan|first=Margaret|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781632209658|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contributes to the overall [[cognitive development]] of the students because it sends [[oxygen]], water, and [[glucose]] to the brain, helping it grow and improve mood and motivation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refocus and Recharge! 50 Brain Breaks for Middle Schoolers|last=Responsive Classroom|first=|publisher=Center for Responsive Schools, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=9781892989871|location=Turner Falls, MA|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the area of the brain that processes movement is also the part that processes cognitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth to Big School|last=Kearns|first=Karen|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=9780170369343|location=Sydney|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between movement and the cognitive development has been proven as early as the 1960s during [[Richard Held]] and Alan Hein's experiments that revealed the role of physical activity on the development of brain networks that are important for adaptive mental function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Children's Cognition With Physical Activity Games|last=Tomporowski|first=Phillip|last2=McCullick|first2=Bryan|last3=Pesce|first3=Catherine|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2015|isbn=9781450441421|location=Champaign, IL|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students through brain breaks to engage in physical activities can facilitate physical development. In combination with the socialization, which also contributes to the learners' [[Socioemotional adaptation theory|socio-emotional]] development - movements offer a quick and convenient way to support the rapid development, especially among young learners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be demonstrated in the efficacy of using physical tasks to address the needs of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|hyperactive]] students because they release stress and energy, allowing them to focus on their studies without causing disruption in the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Win-Win Classroom: A Fresh and Positive Look at Classroom Management|last=Bluestein|first=Jane|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2008|isbn=9781412958998|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movements also eliminate [[lethargy]] that results from sitting for long periods of time. There are recorded cases, for instance, that show marked improvement in school performance for learners who were made to do physical tasks such as [[walking]] in mid-afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Minds of Boys: Saving Our Sons From Falling Behind in School and Life|last=Gurian|first=Michael|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2005|isbn=9780787977610|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Applications in the classroom==
Ideally students should be getting physical activity before they try to learn new material.  However, if it is not possible for students to have physical activity before a lecture, there are many ways to get students out of their seats and moving during a class period. Students can get out of their seats to turn an assignment in or to pick up a handout. You could have students stand up to share their answers to questions posed by the teacher. After they have shared their answers with each other they may sit down. If students are acting tired and drowsy a teacher could give students a quick break to stand up and stretch. Once they get out of their seats and move around for a bit they will act more alert. Students that struggle to stay focused or are seen as disruptive can benefit greatly from movement in the classroom.

Younger students can benefit from a variety of activities that get them moving and also reinforce what they are learning. Brain based learning supports the use of movement in learning. According to the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, a core principal of brain-based learning states, "Learning engages the whole body. All learning is mind-body: movement, foods, attention cycles, and chemicals modulate learning." Another core principal states, "Complex learning is enhanced by challenge and inhibited by stress. Another state,"Enrichment: The brain can grow new connections at any age. Challenging, complex experiences with appropriate feedback are best. Cognitive skills develop better with music and motor skills. (Dï Arcangelo)" The U.S. National Institute of Health as well as the Mayo Clinic list exercise and movement as a way to decrease stress levels. Elementary aged children can only absorb 15 to 20 minutes worth of material at a time. Taking brain breaks is a win-win situation. Students can learn during these brain breaks plus return to a task renewed and energized.

===Additional benefits for special-needs learners===
Many special-needs learners are stuck in counterproductive mental states, and movement is a quick way to change them, movements, such as those involved in playing active games, will activate the brain across a wide variety of areas. A study by Reynolds and colleagues (2003) found that children with dyslexia were helped by a movement program. Those in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in dexterity, reading, verbal fluency, and semantic fluency than did the control group. The exercising group also made substantial gains on national standardized tests of reading, writing, and comprehension in comparison with students in the previous year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">The '''National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools''' ('''NCBCPS''') is a [[social conservatism in the United States|conservative]] nonprofit organization that promotes the use of its 300-page [[Bible]] curriculum, ''The Bible in History and Literature'', in schools throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="WilsonSilk2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Charles Reagan|last2=Silk|first2=Mark|title=Religion and Public Life in the South: In the Evangelical Mode|date=1 January 2005|publisher=AltaMira Press|language=English |isbn=9780759106345|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCBCPS was founded in 1993,&lt;ref name="WilsonSilk2005"/&gt; and as of 2000 its curriculum has been in use in at least 70 public school districts across the United States.&lt;ref name="USCCR2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rights|first=United States Commission on Civil|title=Schools and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv_OhVf4ockC|accessdate=25 May 2018|year=2000|publisher=[[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]|language=English |page=19|quote=Mr. Eidsmoe serves as legal counsel to the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools, a nationwide, nonprofit organization based in North Carolina whose curriculum has been adopted by 70 different school districts and 25 States all over the country, including Alaska and California.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been criticized by separationists as presenting a religious interpretation of the Bible as well as an unbalanced view of American history which promotes specific religious beliefs. The use of the curriculum has been challenged in lawsuits in two school districts, which have withdrawn the course as contravening the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=ACLU/&gt;

==Overview==
NCBCPS was founded on April 8, 1993, by Elizabeth Ridenhour, a [[Greensboro, NC]], paralegal. The organization's annual [[Tax forms in the United States#990|990 tax forms]], available on [[Guidestar]].org, list Ridenhour as an ordained minister.

According to the organization's Web site, "312 U.S. school districts in 37 states have educated 175,000 of their students using the Bible curriculum as a public high school elective."

A 2006 report, "Reading, Writing and Religion: Teaching the Bible in Texas Public Schools," by Bible scholar Dr. Mark Chancey of Southern Methodist University found that in [[Texas]], "the number of Texas school districts using the NCBCPS curriculum, 11, is less than a fourth of the 52 claimed by the NCBCPS itself. Adding the very few school districts known to have used the course in the past... does not significantly change the total number. The NCBCPS markets its course by strongly emphasizing the large number of school districts that supposedly teach it; as of late July 2006, its Web site claimed that its curriculum is currently offered in 362 districts nationwide. Such oft-repeated claims now appear to be quite inaccurate. If the situation in Texas is representative, the curriculum is probably actually taught in only a few dozen districts."

==Curriculum legality==
The NCBCPS web site states that the organization's curriculum "has never been legally challenged",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bibleinschools.net/Biographies/Biography-Elizabeth-Ridenour |title=NCBCPS Web site: Biography of Elizabeth Ridenour |accessdate=October 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073914/http://www.bibleinschools.net/Biographies/Biography-Elizabeth-Ridenour |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and features an opinion from four lawyers claiming the course to be constitutional. Whilst the NCBCPS itself has not been sued, two school boards have been for adopting the NCBCPS materials in their district:

===''Moreno v. Ector County School Board''===
A federal lawsuit on behalf of eight parents in [[Odessa, Texas]], was filed on May 16, 2007 against the [[Ector County]] school board. The suit was brought by the [[ACLU]] of Texas, the [[People For the American Way]] Foundation and the law firm of [[Jenner &amp; Block]]. The suit alleged that the course promotes certain religious beliefs to the exclusion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion/schools/bibleinpublicschools.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Successfully Helps Parents Challenge Bible Classes in Texas Public Schools |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ector County School Board was represented by [[Liberty Legal Foundation]]. In a May 17, 2007 article in the ''Odessa American'', ECISD trustee L.V. "Butch" Foreman III said he did not understand how the parents could sue the school board since they do not have children taking the course. "If they don't have children in the class, they can kiss my butt," Foreman said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oaoa.com/onset?id=2353&amp;template=article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829022025/http://www.oaoa.com/onset?id=2353&amp;template=article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 29, 2007 |title=Odessa American: ACLU, parents sue ECISD |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2008, the lawsuit was settled with an agreement by the Ector County School Board to cease teaching NCBCPS materials in its public schools after that current school year. The course offered was taught as an elective in two [[high school]]s and was described as unconstitutionally promoting a particular interpretation of the Bible that is not shared by Jews, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and most Protestants. Bible scholars had seriously criticized the course as lacking accuracy, ignoring scholarly research, promoting a particular religious interpretation of the Bible, and presenting an unbalanced view of American history which promoted specific religious beliefs.

According to the settlement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libertylegal.org/Img/Med%20proposal%20final%20odessa.pdf |title=Settlement of Moreno v. Ector County School Board |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; any Bible course Ector County schools offer in the future cannot be based on the NCBCPS curriculum, and must follow strict legal standards for objectivity and balance. One of the plaintiffs, an ordained elder and deacon at a local Presbyterian Church, said that it was inappropriate for one set of religious beliefs to be promoted over others, and that "It seems as though a church had invaded the public school system – and it wasn’t my church". The ACLU’s Director of Litigation said in a press release that “We trust that any future curriculum will be appropriate for students of all faiths – including nonbelievers – and that it will respect the religious liberty of all Odessans.”  &lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion/schools/34356prs20080305.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union : Texas School Board Agrees To Stop Teaching Unconstitutional Bible Class In Public Schools |accessdate=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gibson v. Lee County School Board''===
The Lee County School Board (Florida) was sued while using the NCBCPS curriculum, for "unconstitutionally advancing religion in public school classrooms." According to the website of People for the American Way Foundation, which represented the plaintiffs in the suit (''Gibson v. Lee County School Board''), "In January 1998, the court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibited the teaching of the 'New Testament' curriculum and allowed the '[[Old Testament]]' curriculum to be taught only under strict monitoring. The court also ordered the two sides to begin settlement negotiations.

"After the court's ruling, the Board agreed to settle the case by withdrawing the 'Old Testament' and '[[New Testament]]' curricula it had adopted and replacing them with a new, objective and non-sectarian course based on a textbook called "''An Introduction to the Bible''."

===Winter 2007 ''Baylor Law Review'' article===
In the Winter 2007 issue of the ''Baylor Law Review'', Amanda Colleen Brown reviewed the NCBCPS' ''The Bible in History and Literature'' and the Bible Literacy Project's ''[[The Bible and Its Influence]]'' (59 Baylor L. Rev. 193). The author subjects both curricula to three legal tests used by the Supreme Court to determine the legality of Bible courses, and concludes that the NCBCPS curriculum is "unfit for use in public school classrooms," while the Bible Literacy Project's curriculum "comports with constitutional standards, thus making it a viable alternative to the NCBCPS curriculum."
Brown argues that a key problem with the NCBCPS curriculum is that it consists of only a teacher's guide, with no student textbook. Brown writes:
{{quote|Using only the Bible makes compliance with the Constitution and regulating the classroom instruction much more difficult. If there is a text to follow, then the majority of what will be discussed in class can be scrutinized and approved or disapproved. It also provides a guide by implication for teachers as to the tone and content of course lessons. Using only the Bible makes inadvertent or intentional Constitutional violations much more likely, since the class content is predominantly lectures by the teacher. Given that the curriculum has a sectarian nature and promotes religious viewpoints, the fact that the Bible serves as the only text makes the effect of the advancement of religion even more likely. It is possible, as well, that the NCBCPS intentionally chose not to develop a text, in order to give the teachers more freedom to control the content of the course toward the views expressed by the NCBCPS in the curriculum.}}

===Opinion of the Attorney General of Georgia===
In 1999, the Attorney General of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Thurbert Baker,  issued an opinion stating that the state's proposed adoption of the NCBCPS courses could not be assured that they would survive a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.ga.us/ag/read.cgi?searchval=Bible%20electives&amp;openval=99-16 |title=Opinion of the Attorney General of Georgia |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum quality==
On August 1, 2005, Dr. Mark Chancey, professor of Biblical studies at [[Southern Methodist University]], released a report through the Texas Freedom Network detailing his concerns about the scholarly quality of the curriculum. Chancey stated that the curriculum was improperly sectarian, and contained "shoddy research, factual errors and plagiarism." In particular, Chancey wrote that the curriculum "uses a discredited urban legend that NASA has evidence that two days are missing in time, thus 'confirming' a biblical passage about the sun standing still [pp. 116–17];" and that more than one-third of the curriculum's 300 pages are reproduced word-for-word from uncredited sources such as Microsoft's ''[[Encarta]]'' encyclopedia. Hundreds of Biblical scholars at universities around the United States have signed on as endorsers of Chancey's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tfn.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_religious_freedom_bible_course_NCBCPS_report_endorsements |title=Texas Freedom Network - Religious Scholar Endorsements |accessdate=October 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080922/http://www.tfn.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_religious_freedom_bible_course_NCBCPS_report_endorsements |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCBCPS responded with an August 4 press release asking the public to "consider the source." The release described the Texas Freedom Network as "a small group of far left, anti-religion extremists ... desperate to ban one book – the Bible – from public schools.&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Chancey_Bible_Curr_Revised.shtml |title=The Bible and Interpretation: The Revised Curriculum of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent article,&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"/&gt;  Dr. Chancey wrote:
{{quote|As early as August 12, however, the NCBCPS was mailing school districts a revised edition of its curriculum, along with a letter urging them in bold, italicized, underlined letters to 'please discard any previous editions of the curriculum that you may have.' ... Why a purportedly problem-free book that had been published only five months earlier needed to be completely replaced was not explained.}}
&lt;!--
On September 9, 2005, the NCBCPS released this updated curriculum at a press conference led by martial arts expert and Bible curriculum advocate [[Chuck Norris]].
--&gt;
Robert Marus of the [[Associated Baptist Press]] Washington Bureau wrote that the revision of the curriculum "incorporat[ed] many of the changes recommended by an organization [the NCBCPS] characterized as 'anti-religion extremists.'" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=3938&amp;print=1 |title=Associated Baptist Press: Controversial Bible curriculum revised |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chicago Tribune'' Editorial Board, in an editorial published July 7, 2007, stated that "The folks at the National Council are right on one count: The Bible should be taught in public schools. But they shouldn't be the ones to do it." The editorial criticised the NCBCPS for not releasing the names of the authors of the curriculum and for "sloppy editing, factual errors and outright copying, word for word, from sources." The Editorial Board noted that "The National Council is not the only option school districts have. A competing curriculum ([[The Bible and Its Influence]]) offered by the Bible Literacy Project, a non-profit group, has been vetted, accepted and praised by a wide range of scholars, critics and education officials."

''TIME'' Magazine, in the cover story of its April 2, 2007 issue, wrote that the curriculum is not "legally palatable ...  Its spokespeople claim it is refining itself as it goes and its most recent edition, which came out last month, eliminates much literalist bias—but still devotes 18 lines to the blatantly unscientific notion that the earth is only 6,000 years old." By contrast, ''TIME'' stated that "[Public school Bible electives] should have a strong accompanying textbook on the model of (the Bible Literacy Project's) The Bible and Its Influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1601845,00.html |title=TIME Magazine, The Case for Teaching the Bible |accessdate=March 6, 2010 | work=Time | date=March 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Foundation for Educational Research''' ('''NFER''') was founded in 1946 as a centre for educational research and development in England and Wales. NFER's head office is located at 'The Mere' in [[Slough]], [[Berkshire]], England. The foundation also has offices in [[Swansea]] and [[York]].

The foundation's work includes educational research, evaluation of education and training programmes,  and the development of assessments and specialist information services. The NFER also sponsors the CERUKplus (Current Educational Research in the UK) database, which contains details of current or on-going research in education and related disciplines, and hosts the EURYDICE Unit for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in EURYDICE, the information network on education in Europe (www.nfer.ac.uk/eurydice).

The NFER founded [[nferNelson]], which they sold to the [https://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/ Granada Learning/GL assessments for the 11+ and other common entrance exams] Group in 2000.

== Departments ==
There are five main departments that carry out research and a variety of other services;
* Department for Research in Assessment and Measurement

==Controversy==
===2005===

The [[Torah Academy of Bergen County]] from [[Teaneck, New Jersey]] had won its state's 2005 competition, but faced difficulties in its ultimately successful effort to gain accommodations to participate in the National High School Mock Trial Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina without being required to compete during the Jewish Sabbath.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The [[American Mock Trial Invitational]] was created in 2006 by the New Jersey State Bar Foundation and the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers as an alternative competition to address concerns of religious commitments by competing school teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njsbf.org/njsbf/student/mocktrial/amti.cfm American Mock Trial Invitational], accessed April 19, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208143147/http://www.njsbf.org/njsbf/student/mocktrial/amti.cfm |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Record&gt;Aberback, Brian.

===2009===

[[Maimonides School]] of [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] won the 2009 Massachusetts state championship and desired to participate in the national championship in Atlanta, Georgia. Due to [[kosher|religious dietary restrictions]] and [[Shabbat]] observance the school asked for accommodation in order to participate without violating their religious beliefs. The school asked for two trials to be changed from Saturday to Thursday or Friday in order to avoid violating Shabbat. In response the school obtained attorney [[Nathan Lewin]] to represent the school. Lewin filed a complaint with the [[US Department of Justice]] alleging [[religious discrimination]] and a violation of [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/education/06mock.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us | work=The New York Times | title=National Mock Trial Competition Encounters a Real Legal Challenge | first=Robbie | last=Brown | date=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney [[Elizabeth Price (attorney)|Elizabeth Price]] resigned from the Georgia State Bar in protest over the National Board refusing to grant the requests for accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/us/07brfs-RESIGNATIONO_BRF.html?ref=us | work=The New York Times | title=Georgia: Resignation Over Trial Contest | date=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Defamation League sent a letter of protest to the National Board complaining against the lack of reasonable accommodation, asking the National Board not to punish children for their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5522_00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Congress]] condemned the National Board for failing to provide for these accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=11281&amp;pageid=89&amp;pagename=Features&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2009, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Doris Downs ruled that unless the competition would accommodate the Orthodox Jewish students, then the courthouse would not be allowed to be used for the competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/dpp/news/Mock_Trial_Competition_to_Host_Jewish_Team_050709&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/us/07brfs-RESIGNATIONO_BRF.html?ref=us | work=The New York Times | title=Georgia: Resignation Over Trial Contest | date=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maimonides.org/about/newsDetail.php?id=224&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Organization workshop''' ('''OW''') – or ''"Laboratorio Organizacional"'' (LO) in both [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] – is a [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)|CHAT]]-based learning event where participants master new organizational as well as social knowledge and skills through a [[experiential learning|learning-by-doing approach]]. It is aimed at large groups of unemployed and underemployed, a large number of whom sometimes may be persons with lower levels of education (LLEs). The OW addresses locally identified problems which can only be solved by collaborating groups. During a Workshop participants form a temporary enterprise which they themselves manage, an enterprise which contracts to do work at market rates. Once the workshop temporary enterprise is over, organizational, management and vocational skills gained can be used to form new businesses or social enterprises.

== Field of study ==

de Morais' initial observation was that people, forced by circumstances and sharing one single resource base, learn to organize in a complex manner, involving a [[division of labor]]. During the seminal (1954 [[Recife]], Brazil) event which he attended, a large group of activists had gathered in an ordinary town house, where "the cramped conditions of the house, combined with the need for secrecy so as not to arouse the suspicion of the police, ... imposed on the group a strict organizational discipline in terms of division and synchronization of all the tasks needed for such an event".&lt;ref&gt;Sobrado in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent finding that little was learned about the event's supposed topic but instead, "an enormous lot about organization" became the inspiration and starting point for the design of what eventually was to become the organization workshop. Building on this, subsequent Moraisean practitioners corroborated de Morais' original finding that "organization" is not taught but "achieved" by a properly composed large group.{{sfn|Andersson|2010|p=2, Slide #5}}
[[File:MeansofProduction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Part of the shared resource base ('Inventory') at the Ntambanana OW (South Africa) November 2012]] 
The OW field of study in the broadest sense is [[social psychology]], the discipline that bridges the gap between [[psychology]] and sociology. Because the OW large group approach is [[Cultural-historical activity theory|Activity-based]]{{sfn|de Morais|1987|p=19-23}}&lt;ref&gt;de Morais in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000}} p.32&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Labra|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;Sobrado in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Andersson|2013}} it stands out in a field notable for a long tradition of [[behaviorism]]-based "small group" approaches, such as [[group dynamics]] and [[T-groups|T-group]] training.

"Activity-based" means that for people to learn, a real object has to be actually present; as Jacinta Correia puts it: "to learn how to ride a bike, you need a bike to ride on".&lt;ref&gt;Correia in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Correia|1994}} Thus, for a large group to learn how to manage a complex&lt;ref&gt;because based on the [[division of labor]].&lt;/ref&gt; enterprise, it has to have a complex enterprise to manage. In the OW context, this means that a group averaging 150, many of whom often with lower levels of education, are actively engaged, for an entire month, in (a) productive or service provision enterprise(s). For all the apparent, e.g., [[training|on-the-job training]] and [[action learning]] parallels, the OW's defining features are not only the need for a cooperative large group and the creation of (a) complex, real enterprise(s), but, principally, the position of the trainer and the way in which training messages are communicated. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as  "scaffolding" in activity theory).{{sfn|Andersson|2013|loc=p.24 quoting [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]] n.59}} In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor, but "''the object that teaches''".&lt;ref&gt;Sobrado in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|loc=p. 209: ''the traditional relationship between trainee and instructor ceases to apply''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Andersson|2004|loc=p.221-2  "de Morais' antecedent thought: Objectivised Activity"}}{{sfn|Correia|2007|loc=p. 6: re: Objective Activity}}{{sfn|Andersson|2013a}}

The OW originated in Brazil with de Morais' 1954 Recife workshop. In the wake of the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|coup d'état]] of March 1964, de Morais went into a 23-year exile in Chile, and the OW spread from there in the late sixties. After specializing in Cultural Anthropology ([[Santiago University]]) and in Land Reform at the ICIRA (Capacitation and Research Institute for Agrarian Reform Institute), de Morais became consultant for international and national development institutions and NGOs. Since then, the organization workshop has become a constant in a number of agrarian reform efforts in Latin America and (community) development projects elsewhere. From Chile, the OW spread to Costa Rica, Mexico, Panamá, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Ecuador, Honduras, Peru, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, the Caribbean, a number of African countries as well as Europe.{{sfn|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|p=51.

=== During an OW ===

[[File:OWfreedomtoorganizewithinlaw.jpg|thumb|OWfreedomtoorganizewithinlaw]]Running an OW requires both a facilitators' enterprise (FE) and a participants' enterprise (PE), originally called "primary" and "secondary" structures by de Morais and called respectively "crew" and "team" in, for example, the SABC-televised Kwanda OWs in South Africa in the noughties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lebo |last1=Ramafoko |first2=Gavin |last2=Andersson |first3=Renay |last3=Weiner |title=Reality Television for Community Development – The Kwanda Initiative in South Africa |url=http://ojs.ub.gu.se/ojs/index.php/gt/article/view/1297/1126 |journal=Glocal Times |volume=17/18 |date=September 2012|issue=17/18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Labra|Labra|2012| p=6}}{{sfn|Andersson| 2010 |p=2, Slide #4}}&lt;ref&gt;In South Africa, the OW was applied by, among others, the [http://www.seriti.org.za/ Seriti Institute], [http://www.soulcity.org.za/  Soul City Institute] and government departments such as South Africa's  [http://www.dsd.gov.za/  Department of Social Development].&lt;/ref&gt;  The FE is the framework set up for all organizational and learning activities before, during and after the Workshop.

Labra in {{harvnb|Carmen|Labra|Davis|1999}} p 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; The participants' first job, in turn, is to set up a PE which, usually after a period of trial and error referred to as [[wikt:anomie|anomie]] by de Morais,{{sfn|de Morais|1987|p=119}}{{sfn|Van Dam|1982|p=28}} starts organizing work, subject to negotiation of a contract with the FE.

Lectures on the "theory of organization" (TO){{sfn|Labra|Labra|2012|p=25 10.4}} are an integral and compulsory part of the OW process. These lectures (1 ½ hours a day for two weeks) are meant to enable members of the PE to gain a perspective on their historical, social and economic context, on the working of the market economy, on current patterns and models of organization, as well as insights in individual and collective behavior.  
Skills acquired include practical enterprise organization and management skills including labor and time management, financial record-keeping and reporting, planning, quoting and tendering for work, vocational skills such as e.g. building, welding, tailoring, farming, catering or IT skills, and literacy and numeracy development.&lt;ref&gt;I. &amp; I.

=== Post-OW ===
Sponsoring bodies since the 1960s have ranged from United Nations organizations to local and international development agencies and NGOs, among them [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], [[terre des hommes]], [[Concern Worldwide]], [[Catholic Relief Services]], [[Hivos]] and [[Norwegian People's Aid]], Redd Barna and, recently e.g. in South Africa, the Soul City Institute and government departments such as South Africa's Department of Social Development.

Correia considers drawing up a correct quantitative, let alone qualitative balance sheet of the OW experience a "virtually impossible" task. Based on results of qualitative research into the OW she conducted, she tentatively "ventures some conservative estimates": 15% of OW participants are estimated to subsequently start an enterprise of one kind or another which, in the case of Brazil – (anno 2000, the publication year of 'A Future') – amounts to 9,000 enterprises.

[[File:LaurelOWClosingCeremony.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Closing Ceremony Laurel OW 2005. Among the Vocational courses the 543 participants chose were English (see banner), Carpentry, Electronics, Confectionery, IT, and others.]]
An additional estimated 30% (equivalent to 8,000 persons) subsequently find work. Counting in family members, she arrives at 27,000 persons who, in her research sample, "have drawn some economic benefit from the OW, ... at an estimated unit cost of a mere $16 per person".&lt;ref&gt;Correia in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersson similarly estimates the impact of the 2009–10 Kwanda program in South Africa: 5,000 participants; 200,000 community member beneficiaries; 2,000,000 viewers and listeners reached per week.{{sfn|Andersson|2010|p=4 slide #3}}

== Controversy ==

The activity-based OW approach stands out from mainstream behaviorism-based small group approaches. That is by itself a potential source of controversy in both academia and accepted field practice.{{sfn|Labra|1994}}{{sfn|Andersson|2004|loc=p.60, p.249, p.262-9 "Small group Lewinian Social Psychology"}}&lt;ref&gt;See also Andersson (2013) on Lewin and small group "bounded" approach in [[#External links|external links]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critique of the OW (and, indirectly, of de Morais) has come from both [[left-wing politics|left]] and [[right-wing politics|right]], the latter, wary of de Morais' conceptual mode and language "throwback to the 50s" in which de Morais' original ''Theory of Organization'' is couched, "felt that his ideas needed rejecting".{{sfn|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|p=21}}  Nonetheless his format was readily accepted by international organizations over the decades.{{sfn|Andersson|2004|p=130}} Van Dam{{sfn|Van Dam|1982|p=61}} adds that the Latin American "bourgeois establishment" clearly saw peasant autonomy brought about by the OW as "a threat to the established order" and did all in their power to disrupt it, for example by withholding state support.
 
The "institutional left", broadly defined as countries identifying, pre 1989, with the [[Eastern Bloc]], including Cuba, never embraced de Morais' autonomous job creation and income generation method. Revolutionary Nicaragua did allow the 1980 COPERA or "Capacitation Project for the Organization of Producers and Job Creation" OW pilot project, sponsored by the ILO and the Nicaraguan Institute for Agrarian Reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bornstein, |first=C.T. |year=1982 |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/83150674 |title=A Reforma Agraria en Nicaragua |trans-title=Agrarian Reform in Nicaragua |publisher=Brasiliense |location=[[São Paulo]], Brazil}}, quoted in {{harvnb|de Morais|1987|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was to become the mould for a nationwide Nicaraguan SIPGER (Job &amp; Income Generation System), on the Honduran model, but the Sandinista government cut short the project on 29 December 1980, with a memorandum critical of the OW: "those Experimental Laboratories&lt;ref name="Experimental" /&gt; contribute to the bourgeois mindset in capitalist countries" while "surplus production serves the particular group and not the national interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integraterra.org/Repository/Nicaragua/Evalnic.htm |title=Puntos de consideracion sobre la implementacion de Laboratorios Experimentales |trans-title=Points of consideration on the implementation of Experimental Laboratories |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dam concurs by noting that a revolutionary Sandinista government, beset by internal economic crisis, conflict with neighboring States and a Contra uprising, felt that it needed to be strongly 'in control' of the political process, including 'popular participation'.{{sfn|Van Dam|1982|p=58}}

A second strand of "left" criticism tends to come, on the one hand, from the ideological 'hard' left "whose trenchant criticism of de Morais derives partly from [this] apparent neglect of the exploitative features of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], while there is open admiration for [the OW's] organizing method"{{sfn|Andersson|2004|loc=p. 148. Andersson singles out Kate Truscott's vocal criticism of de Morais at a SACNET -(Southern Africa Cooperative Network)- Seminar held in Harare in 1990}} and, on the other hand, from what could be broadly termed the "[[liberation theology]]/[[Paulo Freire|Freirean]] [[Critical consciousness|conscientization]]" stream of practice, which de Morais encountered when working with the MST (Landless Workers) Movement in Brazil. Morais (sometimes also spelled "Moraes") – typically is criticized by this group for, among other things, being too "rigid and dogmatic". The latter's critical views tend to express a preference for Freirean-inspired [[critical pedagogy]] [[Critical consciousness|consciousness-raising]] and [http://www.liberationhealth.org/documents/freiresummarysimmons.pdf "root cause"]-finding approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomaz |first=Fernanda|year=2009 |url=http://www.geografia.fflch.usp.br/inferior/laboratorios/agraria/Anais%20XIXENGA/artigos/Thomaz_F.pdf |title= A ORGANIZAÇÃO DO TRABALHO CAMPONÊS NA VISÃO DE CLODOMIR SANTOS DE MORAIS – The Organization of rural labor according to Clodomir Santos de Morais |publisher= XIXth Meeting of the Agrarian Geography group|location=São Paulo, Brazil |language=Portuguese |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas de Morais' method focuses on "organizational" consciousness.{{sfn|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|loc= [organizational] which includes 'critical' consciousness re: Ch. 4 -From Freire to Clodomir Santos de Morais: from Critical to Organizational Consciousness}}

Sobrado points to another source of resistance to the OW, which does not necessarily come from either left or right, but is rooted, instead, in the status quo, perceived to be threatened by "a sure fire way of developing the capacities of the poor". This "annoys the organizations and institutions that appear to operate according to a more or less cleverly disguised [[clientelism|clientelist]] hidden agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Sobrado in {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Josh Fisher's 2010 detailed ''Génesis'' case study  ''Building Consciousness: The Organization Workshop Comes to a Nicaraguan Cooperative'' can be counted as a critique of the OW.  Fisher argues that "the most illuminating aspect of the Génesis OW...is not its success or failure, narrowly defined, but rather the unintended consequences [of the OW] that have originated in large part from the space between the actual existing social and organizational dynamics in the Génesis cooperative before the workshop, on the one hand, and the OW's model for those dynamics, on the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Josh |last=Fisher |year=2010 |page=71 |title=Building Consciousness: The Organization Workshop Comes to a Nicaraguan Cooperative |journal=Anthropology of Work Review |volume=31 |issue=10 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1417.2010.01043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Education]]''' – in the general sense is any act or [[experience]] that has a formative effect on the [[mind]], [[Moral character|character]], or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] from one generation to another. Education can also be defined as the process of becoming an educated person.&lt;ref&gt;Don, Berg. "Definition of Education." teach-kids-attitude-1st.com. N.p., n.d.

== Educational philosophies ==
* Traditions in education
** [[Idealism]] – This tradition emerged in Greece and the famous philosophers who introduced this concept were Socrates and his pupil Plato. The basic concept launched was that all the things we see in this world are actually the copy not original.  What ever we produce here becomes an idea in our mind. So whatever we work to create something is first takes shape in ideas and minds, so the true reality is Idealism.They both supported an education which provides the opportunity to develop mental faculties and make student think properly to find any reality.
** [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] – Aristotle, the pupil of Plato was the person who got the concept of Realism and argued that the Idealism is not the only reality, but there are many natural things which are the part of our atmosphere and we come across those things. Whatever we observe is very important to work on and find the realities using empirical evidences. So the education that is based on experience and observable realities will guide the students to find out the reality. The same has relevance to the philosophy of Positivism.
** [[Educational perennialism|Perennialism]] – This concept was introduced by Robert Hutchins who was of a view that the education should have ever-lasting impact on the students and therefore the only ever-last ideas should be taught. for that he supported the religious concepts to be incorporated in the curriculum.
** [[Existentialism]] – Kierkegaard argued that all the philosophers are of a view to inculcate into the students which is something outdoor with reference to the students. He told that realities are subjective and they are with the individuals themselves. The education should work on individuals to harness the inner realities.
** [[Theism]] – Thomas Aquinas introduced the church doctrine in education and emphasized that reason and faith are complimentary so the both ideas should be the base of education and the students should go by the reasons introduced by the faith, church or religion.
** [[Essentialism]] – The education philosophies were taking many turns in the twentieth century when William Bagley raised his voice to attract the attention of the theoreticians telling that the education should have a core basics of the culture and heritage. The students should be given choice of study the said core subject and they should go to the 1930s education where the same was used to teach.
** [[Pragmatism]] – John Dewey was the person who told that in education a democratic view is to be implemented. Students should be given a chance to explore themselves and they should go by their own instinctive drives.
** [[Critical thinking]] – There was a team of German theoreticians like Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas who gave the concept of Critical Theory and argued that the education which provides the students and prepare them to analyze the things under discussion, is the basic requirement of education.
** [[Social education]] – In his book, Social Education, Applied Perspective, Muhammad Zahid Azeem Zahid has argued that the education which provides the opportunity to the students to find their space in society and the education should be in line with the societal need not only individually but holistically as well. The Social Education Model is to be implemented in the third world countries as there is a big need to join the individual and society. An educated person can become a good professional and can lead a good life individually, but the need of the day is that he or she should keep his profession and the lifestyle favorable to the society as well....

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''Overlearning''' refers to practicing newly acquired skills beyond the point of initial mastery.  The term is also often used to refer to the [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] theory that this form of practice leads to [[automaticity]] or other beneficial consequences.

== Early studies ==
[[Memory]] researcher [[Herman Ebbinghaus]] performed classical overlearning studies in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gardner|title=An Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology|year=1929|publisher=International Library of Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGs04j1ypooC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=murphy+ebbinghaus+historical+introduction+to+modern+psychology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jBNvVC9PuS&amp;sig=GI2yi_uuujOnG2KZufiSb18iSs8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iKRUcLMMpSQ8wSu4YGAAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=murphy%20ebbinghaus%20historical%20introduction%20to%20modern%20psychology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noticed that memory for learned material decreased over time (see also [[forgetting curve]]). Ebbinghaus recognized that lists of nonsense syllables became more difficult to recall over time, and some lists required more review time to regain 100% recall. He defined '''overlearning''' as the number of repetitions of material after that material can be 100% recalled.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

== Contemporary work ==
A 1992 [[meta-analysis]] suggested that overlearning does significantly affect recall over time. It also concluded that the size of this effect may be moderated by the amount of overlearning, task type, and length of retention.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driskell|first=James E.|author2=Willis, R. P. |author3=Copper, C. |title=Effect of Overlearning on Retention|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1992|volume=77|issue=5|pages=615–622|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.5.615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested overlearning effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both types of task showed an effect of overlearning. The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt; The amount of overlearning affected retention: more overlearning led to more retention on both types of task.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;  The length of the retention interval also affected overlearning, but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants overlearning physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;

Some recent studies explicitly examined the interaction of overlearning with retention interval, and concluded that the effects of overlearning tend to be fairly short-lived.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K.|title=The Effects of Overlearning and Distributed Practise on the Retention of Mathematics Knowledge|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=1209–1224|doi=10.1002/acp.1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K. |author3=Pashler, H. |author4=Wixted, J. T. |author5=Cepeda, N. J. |title=The Effect of Overlearning on Long-Term Retention|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=19|pages=361–374|doi=10.1002/acp.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlearning may be more useful in instances when learners only need short-term retention of the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning geography facts and word definitions ===
In one study, researchers examined the effects of overlearning [[geography]] facts or word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt;  After one week, overlearners recalled more geography facts and word definitions than non-overlearners, but this improvement gradually disappeared after the study.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt; This research suggests that overlearning may be an inefficient study method for long-term retention of geography facts and word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt; Overlearning improves short-term retention of material, but learners must also spend more time studying. Over time the improvements created by overlearning fade, and the learner is no better off than someone who did not spend time overlearning the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning mathematics ===
In another study, researchers compared the effects of overlearning and distributed practice on [[mathematics]] knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt; Distributed practice refers to practice that is spaced over time. In Experiment 1, participants completed 10 math problems either all at once or distributed across two sessions. Participants in the distributed practice condition performed no differently from participants in the single-session condition one week later, but distributed practice participants did perform better than single-session participants four weeks later. In Experiment 2, participants completed either three or nine practice problems in one sitting. When participants were retested one or four weeks later, no differences were found between three-problem and nine-problem participants. Researchers found no effect of overlearning on mathematics [[Recall (memory)|retention]].&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt;

[[File:Two people in a gym using BOSU balls.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A personal trainer demonstrating use of a [[Bosu]] ball.]]

A '''personal trainer''' is an individual certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in [[exercise prescription]] and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback and accountability to clients. Trainers also measure their client's strengths and weaknesses with fitness assessments. These fitness assessments may also be performed before and after an exercise program to measure their client's improvements in [[physical fitness]]. They may also educate their clients in many other aspects of wellness besides exercise, including general health and nutrition guidelines.  

Qualified personal trainers recognize their own areas of expertise. If a trainer suspects that one of their clients has a medical condition that could prevent the client from safe participation in an exercise program, they must refer the client to the proper health professional for prior clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Earle|first=Roger|title=NSCA's Essentials of Personal Training|year=2004|publisher=NSCA Certification Commission|isbn=0-7360-0015-1|pages=162, 617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of personal training ==
[[Image:Personal trainer assessing a client's goals and needs as they write a fitness programme.jpg|thumb|left|Personal trainer assessing a client's goals and needs as they write a fitness program]]  The scope of practice for a personal trainer is to enhance the components of fitness for the general, healthy population.

Proper [[exercise prescription]] may result in improved [[body composition]], physical performance, heart condition and health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision to hire a trainer may be related to a perceived ability to facilitate these factors through proper prescription and instruction or factors related to [[motivation]] and adherence. A trainer pays close attention to their client's exercise form, workout routine, and nutrition plan.

Few studies have investigated training for men, however, training in women has been shown to exercise behavior patterns, improve perceptual benefit-to-concern ratio for exercise (decisional balance), and increase confidence to choose exercise in the face of other time demands (scheduling self-efficacy).&lt;ref&gt;Fischer DV, Bryant J. Effect of certified personal trainer services on stage of exercise behavior and exercise mediators in female college students. J Am Coll Health. 2008 Jan-Feb;56(4):369-76. {{PMID|18316279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal training results in higher strength, higher workout intensities, and higher perceived exertion during exercise in women. Although women working with personal trainers do self-select heavier loads than women who did not, the loads used are still below recommended training load percentages.&lt;ref&gt;Ratamess NA, Faigenbaum AD, Hoffman JR, Kang J. Self-selected resistance training intensity in healthy women: the influence of a personal trainer. J Strength Cond Res. 2008 Jan;22(1):103-11. {{PMID|18296962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment characteristics ==

The profession is generally not restricted by venue, and personal trainers may work in fitness facilities, in their personal homes, in client homes, over live video (also called "virtual personal trainers"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-virtual-training-google-hangouts-20130819-story.html |title=South Floridians giving webcam workouts rave reviews |first=Johnny |last=Diaz |date=August 30, 2013 |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111904/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-virtual-training-google-hangouts-20130819-story.html |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or outdoors. Almost all personal trainers and group exercise instructors work in physical fitness facilities, health clubs, and fitness centers located in the amusement and recreation industry or in civic and social organizations.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos296.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917084446/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos296.htm |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal training is not regulated in any jurisdiction in the United States except for Washington D.C. which adopted registration requirements for personal fitness trainers in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, David L, DC Opts to Regulate Personal Trainers, The Exercise, Sports and Sports Medicine Standards &amp; Malpractice Reporter, March, 2014, Volume 3, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal trainers may specialize in a certain training type, training philosophy, performance type, exercise modality, or client population. In general, most personal trainers develop exercise prescription plans for [[aerobic exercise]], [[resistance exercise]], and/or [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] training. With aerobic exercise prescription, personal trainers determine the type of exercise, duration of exercise, and frequency of exercise. For resistance exercise prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Chapter 12. Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal trainers may also be involved in prescription of stretching routines or other approaches. Personal trainers help clients to perform exercises with correct technique, minimising the risk of injury. While some discuss nutrition, [[ergogenic]] supplementation, and spiritual practices with clients, there is debate within the industry as to whether it fits within their scope of practice and training qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frances H. Q. | year = 2009 | title = Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17430430802673726?journalCode=fcss20 | journal = Taylor &amp; Francis | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 375 | doi=10.1080/17430430802673726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
[[File:MARIANA DE MELO.JPG|thumb|upright=1.05|Personal training outdoors]]
Personal trainer accreditation is a process that provides [[certification]] of competency as a personal trainer. Qualification standards for personal trainers vary between countries.

===Australia===
In Australia, personal trainers may work independently with suitable insurance or choose to be a member of a registering body (Fitness Australia or Physical Activity Australia). The qualifications levels include; Level 1 - Certificate III in Fitness, Level 2 - Certificate IV in Fitness and Level 3 - Diploma of Fitness. These can be obtained from nationally accredited colleges (TAFE, Australian College of Sport &amp; Fitness, Fitness Industry Training, Global Fitness Institute, [[Australian Institute of Fitness]], Australian Fitness Academy). Once working in the industry, trainers who are members of associations are also required to complete short courses to obtain [[continuing education unit|continuing education credit]] (CEC) points they need to keep their registration. A minimum of 20 CEC points every two years is required. Many personal trainers also have additional qualifications in weight loss, strength training, kid's fitness, and nutrition, which is in part due to the CEC program. CEC courses can cover a wide variety of topics such as different training techniques, nutrition, exercise styles, health conditions, physiology, lifestyle and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitness.org.au/116127_47417047.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304124800/http://www.fitness.org.au/116127_47417047.html |date=March 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], personal trainers must have a [[bachelor's degree]] in "Physical Education" (a degree that combines knowledge in the fields of [[Exercise Science]] and [[Healthcare science]]) and be registered with the Conselho Federal de Educação Física (Federal Council of Physical Education), and risk criminal charges if they operate without these two requirements.

===Canada===
In Canada, the main certifying bodies are Canadian Fitness Education Services (CFES), Canadian Fitness Professionals, Certified Personal Trainers Network, and Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology. CSEP requires a diploma or degree in the exercise field, most require experience and/or workshops. Ontario does not have any personal training regulation. Many personal trainers receive a CFES, CanFit Pro certification or an NCCA accredited certification. The National Personal Training Institute is the only private trade school and is a registered College under the Private Career Colleges Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalpti.edu/school/toronto-ontario/|title=Personal Trainer Certification in Toronto, Ontario|website=nationalpti.edu|access-date=2016-05-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514224822/http://nationalpti.edu/school/toronto-ontario|archivedate=2016-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Johnathan|last=Goodman|title=Top Personal Training Certifications: Canada|url=http://www.theptdc.com/2011/11/top-personal-training-certifications-canada/|accessdate=29 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523140438/http://www.theptdc.com/2011/11/top-personal-training-certifications-canada/|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, personal trainers may work independently, but will always need accreditation by one of the main certifying bodies  {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} such as:

'''NASM:''' National Academy of Sports Medicine. NASM Certified Personal Trainers are eligible to join the European Register of Exercise Professionals (EREPS). The NASM has attributed to the success of personal trainers in Europe and accredited companies like UNITEDFIT in the Netherlands became recognized as a qualified fitness organization in Europe.

'''EREPS:''' The European Register of Exercise Professionals (EREPS) is an independent process for the registering of instructors, trainers and teachers working in the European health, fitness and physical activity sector. It is a pan-European system, based on independent national registers, which culminate in a central European database.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, there are several ways to achieve a personal training qualification. Most personal training qualifications are accredited through awarding bodies like CYQ (Central YMCA Qualifications), Active IQ (Active International Qualifications) and City and Guilds. These qualifications are generally delivered by [[Further Education]] (FE) establishments like colleges, or by private training providers. Upon successful completion of an accredited awarding body qualification, candidates become eligible for Level 3 REPs(Register of Exercise Professionals)status. University graduates with an appropriate honours degree can also apply to become an approved by REPs through Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) and Accreditation of Prior Achievement (APA).

REPs is the professional body for the UK health and fitness industry, and does not award qualifications directly. Most health and fitness qualifications endorsed by REPs vary in levels from 1 - 5, 1 being basic GCSE level and 5 being advanced specialized training professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exerciseregister.org/about-reps/reps-entry-structure |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920065949/http://exerciseregister.org/about-reps/reps-entry-structure |archivedate=2012-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a qualification to become eligible for endorsement by REPs, it must conform to the [[National Occupational Standards]] (NOS), which are set at governmental level by the [[Sector Skills Council]] (SSC) Skills Active.

There is no legal restriction on the title of Personal Trainer nor any formal body associated with regulating Personal Training.

===United States===
A number of certifications are available in the U.S., although a number are not accredited. Most require a high school diploma, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[automated external defibrillator]] (AED) certification, and some type of examination.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

A 2002 investigation evaluated a random sample of 115 personal trainers using the Fitness Instructors Knowledge Assessment (FIKA) (which measures knowledge in nutrition, health screening, testing protocols, exercise prescription, and special populations). The study described that:&lt;ref&gt;Malek MH, Nalbone DP, Berger DE, Coburn JW. Importance of health science education for personal fitness trainers. J Strength Cond Res. 2002 Feb;16(1):19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moh H. Malek, PhD, CSCS,*D and Tamara K. Coburn. The Level of Exercise Science Knowledge Among Personal Fitness Trainers: A Guideline.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20100509062447/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Personal%20Trainers%20Knowledge.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* 70% of those surveyed did not have a degree in any field related to [[exercise science]].
* Those who did not have a [[bachelor's degree]] in an exercise science-related field scored 31% less on average than those with a bachelor's degree or higher in the field.
* Those holding one of two specific certifications (the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) or the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) certification) scored 83% of the questions correctly on average. Those holding any certification other than ACSM or NSCA answered only 38% of the questions correctly.
* Years of experience was not found to be predictive of personal trainer knowledge.

In partnership with the fitness industry, the International Health, Racquet &amp; Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), which represents over 9,000 health and fitness facilities, started an initiative in 2002 to improve standards for both its own clubs and the industry as a whole. In January 2006, IHRSA implemented a recommendation that its facilities only accept personal trainers with certifications recognized by the [[National Commission for Certifying Agencies]] (NCCA) if recognized either by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and/or the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] (USDE). As a result, the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) was recognized by IHRSA as a recognized accreditor of fitness professional certification organizations.  Since then, the DETC has accredited several personal trainer certification organizations, including the [[Aerobics and Fitness Association of America|Aerobics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA)]] and the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA) among others.  As of August 2012, [[National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)|NASM]], ISSA, AFAA, ACSM and NSCA certifications are among the 15 accredited certifications recognized by IHRSA, three of which are accredited by the Distance Education Training Council (DETC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihrsa.org/home/2010/1/14/accreditation-announcement-to-ihrsa-members.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413080001/http://www.ihrsa.org/home/2010/1/14/accreditation-announcement-to-ihrsa-members.html |archivedate=2011-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Trainers as Professionals|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130920012400/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various organizations within the profession have lobbied for the adoption of a more stringent criteria for certification developed by the [[NSF International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cotton|first=Richard|title=Personal Trainers as Professionals|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130920012400/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/august/personal-trainers-as-professionals|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There remains no national legal restriction on the industry to date except for the District of Columbia (D.C.) which as of February 2014, passed legislation requiring personal fitness trainers to register in that jurisdiction. The law went into effect in the first half of 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20700">A '''qualifications framework''' is a formalized structure in which [[learning level descriptors]] and qualifications are used in order to understand learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=Qualifications%20Framework|title=Qualifications Framework|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the ability to develop, assess and improve quality education in a number of contexts. Qualifications frameworks are typically found at the National, Regional, and International level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=10, 12–13, 15–16, 21, 31–33, 35, 76–77, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of qualification structures can be traced back to organized education in antique civilizations such as [[Greece]], [[Sparta]], [[Rome]] and [[China]]. As no specialized career structure existed in these cultures, organized education focused on broad issues of international citizenship, and not on vocational preparedness, which was achieved mainly through informal apprenticeships. As civilizations developed, the role of social class and caste received more emphasis, and people who displayed certain competences were grouped together. The advantage of having participated in and benefited from education gradually became more visible as civilizations developed. In this respect the Chinese civilization was the most organized, with a series of levels attached to examinations, which in turn granted the right of access to public office. During the [[Middle Ages]] education had a particularly religious nature, while the late medieval centuries were categorized by a new approach to education alongside the clergy and feudal knighthood. New economic objectives as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the development of banking, importing and shipping across Europe and the West gave rise to the development of cities, and a new form of education aimed at professional life. Education became available to the middle classes, and the merchant and craft guild system developed.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;De Villiers, H. C. 1997. Affirmative action and the qualification structure. Unpublished Master's dissertation, University of Pretoria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first institutions of formal higher education were established at this time in the Islamic universities of [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] in Cairo and [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]] in Timbuktu.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell, R. 2007. Bridging between orthodox Western higher educational practices and an African sociocultural context. ''Comparative Education'', Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 23–51.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, universities were developing in Europe, largely in reaction to the previous narrow religious doctrine. The establishment of the [[University of Bologna]] marked the beginning of the European university tradition. This was also the time when the term 'qualification' acquired a more definite meaning, although it retained its emphasis on social class structures. The nineteenth century brought with it a wave of liberalism and consciousness of equal rights and opportunities, accompanied by increased specialization and bureaucratization.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The increased need for skilled employees eventually resulted in an emphasis on&amp;nbsp;credentials which persists to the present day. During the twentieth century the emphasis shifted to [[Human Capital Theory|human capital theory]] and technological development, eventually leading to concerns whether the education system was able to meet the demands of the labour market. At the time it was argued that the strong divisions were creating barriers to learning, and that there was a need to do away with the sharp distinction between academic and vocational systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the late 1980s, and strongly influenced by the thinking on integration but also by a focus on vocational training through a competency approach, the notion of a National Qualification Frameworks (NQF) emerged in the United Kingdom. Its roots lay in the competence approach to vocational education which was broadened by Jessup,&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, G. 1991. ''Outcomes: NVQs and the Emerging Model of Education mid Training''. New York, RoutledgeFalmer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Scottish Action Plan]] which led to the modularization of vocational education and training in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Education Department (SED). 1983. ''16–18s in Scotland: An Action Plan''. Edinburgh, SED.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea developed that all qualifications could be expressed in terms of outcomes without prescribing learning pathways or programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Young, M. F. D. 2005. ''National Qualifications Frameworks: Their Feasibility and Effective Implementation in Developing Countries''. Geneva, ILO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Within this politically charged melting pot of factors, and a renewed emphasis on the importance of lifelong learning, the first NQFs were established in Australia, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa between 1989 and 1995.&amp;nbsp;France, as a country with a different, notably non-Anglo Saxon tradition, was also a member of this group of first-generation NQFs (Bouder, 2003; Keevy et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bouder, A. 2003. Qualifications in France: towards a national framework? Journal of Education and Work, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 347–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Charraud, A. and Allgoo, K. 2011. National qualifications frameworks developed in Anglo-Saxon and French traditions. Considerations for sustainable development in Africa. Research report for the ADEA Triennial on Education and Training in Africa, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 27 November – 2 December 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of France, the NQF drew on a hierarchy of qualifications that found official expression at the end of 1960s in a nomenclature which tried to rationalize the number of students leaving the education and training system to correspond with the needs of the labour market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Across the first-generation countries, NQFs were conceptualized as hierarchical classifications of levels of formal learning programmes and their associated qualifications and certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, M., Keevy, J., Bateman, A. and Keating, J. 2014. Flying blind: policy rationales for national qualifications frameworks and how they tend to evolve.&lt;/ref&gt; Integral features of NQFs included new quality assurance and standards-setting regimes based on learning outcomes, and importantly for this study, level descriptors which are used to determine the level at which a qualification should be pegged.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, R. 2007. An Introductory Guide to NQFs: Conceptual and Practical Issues for Policy Makers. Geneva, ILO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== Construction ==
All qualifications frameworks are learning outcomes-based. In qualifications frameworks, qualifications are developed using learning outcomes, and the set of hierarchical levels they consist of are described with a set of learning level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Qualifications frameworks emerged from two complementary education and training discourses in the late 1980s: the competence approach to [[vocational education]], and the shift to learning outcomes, embedded within the broader concept of [[lifelong learning]]. As a result, the interrelationship between competences and learning outcomes was not only firmly embedded in qualifications framework thinking from the very outset, but was also used in a hybridized form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

== National level ==
{{Main|National Qualifications Framework}}

A National Qualifications Framework (NQF) addresses the educational quality concerns of specific countries. Some examples include:
* [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF)
* [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF)
* German Qualifications Framework (Deutsche Qualifikationsrahmen, DQR)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Regional level ==
A Regional Qualifications Framework (RQF) focuses specifically on qualifications at the regional level. Some examples include:
* [[European Qualifications Framework]] (EQF)
* [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] RQF 
* [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]] TVET Qualifications Framework (TVET QF) 
* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] RQF
* Qualifications Framework for the [[European Higher Education Area]] (QF-EHEA) 
* Pacific Qualifications Register (PQR)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International level/World reference levels ==
The purpose of the world reference levels lies mainly in their potential to provide a neutral and independent reference point against which a level of learning can be assessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The idea of a set of world reference levels was considered in May 2012, during the Third International Congress on [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|TVET]], held in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]]. The research included in this report was initiated by [[UNESCO]] based on the recommendation from the Congress to the UNESCO Director-General to undertake this work. The UNESCO TVET Section, in cooperation with the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture|Directorate General for Education and Culture]] and the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (CEDEFOP), subsequently invited key organizations in [[Brussels]] to deliberate on the [[Shanghai Consensus Recommendation]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. Shanghai Consensus: Recommendations of the Third International Congress on Technical and Vocational Education and Training 'Transforming TVET: Building skills for work and life', Shanghai, People's Republic of China, 14 to 16 May.&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2013. The deliberations included regional developments in Europe, notably the [[European Qualifications Framework]] (EQF) and in Asia, notably a common standard for competences developed by the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), as well as the move towards [[regional qualifications frameworks]] (RQFs) in [[Central America]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). At the national level, the development of [[National Qualifications Framework|national qualifications frameworks]] (NQFs) was considered across and beyond these regions, including [[Mercosur]] (Mercado Común del Sur, the Common Market of the South) in South America and the development of a [[transnational qualifications framework]] (TQF) by twenty-nine small states of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;COL and SAQA. 2008. Transnational Qualifications Framework for the Virtual University of Small States of the Commonwealth. Concept Document. Pretoria: Commonwealth of Learning and South African Qualifications Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; The additional dimension of learning metrics as used in longitudinal studies, international competence assessments and diagnostics reviews was also considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Brussels deliberations concluded that the mobility of people (both learners and workers, including migrant workers) and jobs (including outsourcing and offshoring) constitutes an important driver for the world reference levels&lt;ref&gt;Chakroun. 2013. Outcomes of the workshop, Engaging global conversations on recognition of TVET quali cations based on learning outcomes, 25–27 September 2013, Brussels, unpublished report.&lt;/ref&gt; emanating from the Shanghai Consensus Recommendation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was noted that jobs are not always matched to demands during these movements, because of demographic shifts and the differential capacities of economies to create jobs. The cross-border provision of education and training, as well as the technological developments resulting in increased open and distance learning, and online learning, were also identified as important drivers towards world reference levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another important driver identified in the Brussels deliberations was the need for international dialogue, cooperation and capacity-building in the  field of the recognition of qualifications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other types of frameworks ==

=== Sectoral qualifications frameworks&amp;nbsp;===
Sectoral qualifications frameworks are developed within a specific country and with a specific sectoral focus. Examples include: 
* a TVET framework in Jamaica 
* the occupational qualifications subframework in South Africa 
* the General Education Qualifications Framework in Poland
* the Engineering Sectoral Framework in Armenia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Transnational qualifications frameworks&amp;nbsp;===
Transnational qualifications frameworks are developed across a range of countries. Where these countries are in the same geographical proximity they are referred to as regional qualifications frameworks (examples include the SADC RQF and the EQF). Transnational qualifications frameworks can also be developed across countries that are not in the same geographic proximity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== For online learning ===

==== The E-xcellence framework ====
The E-xcellence framework was developed by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU). It is an instrument for benchmarking the quality of online, open and flexible education at programme, faculty and institutional levels. The framework defines requirements (called "benchmarks") for the entire process, from [[Curriculum development|curriculum design]] to delivery, including the management and support of online and blended learning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The OpenupEd quality label ====
The OpenupEd quality label is derived from the E-xcellence framework. Ossiannilsson and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Ossiannilsson, E., Williams, K., Camilleri, A., &amp; Brown, M. (2015). ''Quality models in online and open education around the globe: State of the art and recommendations''. Oslo, Norway: International Council for Open and Distance Education.&lt;/ref&gt; identified this framework as useful for certification and benchmarking. The label describes a self-assessment and review Quality Assurance (QA) process for the [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] (Massive open online courses) in the European OpenupEd partnership,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openuped.eu&lt;/ref&gt; but the OpenupEd framework can be used for the QA of any MOOC. The benchmarks statements in this label, derived from benchmarks produced by the E-xcellence framework, are divided into two groups: those that apply at the institutional level and those for individual courses (MOOCs).&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Learning level descriptors ==
{{Main|Learning level descriptors}}

Learning level descriptors are essential elements in Qualifications Frameworks. Learning Level descriptors are statements that provide a broad indication of learning appropriate to attainment at a particular level, describing the characteristics and context of learning expected at that level. They are designed to support the reviewing of specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria in order to develop particular modules and units and to assign credits at the appropriate level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vlasceanu, L., Grünberg, L. and Pârlea, D. 2007. Quality assurance and accreditation: a glossary of basic terms and de nitions. Bucharest, UNESCO Centre Européen pour l'Enseignement Supérieur (CEPES). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001346/134621e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning outcomes ==
A learning outcome is a measurable result of a learning experience which allows us to ascertain to which extent / level / standard a competence has been formed or enhanced.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lokho , J., Wegewijs, B., Durkin, K., Wagenaar, R., González, J., Isaacs, A., Rose, L. and Gobbi, M. (eds). 2010. ''A Tuning Guide to Formulating Degree Programme Profiles Including Programme Competences and Programme Learning Outcomes''. Bilbao, Groningen and The Hague. Manabile, E. 2007. Summary of the revised Bloom's taxonomy. Unpublished.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learning outcomes can be used to describe many things, including knowledge, skills and competences (KSC), in the context of qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are increasingly being used in global context 'as a dynamic tool for modernisation and reform'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;CEDEFOP. 2009. ''The Shift to Learning Outcomes''. Luxembourg, CEDEFOP.&lt;/ref&gt; The key mechanism through which the learning outcomes approach is being implemented is qualifications frameworks, but there are also others, such as within [[curriculum]] reform on both national and international levels. [[The Tuning Project]], which started in 2000, stands out as a good example of the introduction of learning outcomes outside of, but nonetheless related to, qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are used in the formulation of qualifications, and also in the formulation of level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Definitions of the concept of learning outcomes vary across contexts, although some common elements can be identified. Here are several definitions. Learning outcomes...
* Describe what students will know and be able to do upon successful completion of a course or programme.&lt;ref&gt;University of Adelaide. 2014. Guide to writing learning outcomes. www.adelaide.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;
* The contextually demonstrated end-products of specific learning processes which include knowledge, skills and values.&lt;ref&gt;SAQA. 2014. NQFpedia: Standard Glossary of Terms. www.saqa.org.za&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Statements of what a learner knows, understands and is able to do after the completion of learning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* A statement of what students should know, understand and can do upon the completion of a period of study.&lt;ref&gt;MQA. 2011. ''Malaysian Qualifications Framework. Point of Reference and joint understanding of higher education qualifications in Malaysia''. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Quali cations Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knowledge, skill, and aspects of competence that a learner is expected to know and be able to do.&lt;ref&gt;NQAUAE. 2012. ''Qualifications Framework Emirates Handbook''. Abu Dhabi, NQAUAE.&lt;/ref&gt;
From a review of the interpretation of learning outcomes it is evident that learning outcomes are understood to be statements that describe mainly three major domains: knowledge (learning to know), skills (learning to do) and competences (learning to be).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 1996. Learning: ''The Treasure Within. Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competences ===
The interrelationship between learning outcomes and competences is best illustrated in qualifications frameworks.&amp;nbsp;While learning outcomes often describe competences, competences can also be stand alone. Competences represent a dynamic combination of cognitive and meta-cognitive skills, demonstration of knowledge and understanding, interpersonal, intellectual and practical skills, and ethical values.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">The '''[[Robert Byrd|Robert C. Byrd]] Honors Scholarship Program''' was a federally funded and state-administered [[Merit-based financial aid|merit-based]] scholarship program in the United States.

== Program History ==
It was designed to recognize exceptionally able high school seniors who showed promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education. The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Office of Postsecondary Education]] awarded funds to state education agencies, which awarded [[scholarships]] (also known as '''Byrd Honors Scholarships''') to eligible applicants. Students received scholarship funds which were to go towards [[college]] expenses.

=== Funding ===
The Byrd Honors Scholarships were established in 1985, providing $1,500 nonrenewable scholarships to eligible students. In 1993, the program was expanded to allow students who successfully completed their first year of college to reapply for stipends for the following three years. This brought the scholarship to its final value of $6,000 over four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html Byrd.senate.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031004216/http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html |date=2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To pay for the over 27,000 scholars supported by the program, appropriations for the program were nearly $40,000,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/gtepiduesbyrd.pdf Ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the scholarship was eliminated for the 2011-2012 school year. As a result, new awards are not being given for that year, and payments for returning students will not be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hesc.com/content.nsf/SFC/Robert_C_Byrd_Honors_Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application Requirements ==
Each state set the criteria for awarding the Byrd Honors Scholarships in addition to federal requirements. In any case, all applicants were to be high school graduates who:
* had been accepted for enrollment at institutions of higher education(IHEs) in the United States;
* had demonstrated outstanding academic achievement;
* and who showed promise of continued academic excellence.

The '''STARSHINE''' (Student Tracked Atmospheric Research Satellite Heuristic International Networking Experiment) series of three artificial [[satellite]]s were student participatory missions sponsored by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL).

==Satellite description==
[[File:Starshine4 5 300.jpg|thumb|125px|left|STARSHINE Logo]]

STARSHINE-1 was a spherical satellite that was fitted with almost nine hundred small mirrors polished by students from around the world. Once launched, a network of over 20,000 students from eighteen countries tracked the satellite by observing sunlight glinting off the mirrors and networked their observations via the Internet. The students used these observations to calculate air drag, solar activity, and other orbit related properties of the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;

STARSHINE-2 and -3 had systems added to impart spin to these satellites in an effort to improve the solar-reflected flash rate, as well as a number of laser [[retroreflector]]s to introduce the students to [[satellite laser ranging]].&lt;ref&gt;

The satellites were constructed largely from spare flight hardware.

In November 2001, the amateur radio payload on STARSHINE-3 was designated STARSHINE-OSCAR-43, or SO-43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13551">The '''STEM pipeline''' is a term used to describe the educational pathway for students in the [[STEM fields]], (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The start and end of this STEM pipeline are disputed, but it is often considered to begin in early education and extend into graduation or an adult career in STEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/stem/files/2015/02/The-STEM-Pipeline-booklet1.3-36.pdf|title=The STEM Pipeline|last=Inside Higher Ed|first=|date=2015-02-09|website=Boston University STEM Education Initiatives|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The "pipeline" metaphor is based on the idea that having sufficient graduates requires both having sufficient input of students at the beginning of their studies, and retaining these students through completion of their academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Educational Pipeline FAQ| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://www.highereducation.org/reports/pipeline/faq.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The STEM pipeline is a key component of [[Diversity (business)|workplace diversity]] and of [[Workforce|workforce development]] that ensures sufficient qualified candidates are available to fill scientific and technical positions.

The STEM pipeline was promoted in the United States from the 1970s onwards, as “the push for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education appears to have grown from a concern for the low number of future professionals to fill STEM jobs and careers and economic and educational competitiveness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Ryan|last2=Brown|first2=Joshua|last3=Reardon|first3=Kristin|last4=Merrill|first4=Chris|title=Understanding STEM: Current Perceptions|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ918930|journal=Technology and Engineering Teacher|language=en|volume=70|issue=6|pages=5–9|issn=2158-0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this metaphor is commonly used to describe retention problems in STEM fields, called “leaks” in the pipeline. For example, the White House reported in 2012 that 80% of minority groups and women who enroll in a STEM field switch to a non-STEM field or drop out during their undergraduate education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|date=2015-07-16|title=Why we are teaching science wrong, and how to make it right|url=http://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963|journal=Nature|volume=523|issue=7560|pages=272–274|doi=10.1038/523272a}}&lt;/ref&gt; These leaks often vary by field, gender, ethnic and racial identity, socioeconomic background, and other factors, drawing attention to structural inequities involved in STEM education and careers.

==Current efforts==
The STEM pipeline concept is a useful tool for programs aiming at increasing the total number of graduates, and is especially important in efforts to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/report_diversifying_the_stem_pipeline_report.pdf|title=Diversifying the STEM pipeline: the Model Replication Institutions Program|last=Institute for Higher Education Policy|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using STEM methodology, educational policymakers can examine the quantity and retention of students at all stages of the K&amp;ndash;12 educational process and beyond, and devise programs and interventions to improve educational processes and outcomes. STEM programs focus on increasing social and academic supports for students. STEM programs may also focus on bringing students together with professionals in their field, to provide mentoring, [[role model]]s and learning opportunities in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stempipelineinstitute.com/?page_id=9|title=STEM Methodology - Teachers in teams, STEM Innovation at work|work=STEM Pipeline Institute|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a healthy and diverse STEM pipeline has been a concern in several developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/CaSEDiversityinSTEMreport2014.pdf|title=Improving Diversity in STEM: A report by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)|last=King's College, London|work=Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/stem-diversity-initiatives-what-works-what-doesnt|title=STEM diversity initiatives—what works, what doesn't|last=Larkin|first=Marilynn|date=2014-02-12|work=Elsevier Connect|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en|title=President Obama Launches "Educate to Innovate" Campaign for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math (Stem) Education|date=2009-11-23|work=The White House|accessdate=2015-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308185543/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en|archivedate=2015-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], although efforts to increase the number of [[women]] and [[African Americans]] in STEM fields have been ongoing, as recently as 2010 the results have been evaluated as "poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Robelin| first = Erik W.| title = U.S. Gets Poor Grades in Nurturing STEM Diversity| work = Education Week| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2010-03-22| url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2010/03/22/27stem.h29.html?tkn=NWVFcgAJIKVsbeYl2%2BToW1DL8nSEuQXi5ytU&amp;cmp=clp-edweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Davis-Lowe| first = OPAS Diversity Committee| title = Fostering STEM Diversity| work = Elsevier Connect| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = November 2007| url = http://www.elsevier.com/connect/stem-diversity-initiatives-what-works-what-doesnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, one report declared that "traditionally underrepresented groups remain underrepresented",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Stem pipeline problems to aid STEM diversity| work = Phys.org| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2014-06-18| url = http://phys.org/news/2014-06-stem-pipeline-problems-aid-diversity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article commented, "You can go through your entire scholarly trajectory in [[computer science]] without seeing one face of color", where "of color" refers to African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Institute for African American Mentoring in Computing Sciences| title = Creating a Computer Science Pipeline for African Americans| work = Wisconsin Center for Education Research| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2014-04-28| url = http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/news/coverStories/2014/Creating_a_Computer_Science_Pipeline_for_African_%20Americans.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STEM pipeline programs in the US have been created at various levels. Examples include: the Technology Leadership Institute at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] at the college and university level,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Lack of diversity part of equation in STEM fields| work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2009-02-10| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2009/02/10/Lack-of-diversity-part-of-equation-in-STEM-fields/stories/200902100187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nevada STEM pipeline at the state level &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Nevada STEM Pipeline, Your Resource for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Programs| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://www.nvstempipeline.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = –2014| last = Charleston| first = LaVar J| title = Creating a Pipeline for African American Computing Science Faculty: An Innovative Faculty/Research Mentoring Program Model| journal = Journal of Faculty Development| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://weilab.wceruw.org/documents/Creating%20a%20Pipeline%20for%20African%20American%20Computing%20Science%20Faculty%20-%20An%20Innovative%20Faculty-Research%20Mentoring%20Program%20Model.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational attainment factors ==
High Schools in the United States implement a STEM pipeline program that combines a dual pathway that enhances mathematical, engineering, and scientific skills along with a supportive group that aims to help underrepresented students aspire to become leaders in the STEM field. Students benefit from the moral support and motivational skills that mentors implement for their correct academic preparation. Teachers, and college mentors become in the life of the students in the program a guidance in their path to be the next generation of leaders. Furthermore, staff members aid students to feel integrated and cared for their well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/training/minority_participation.pdf|title=Expanding underrepresented minority participation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their path to pursue higher education in the STEM fields, underrepresented students are awarded scholarships that aid them throughout their college years. Scholarships are a factor that allows underrepresented to focus on their academic and allows them to be persistent throughout their years in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cue.usc.edu/files/2016/01/DC_Testimony.pdf|title=BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN STEM|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The STEM pipeline program provides a multitude of workshops, and extracurricular activities to work on social and professional development. Moreover, it arranges networking with minorities that went through the program and now currently work in the science, or health field. In addition, to the benefits as an alumnus of the program, every student is invited to become advocates within their community with the goal of increasing the amount of underrepresented students in STEM fields &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.uncfsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=jri|title=The STEM Pipeline: Recruiting and Retaining African American Female Engineers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The support of programs such as the STEM pipeline program aims to increase diversity in the workplace with the ambition to create an inclusive safe area where all the members of the team can contribute to the development of innovative ideas in their respective field. Additionally, the diversity of collaborating with different ideas enhances the outcome of the team's desired goal, and facilitates better planning of the timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stelar.edc.org/sites/stelar.edc.org/files/ITEST_Preparing_Workforce_FINAL_hires.pdf|title=Preparing Tomorrow’s STEM Workforce Through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reactions==
The concept of the STEM pipeline has been met with resistance for its pragmatic overtones. National Science Board Vice Chairman Kelvin Droegemeier calls for a movement away from thinking about the necessary number of STEM workers, in favor of considering the necessary knowledge and skills for the success of all workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134866|title=Revisiting the STEM workforce {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linearity of the STEM pipeline concept has been criticized as neglecting the wide variety of possible career pathways, including interdisciplinary studies, intermittent careers, and STEM-informed work in non-technical fields. A 2015 commentary in Inside Higher Ed suggested that the "leaky pipeline" metaphor may be viewed as pejorative towards individuals who leave the academic track for employment, or use their technical background as the basis for a career in a non-technical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/03/03/essay-calls-ending-leaky-pipeline-metaphor-when-discussing-women-science#.VPXuS0yfvkw.twitter|title=Essay calls for ending the 'leaky pipeline' metaphor when discussing women in science|last=Miller|first=David|date=2015-03-03|work=@insidehighered|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 commentary in ''Science'' observed that [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Angela Merkel]] could be considered two "leaks" in the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penner|first=A.&amp;nbsp;M.|date=2015-01-16|title=Gender inequality in science|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3781|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6219|pages=234–235|doi=10.1126/science.aaa3781|issn=0036-8075|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have said that increasing the STEM pipeline is not enough to promote workplace diversity. Women and minorities in STEM such as [[Tracy Chou]] have argued that STEM companies must also focus on internal reforms, such as reevaluating inequitable hiring practices and unsupportive workplace culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252|title=Where are the numbers?|last=Chou|first=Tracy|date=2013-10-11|website=Medium|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''school leaving age''' is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[secondary education]]. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.

In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but  (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.

==Leaving age by country==
Some countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment. The table below states the school leaving ages in countries across the world and their respective minimum employment age, showing a comparison of how many countries have synchronised these ages. All information is taken from the Right to Education Project's table unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/279 |title=Country Table - At What Age?...are school-children employed, married and taken to court|publisher=The Right to Education Project|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining a havo or vwo diploma, the student is no longer obligated to go to school regardless of their age. Except those students which have done vmbo, they must have a mbo level 2 or higher diploma before quitting school.

Also, all children between those ages, even if they're refugees or new, have to attend school.
Not attending school with-out proper reason for example; sickness or a doctors visit, is illegal and is seen as wagging which is seen as fraud and punishable by law. Until the age of 12 children cannot be punished by law, but as soon as your child or you turn 12 years of age or older, you can be held responsible for wagging.
Punishments can be done as a fine, temporary jail time or a community service job done under supervision. Fines can be up to € 3 900 00.
These punishments can be given to the student and/or his or her legal parent or guardian.}}

Standardized tests are designed in such a way that the questions, conditions for administering, scoring procedures, and interpretations are consistent&lt;ref name="Sylvan"&gt;Sylvan Learning glossary, retrieved online, source no longer available&lt;/ref&gt; and are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner.&lt;ref name="Popham"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Popham | first1 = W.J. | year = 1999 | title = Why standardized tests don't measure educational quality | url = | journal = Educational Leadership | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 8–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any test in which the same test is given in the same manner to all test takers, and graded in the same manner for everyone, is a standardized test. Standardized tests do not need to be [[high-stakes test]]s, time-limited tests, or [[multiple-choice test]]s. The questions can be simple or complex.  The subject matter among school-age students is frequently academic skills, but a standardized test can be given on nearly any topic, including [[driving test]]s, creativity, [[Personality test|personality]], [[professional ethics]], or other attributes.

The opposite of standardized testing is ''non-standardized testing'', in which either significantly different tests are given to different test takers, or the same test is assigned under significantly different conditions (e.g., one group is permitted far less time to complete the test than the next group) or evaluated differently (e.g., the same answer is counted right for one student, but wrong for another student).

Most everyday quizzes and tests taken by students typically meet the definition of a standardized test:  everyone in the class takes the same test, at the same time, under the same circumstances, and all of the students are graded by their teacher in the same way.  However, the term ''standardized test'' is most commonly used to refer to tests that are given to larger groups, such as a test taken by all adults who wish to acquire a license to have a particular kind of job, or by all students of a certain age.

Because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system, standardized tests are often perceived as being fairer than non-standardized test. Such tests are often thought of as fairer and more objective than a system in which some students get an easier test and others get a more difficult test. That perception, which may or may not be accurate, depends entirely on the purpose for the test. If a teacher wishes to determine individual children's skills with respect to a specific activity, tests other than those that are standardized are more effective. Standardized tests are designed to permit reliable comparison of outcomes across all test takers, because everyone is taking the same test.&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Essays/v4n3.htm|title=Role &amp; Importance of Testing|last=Phelps|first=Richard P.|website=nonpartisaneducation.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While that point is granted, often the children tested have not been exposed to the same materials found on those standardized tests. Equally often, such tests are constructed by individuals who have no knowledge of the test-takers beyond their age and/or grade level. Age and/or grade level, however, are poor indicators of what children have learned.  As a result, conclusions drawn from the results can easily be wrong.&lt;ref name="jojoem"/&gt; The prevalence of standardized testing in formal education has also been criticized for many reasons.

==Definition==
The definition of a standardized test has changed somewhat over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSt1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=423|title=21st Century Education: A Reference Handbook|last=Olson|first=Amy M.|last2=Sabers|first2=Darrell|date=October 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=|isbn=9781452265995|editor-last=Good|editor-first=Thomas L.|location=|pages=423–430|language=en|chapter=Standardized Tests|doi=10.4135/9781412964012.n46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, standardized tests were defined as those in which the conditions and content were equal for everyone taking the test, regardless of when, where, or by whom the test was given or graded. The purpose of this standardization is to make sure that the scores reliably indicate the abilities or skills being measured, and not other things, such as different instructions about what to do if the test taker does not know the answer to a question.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 21st century, the focus shifted away from a strict sameness of conditions towards equal fairness of conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a test taker with a broken wrist might write more slowly because of the injury, and it would be more fair, and produce a more reliable understanding of the test taker's actual knowledge, if that person were given a few more minutes to write down the answers to a most test.  However, if the purpose of the test is to see how quickly the student could write, then this would become a [[Special education#Modifications|modification]] of the content, and no longer a standardized test.

==History==
===China===

{{main|Imperial examination}}
The earliest evidence of standardized testing was in [[China]], during the Han Dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112424/Chinese-civil-service|title=Chinese civil service|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[imperial examination]]s covered the [[Six Arts]] which included music, archery, horsemanship, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies of both public and private parts.  These exams were used to select employees for the state bureaucracy.

Later, sections on military strategies, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography were added to the testing. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized for more than a millennium.

Today, standardized testing remains widely used, most famously in the [[Gaokao]] system.

===UK===
Standardized testing was introduced into Europe in the early 19th century, modeled on the Chinese [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] examinations,&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; through the advocacy of British colonial administrators, the most "persistent" of which was Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]], Thomas Taylor Meadows.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; Meadows warned of the collapse of the British Empire if standardized testing was not implemented throughout the empire immediately.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt;

Prior to their adoption, standardized testing was not traditionally a part of Western pedagogy; based on the skeptical and open-ended tradition of debate inherited from Ancient Greece, Western academia favored non-standardized assessments using [[essay]]s written by students. It is because of this, that the first European implementation of standardized testing did not occur in Europe proper, but in [[British India]].&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the Chinese use of standardized testing, in the early 19th century, British "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; This practice of standardized testing was later adopted in the late 19th century by the British mainland. The parliamentary debates that ensued made many references to the "Chinese mandarin system."&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Mark and Boyer (1996), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was from Britain that standardized testing spread, not only throughout the [[British Commonwealth]], but to [[Europe]] and then America.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; Its spread was fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The  increase in number of school students during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]], as a result of [[compulsory education]] laws, decreased the use of open-ended assessment, which was harder to mass-produce and assess objectively due to its intrinsically subjective nature. For instance, measurement error is easy to determine in standardized testing, whereas in open-ended assessment, graders have more individual discretion and therefore are more likely to produce unfair results through [[unconscious bias]].  When the score depends upon the graders' individual preferences, then the result an individual student receives depends upon who grades the test.

More recently, standardized testing has been shaped in part, by the ease and low cost of grading of multiple-choice tests by computer. Though the process is more difficult than grading multiple-choice tests electronically, essays can also be graded by computer.  In other instances, essays and other open-ended responses are graded according to a pre-determined assessment [[rubric]] by trained graders.  For example, at Pearson, all essay graders have four-year university degrees, and a majority are current or former classroom teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Grading the Common Core: No Teaching Experience Required|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/grading-the-common-core-no-teaching-experience-required.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-06-22|access-date = 2015-10-06|issn = 0362-4331|first = Motoko|last = Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Further|List of standardized tests in the United States}}
Standardized testing has been a part of American education since the 1800s, but the widespread reliance on standardized is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. For instance the College Entrance Examination Board did not begin standardized testing in connection to higher education until 1900. The College Entrance Examination Board was established and in 1901, the first examinations were administered around the country in nine subjects. This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding school in order to standardize curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darity Jr|first1=William|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=5&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;docType=Topic+overview&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL.corecollection&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;inPS=true|website=Encyclopedia for Background Information|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With origins in [[World War I]] the [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta|Beta]] tests developed by [[Robert Yerkes]] and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S.

Originally the standardized test was made of essays and was not intended for widespread testing. French psychologist Alfred Binet begins developing a standardized test of intelligence, work that would eventually be incorporated into a version of the modern IQ test, dubbed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. The College Board then designed the SAT(Scholar Aptitude Test) in 1926 for a broader IQ test. Notably, the Army IQ tests were what the first SAT test was based on in order to determine a student’s intelligence, problem solving skills, and critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darity Jr|first1=William|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;docType=Topic+overview&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL.corecollection&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;inPS=true|website=Encyclopedias for Background Information|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, [[Everett Franklin Lindquist|Everett Lindquist]] offered the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] (American College Testing) for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Dan.

Large population state testing began in the 1970s, and in the 1980s America began to assess nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiggins|first1=Richard|title=Assessment Crisis: The Absence Of Assessment FOR Learning|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|date=2002|url=http://beta.edtechpolicy.org/CourseInfo/edhd485/AssessmentCrisis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, together 45 states is annual spending on assessments cost $27 per student and $669 million overall.

[[List of United States federal legislation|U.S. Public Law]] 107-110, known as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, further ties public school funding to standardized testing. The goal of No Child Left Behind was to improve the education system in the United States by holding school and teachers accountable and attempting to close the educational gap between minority and non-minority children in public schools. Students' results on standardized tests were used to allocate funds and other resources such as teachers and administrators to schools.  This policy does not provide a federal standard for schools, but allows each state to set their own standards.&lt;ref&gt;"History and Background of No Child Left Behind".

Standardized testing is a very common way of determining a student's past academic achievement and future potential.  However, [[High stakes tests|high-stakes tests]] (whether standardized or non-standardized) can cause anxiety.

An additional factor to consider in regards to standardized testing in the United States education system, is the socio-economic background of the students being tested. Research has shown that children from low-income and poor families do not receive the same emphasis on education from their parents as those students from higher income families. According to the Nation Center for Children in Poverty, 41 percent of children under the age of 18 fall into the category of lower income. (Kobal, H. and Jiang, Y., 2018) This is a large percent of the student population who start behind the learning curve and require specialized attention to get to where they need to be in order to perform well on the standardized test.&lt;ref&gt;Kobal, H. and Jiang, Y., (2018) Basic Facts about Low Income Children. Retrieved from http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_1194.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
The Australian National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) standardized testing was commenced in 2008 by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, an independent authority "responsible for the development of a national curriculum, a national assessment program and a national data collection and reporting program that supports 21st century learning for all Australian students".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/|title=Home – The Australian Curriculum v8.1|website=www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testing includes all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in Australian schools to be assessed using national tests. The subjects covered in these testings include Reading, Writing, Language Conventions (Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation) and Numeracy.

The program presents students level reports designed to enable parents to see their child's progress over the course of their schooling life, and help teachers to improve individual learning opportunities for their students. Students and school level data are also provided to the appropriate school system on the understanding that they can be used to target specific supports and resources to schools that need them most. Teachers and schools use this information, in conjunction with other information, to determine how well their students are performing and to identify any areas of need requiring assistance.

The concept of testing student achievement is not new, although the current Australian approach may be said to have its origins in current educational policy structures in both the USA and the UK. There are several key differences between the Australian NAPLAN and the UK and USA strategies. Schools that are found to be under-performing in the Australian context will be offered financial assistance under the current federal government policy.

==Design and scoring==
[[File:Cito Eindtoets Basisonderwijs.JPG|thumb|right|Some standardized testing uses multiple-choice tests, which are relatively inexpensive to score, but any form of assessment can be used.]]
Standardized testing can be composed of multiple-choice questions, true-false questions, essay questions, [[authentic assessment]]s, or nearly any other form of assessment.  Multiple-choice and true-false items are often chosen because they can be given and scored inexpensively, quickly, and reliably through using special answer sheets that can be read by a computer or via [[computer-adaptive test]]ing. Some standardized tests have short-answer or essay writing components that are assigned a score by independent evaluators who use [[Rubrics (education)|rubrics]] (rules or guidelines) and benchmark papers (examples of papers for each possible score) to determine the grade to be given to a response. Not all standardized tests involve answering questions; an authentic assessment for athletic skills could take the form of running for a set amount of time or [[dribbling]] a ball for a certain distance.

Most national and international assessments, however, are not fully evaluated by people; people are used to score items that are not able to be scored easily by computer (such as essays). For example, the [[Graduate Record Exam]] is a computer-adaptive assessment that requires no scoring by people except for the writing portion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.1488512ecfd5b8849a77b13bc3921509/?vgnextoid=302433c7f00c5010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=7196e3b5f64f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD#Scoring_and_Reporting ETS webage] about scoring the GRE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "normative assessment" refers to the process of comparing one test-taker to his or her peers. A [[norm-referenced test]] (NRT) is a type of test, [[Educational assessment|assessment]], or [[evaluation]] which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] drawn from the population. This type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other students taking this test. A [[criterion-referenced test]] (CRT) is a style of test which uses [[Test (student assessment)|test]] scores to show whether or not test takers performed well on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material.

===Scoring issues===
Human scoring is relatively expensive and often variable, which is why computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid employees will score tests badly.&lt;ref name=Houtz&gt;Houtz, Jolayne (August 27, 2000) [http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=4039520&amp;date=20000827&amp;query=wasl+pearson+pay+hour "Temps spend just minutes to score state test A WASL math problem may take 20 seconds; an essay, 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes"].  ''Seattle Times'' "In a matter of minutes, a $10-an-hour temp assigns a score to your child's test"&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. Sometimes states pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.&lt;ref name=Houtz/&gt;

Open-ended components of tests are often only a small proportion of the test. Most commonly, a major academic test includes both human-scored and computer-scored sections.

Along with scoring the actual tests, teachers are being scored on how well their own students are performing on the tests. Teachers are faced with the incredible pressure to continuously bring scores up to be judged on whether or not they are worthy of keeping their job. There has been a lot of discussion covering how accurate of a way that to score a teachers' success because there are so many factors that go in to how well his or her students perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ub5he7kv4q.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Relying+on+High-Stakes+Standardized+Tests+to+Evaluate+Schools+and+Teachers%3A+A+Bad+Idea&amp;rft.jtitle=Clearing+House%3A+A+Journal+of+Educational+Strategies%2C+Issues+and+Ideas&amp;rft.au=Morgan%2C+Hani&amp;rft.date=2016&amp;rft.pub=Routledge&amp;rft.issn=0009-8655&amp;rft.eissn=1939-912X&amp;rft.volume=89&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=67&amp;rft.externalDocID=EJ1104410&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Relying on High-Stakes Standardized Tests to Evaluate Schools and Teachers: A Bad Idea.|last=Morgan|first=Hani|date=2016|website=EBSCOhost|access-date=May 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scoring how well teachers do, how is there a way in which they could find a teacher to blame it on if they are in high school or even middle school, where there is not only one teacher, but a teacher for each subject?

Often, colleges are giving scholarships to students who score well on standardized tests like the ACT or the SAT. Students' intellectual level is judged by the score they receive, but the issue is that even if a student scores well on a standardized test that gets them to college, that does not imply that the student is smart. A student can do well on the test and fail out of college. It is not the best indicator of how well a student actually performs, but how well they test.

There is a lack of oversight. Teachers are told to watch over the students and be as organized as possible when collecting and grading the tests, but there are numerous sources stating all of these instances where students, even teachers are cheating. Students have been known to somehow accommodate the answers, or during breaks, teachers are not told to watch over the conversations held; they could easily discuss questions and figure out the answers together. Teachers, more of which are in "desperate situations" find that they are changing the answers for their students themselves to make it look like they are great teachers and it would take away from the pressure they feel in raising scores. "The accountability system is whats driving [standardized testing] and it's fundamentally flawed."

There are two types of standardized [[test score]] interpretations:  a [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] score interpretation or a [[criterion-referenced test|criterion-referenced]] score interpretation.
* '''Norm-referenced score interpretations''' compare test-takers to a [[Sample (statistics)|sample of peers]].  The goal is to rank students as being better or worse than other students.  Norm-referenced test score interpretations are associated with [[traditional education]].  Students who perform better than others pass the test, and students who perform worse than others fail the test.
* '''Criterion-referenced score interpretations''' compare test-takers to a criterion (a formal definition of content), regardless of the scores of other examinees.  These may also be described as [[standards-based assessment]]s, as they are aligned with the [[standards-based education reform]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Where We Stand: Standards-Based Assessment and Accountability (American Federation of Teachers) [http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/downloads/teachers/StandAssessRes.pdf/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824050606/http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/downloads/teachers/StandAssessRes.pdf/|date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criterion-referenced score interpretations are concerned solely with whether or not this particular student's answer is correct and complete.  Under criterion-referenced systems, it is possible for all students to pass the test, or for all students to fail the test.

Either of these systems can be used in standardized testing.  What is important to standardized testing is whether all students are asked equivalent questions, under equivalent circumstances, and graded equally.  In a standardized test, if a given answer is correct for one student, it is correct for all students.  Graders do not accept an answer as good enough for one student but reject the same answer as inadequate for another student.

==Standards==
The considerations of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the quality of any standardized test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing [[Standards organization|standards]] and making overall judgments about the quality of any standardized test as a whole within a given context.

===Evaluation standards===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/|title=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation|work=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/|archivedate=15 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published three sets of standards for evaluations.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. The tests are aimed at ensuring that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance, however; standardized tests offer narrow information on many forms of intelligence and relying on them harms students because they inaccurately measure a student's potential for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ub5he7kv4q.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Relying+on+High-Stakes+Standardized+Tests+to+Evaluate+Schools+and+Teachers%3A+A+Bad+Idea&amp;rft.jtitle=Clearing+House%3A+A+Journal+of+Educational+Strategies%2C+Issues+and+Ideas&amp;rft.au=Morgan%2C+Hani&amp;rft.date=2016&amp;rft.pub=Routledge&amp;rft.issn=0009-8655&amp;rft.eissn=1939-912X&amp;rft.volume=89&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=67&amp;rft.externalDocID=EJ1104410&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Relying on High-Stakes Standardized Tests to Evaluate Schools and Teachers: A Bad Idea.|last=Morgan|first=Hani|date=March 2016|website=ub5he7kv4q.search.serialssolutions.com|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing standards===
In the field of [[psychometrics]], the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/science/standards.html#overview|title=The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing|work=http://www.apa.org|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; place standards about validity and reliability, along with [[Measurement#Difficulties|errors of measurement]] and issues related to the [[special education#Accommodations|accommodation]] of individuals with [[Disability|disabilities]].  The third and final major topic covers standards related to testing applications, [[Professional certification|credentialing]], plus testing in [[program evaluation]] and [[Standardized testing and public policy|public policy]].

== Importance of testing ==
Standardized testing is considered important and these tests do assess what is taught on the national level. They are used to measure objectives and how schools are meeting educational state standards.

There are three primary reasons for Standardized tests: Comparing among test takers, Improvement of ongoing instruction and learning, and Evaluation of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2016|title=Standardized Tests Purpose is the Point|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/apr16/vol73/num07/Standardized-Tests@-Purpose-Is-the-Point.aspx|journal=Educational Leadership|volume=73|issue=7|page=47|last1=Popham|first1=W. James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the information presented above, students undergoing the testing have been told to not spend copious amounts of their own time to study and prepare for the tests, although students believe they need to do well to ensure they don't let down their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/blog/2015/11/standardized-tests-can-be-smarter.html|title=Standardized Tests Can Be Smarter {{!}} RAND|last=S.|first=Hamilton, Laura|last2=M.|first2=Stecher, Brian|website=www.rand.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized tests put large amounts of pressure on students. Some children who are considered at the top of their class choke when it comes to standardized tests such as the citywide.

=== Reflection of testing ===
Parents and community activists around the country explain that the education system is failing students. Standardized testing is included in efforts to improve the education system. Standardized testing gives a detailed account of student improvement and teacher effectiveness is evaluated, which can show how the school's effectiveness sits on a national scale.

==Public policy==
Standardized testing is used as a [[Public policy (law)|public policy]] strategy to establish stronger accountability measures for public [[education]].  While the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has served as an educational barometer for some thirty years by administering standardized tests on a regular basis to random schools throughout the United States, efforts over the last decade at the state and federal levels have mandated annual standardized test administration for all public schools across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/|title=NAEP Nations Report Card - National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind the standardized testing policy movement is that testing is the first step to improving schools, teaching practice, and educational methods through data collection.  Proponents argue that the data generated by the standardized tests act like a [[report card]] for the community, demonstrating how well local schools are performing.  Critics of the movement, however, point to various discrepancies that result from current state standardized testing practices, including problems with test validity and reliability and false correlations (see [[Simpson's paradox]]).

Critics also charge that standardized tests encourage "[[teaching to the test]]" at the expense of creativity and in-depth coverage of subjects not on the test. Multiple choice tests are criticized for failing to assess skills such as writing. Furthermore, student's success is being tracked to a teacher's relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher's success with a student's academic performance. Ethical and economical questions arise for teachers when faced with clearly underperforming or underskilled students and a standardized test.

Critics also object to the type of material that is typically tested by schools.  Although standardized tests for non-academic attributes such as the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] exist, schools rarely give standardized tests to measure initiative, creativity, imagination, curiosity, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Case Against Standardized Testing: Rising the Scores, Ruining the Schools|last=Kohn|first=Alfie|publisher=Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=0325003254|location=361 Hanover Street Portsmouth, NH 03801-3912|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the tests given by schools tend to focus less on moral or character development, and more on individual identifiable academic skills.

==Advantages==
* '''Offers guidance to teachers.''' Standardized tests will allow teachers to see how their students are performing compared to others in the country. This will help them revise their teaching methods if necessary to help their students meet the standards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oxfordlearning.com/pros-cons-of-standardized-tests/|title=Pros &amp; Cons of Standardized Tests {{!}} Oxford Learning|date=2014-10-29|work=Oxford Learning|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Allows students to see own progress.''' Students will be given the opportunity to reflect on their scores and see where their strengths as well as weaknesses are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Provide parents information about their child.''' The scores can allow parents to get an idea about how their child is doing academically compared to everyone else of the same age in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worklife.columbia.edu/files_worklife/public/Pros_and_Cons_of_Standardized_Testing_1.pdf|title=Pros and Cons of Standardized Testing|last=|first=|date=Spring 2013|website=Columbia University|access-date=February 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127224837/http://worklife.columbia.edu/files_worklife/public/Pros_and_Cons_of_Standardized_Testing_1.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lets government know what areas need to be improved.''' Tests that are taken by everyone can help the government determine where students are struggling the most. With this information, they can implement solutions to fix the issue, allowing students to learn and grow in an academic environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the main advantages of standardized testing is that the results can be empirically documented; therefore, the test scores can be shown to have a relative degree of [[Validity (psychometric)|validity]] and [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], as well as results which are generalizable and replicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuncel | first1 = N. R. | last2 = Hezlett | first2 = S. A. | year = 2007 | title =  ASSESSMENT: Standardized Tests Predict Graduate Students' Success| url = | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5815| pages = 1080–81 | doi=10.1126/science.1136618 | pmid=17322046}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often contrasted with grades on a school transcript, which are assigned by individual teachers.  It may be difficult to account for differences in educational culture across schools, difficulty of a given teacher's curriculum, differences in teaching style, and techniques and biases that affect grading.  This makes standardized tests useful for admissions purposes in higher education, where a school is trying to compare students from across the nation or across the world. Examples of such international benchmark tests include the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ([[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMMS]]) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ([[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study|PIRLS]]). Performance on these exams have been speculated to change based on the way standards like the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) line up with top countries across the world.

There are three metrics by which the best performing countries in the TIMMS (the "A+ countries") are measured: focus, coherence, and rigor. Focus is defined as the number of topics covered in each grade; the idea is that the fewer topics covered in each grade, the more focus can be given to each topic. The definition of coherence is adhering to a sequence of topics covered that follows the natural progression or logical structure of mathematics. The CCSSM was compared to both the current state standards and the A+ country standards. With the most number of topics covered on average, the current state standards had the lowest focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = William H. | last2 = Houang | first2 = Richard T. | year = 2012 | title = Curricular Coherence and the Common Core Standards for Mathematics | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/content/41/8/294.abstract | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 41 | issue = 8| pages = 294–308 | doi=10.3102/0013189x12464517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core Standards aim to fix this discrepancy by helping educators focus on what students need to learn instead of becoming distracted by extraneous topics. They encourage educational materials to go from covering a vast array of topics in a shallow manner to a few topics in much more depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porter | first1 = A. | last2 = McMaken | first2 = J. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = J. | last4 = Yang | first4 = R. | year = 2011 | title = Common Core Standards: The New U.S. Intended Curriculum | doi = 10.3102/0013189x11405038 | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 103–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized tests also remove teacher bias in assessment. Research shows that teachers create a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in their assessment of students, granting those they anticipate will achieve with higher scores and giving those who they expect to fail lower grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Jussim | year = 1989 | title = Teacher expectations: Self-fulfilling prophecies, perceptual bias, and accuracy | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.469| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 469–480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage is aggregation. A well designed standardized test provides an assessment of an individual's mastery of a domain of knowledge or skill which at some level of aggregation will provide useful information. That is, while individual assessments may not be accurate enough for practical purposes, the mean scores of classes, schools, branches of a company, or other groups may well provide useful information because of the reduction of error accomplished by increasing the sample size.

Opponents claim that standardized tests are misused and uncritical judgments of intelligence and performance, but supporters argue that these aren't negatives of standardized tests, but criticisms of poorly designed testing regimes. They argue that testing should and does focus educational resources on the most important aspects of education&amp;nbsp;— imparting a pre-defined set of knowledge and skills&amp;nbsp;— and that other aspects are either less important, or should be added to the testing scheme.

==Disadvantages and criticism==
* '''Validity, efficacy, and predictive power.''' Many contend that overuse and misuse of these tests harms teaching and learning by narrowing the curriculum. According to the group [[FairTest]], when standardized tests are the primary factor in accountability, schools use the tests to narrowly define curriculum and focus instruction. Accountability creates an immense pressure to perform and this can lead to the misuse and misinterpretation of standardized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holloway | first1 = J. H. | year = 2001 | title = The Use and Misuse of Standardized Tests | url = | journal = Educational Leadership | volume = 59 | issue = 1| page = 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FairTest says that negative consequences of test misuse include narrowing the curriculum, teaching to the test, pushing students out of school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and school climate. Critics say that "[[teaching to the test]]" disfavors higher-order learning; it transforms what the teachers are allowed to be teaching and heavily limits the amount of other information students learn throughout the years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&amp;u=jcl_jccc&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;EJ3010692244&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=Standardized Testing Is Harming Student Learning|last=Williams|first=Mary|date=2015|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to use a standardized test without letting its contents determine curriculum and instruction, frequently, what is not tested is not taught, and how the subject is tested often becomes a model for how to teach the subject. 
** Uncritical use of standardized test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate [[intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Why Standardized Test Scores Don't Measure Educational Quality|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar99/vol56/num06/Why-Standardized-Tests-Don't-Measure-Educational-Quality.aspx|journal=Educational Leadership|volume=56|issue=6|pages=8–15|last1=Popham|first1=W.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school only has control over one of these three factors. [[Value-added modeling]] has been proposed to cope with this criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;Hassel, B. &amp; Rosch, J. (2008) "Ohio Value-Added Primer." Fordham Foundation.  http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/Ohio_Value_Added_Primer_FINAL_small.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status.  The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.
**Some teachers would argue that Standardized Test only measures a student’s current knowledge and it does not reflect the students progress from the beginning of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pros and Cons of Standardized Testing|url=https://www.everettsd.org/cms/lib07/WA01920133/Centricity/Domain/2847/Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Standardized%20Testing.pdf| publisher=Columbia University|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A result created by individuals that are not a part of the student's regular instruction, but by professionals that determine what students should know at different ages. In addition, teachers agree that the best test creator and facilitator are themselves. They argue that they are the most aware of students abilities, capacities, and necessities which would allow them to take a longer on subjects or proceed on with the regular curriculum. 
* '''Notable Opponents'''. In her book,  ''Now You See It'', [[Cathy Davidson]] criticizes standardized tests. She describes our youth as "assembly line kids on an assembly line model," meaning the use of the standardized test as a part of a one-size-fits-all educational model. She also criticizes the narrowness of skills being tested and labeling children without these skills as failures or as students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Cathy|title=Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn|year=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread and organized cheating has been a growing culture in today's reformation of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/25/15430647-cheating-scandal-feds-say-teachers-hired-stand-in-to-take-their-certification-tests?lite|title=Cheating scandal: Feds say teachers hired stand-in to take their certification tests|author=U.S. News|date=2 May 2015|work=NBC News|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]] has commented on the limitations of the standardized test, writing that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]],'' [[Jonathan Kozol]] argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of "cognitive decapitation."  Kozol comes to this realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the contest of the mandated tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America|last = Kozol|first = Jonathan|publisher = Random House|year = 2005|isbn = 9781415924167|location = Print|pages = 118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Teachers are severely impacted on the success of their students' scores. In some cases, they have their entire career put on the line with how well their students' are testing. Up to half of a teacher's salary will be tied to how her students perform on the tests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
** Schools that score poorly wind up being slated for closure or downsizing, which gives direct influence on the administration to result to dangerous tactics such as intimidation, cheating and drilling of information to raise scores.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Testing Minorities.''' Monty Neill, the director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, claims that students who speak English as a second language, who have a disability, or who come from low-income families are disproportionately denied a diploma due to a test score, which is unfair and harmful. In the late 1970s when the graduation test began in the United States, for example, a lawsuit delayed that many Black students had not had a fair opportunity on the material they were tested on the graduation test because they had attended schools segregated by law. “The interaction of under-resourced schools and testing most powerfully hits students of color”, as Neill argues, “They are disproportionately denied diplomas or grade promotion, and the schools they attend are the ones most likely to fare poorly on the tests and face sanctions such as restructuring.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=Monty|title=Standardized Tests Are Unfair and Harmful|date=Fall 2009|publisher=Farmington Hills, MI : Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780737747812|pages=28–35|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/EJ3010692217/OVIC?u=puya65247&amp;xid=782577cf|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the journal ''The Progressive,'' Barbara Miner explicates the drawbacks of standardized testing by analyzing three different books. As the co-director of the Center for Education at Rice University and a professor of education, Linda M. McNeil in her book ''Contradictions of School Reform: Educational Costs of Standardized Testing'' writes “Educational standardization harms teaching and learning and, over the long term, restratifies education by race and class.” McNeil believes that test-based education reform places higher standards for students of color. According to Miner, McNeil “shows how test-based reform centralizes power in the hands of the corporate and political elite-- a particularly frightening development during this time of increasing corporate and conservative influence over education reform.” Such test-based reform has dumbed down learning, especially for students of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miner|first1=Barbara|title=Standardized Minds: The High Price of America's Testing Culture and what we can do to Change it / Contradictions of School Reform: Educational Costs of Standardized Testing..|journal=The Progressive|date=August 2000|volume=64|pages=40–43|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/231959849?accountid=2280|accessdate=4 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''On a student and educator level.''' There is criticism from students themselves that tests, while standardized, are unfair to the individual student. Some students are "bad test takers", meaning they get nervous and unfocused on tests. Therefore, while the test is standard and should provide fair results, the test takers are at a disadvantage, but have no way to prove their knowledge otherwise, as there is no other testing alternative that allows students to prove their knowledge and problem-solving skills. 
** Some students suffer from [[test anxiety]]. Test anxiety applies to standardized tests as well, where students who may not have test anxiety regularly feel immense pressure to perform when the stakes are so high. High stakes standardized testing includes exams like the SAT, the PARCC, and the ACT, where doing well is required for grade passing or college admission.
** Standardized tests are a way to measure the education level of students and schools on a broad scale. From Kindergarten to 12th grade, students participate in required test taking.  In that amount of time, the average student takes 112 standardized tests, which equates to about 10 tests per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/study-says-standardized-testing-is-overwhelming-nations-public-schools/2015/10/24/8a22092c-79ae-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html|title=Study says standardized testing is overwhelming nation's public schools|last=Layton|first=Lyndsey|date=October 24, 2015|website=The Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this rate, the average amount of testing takes about 2.3% of total class time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/24/obama-schools-test/74536886/|title=Obama plan limits standardized testing to no more than 2% of class time|last=Doering|first=Christopher|date=October 25, 2015|website=USA Today|publisher=|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although standardized tests were designed to improve the education system, they are creating many negative effects on students and teachers.

With the relationship between teachers and students, the school system is advocating for the break down of communities and fostering competition. Educators are wanting to raise test scores by teaching to the test and only working on their own students. Avoiding work with fellow teachers allows for them to look better compared to the ones next to them if they do successfully raise scores, it gives room for them to shine, letting go of the idea of community. The competition gives way for an unhealthy environment that's placed in the school setting, and could be damaging to the students by limiting the information they are given, and maybe different ways to go about solving and interpreting certain questions/problems.

Standardized tests have caused the quality and depth of the educational curriculum to diminish (Rooks, Noliwe, and Noliwe Rooks). Instead of teachers developing a curriculum that addresses the needs of the actual students in their classrooms, they end up using the required material which they did not take any part in creating. The required material often contains pacing guidelines which regulate when substance should be taught and scripted lessons which often limits the teacher’s abilities to make relevant decisions in a classroom.
	The tests have narrowed the curriculum to a lot of schools, usually squeezing out classes such as art and music simply because they are excluded in the tests, then they are wiped out of the curriculum. Teachers are then forced to teach subjects that only influence the literacy level and comprehension ability of a student and leave out the ones that often require talent or skill.

Standardized testing places a lot of stress and pressure on children and teachers. Teachers are put under a lot of stress because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive. This causes teachers to teach to the test rather than teach to the life skills children will  use and need. In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this and the removal of a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. Teachers do not get the results back until the end of the summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress on teachers and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.

* Standardized testing puts pressure not only on students, but on teachers as well. New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] has proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to "teach to the test," but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform calls for performance-based pay that depends on students' performances on standardized tests and their educational gains. However, students vary based on cognitive, developmental, and psychological abilities, so it is unfair to teachers with students with difficulties on the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/06/christie_education_speech_in_iowa.html#incart_2box_politics_index.ssf|title=Christie Education Speech in Iowa|last=Arco|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2015|website=NJ.com|publisher=|access-date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an April 1995 "meta-analysis" published in the Journal of Educational and Psychological Measurement, Todd Morrison and Melanie Morrison examined two dozen validity studies of the test required to get into just about any Masters or PhD program in America: the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). This study encompassed more than 5,000 test-takers over the past 30 years. The authors found that GRE scores accounted for just 6 percent of the variation in grades in graduate school. The GRE appears to be "virtually useless from a prediction standpoint," wrote the authors. Repeated studies of the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) find the same. The SAT's maker, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), now claims the SAT is not an "aptitude" test but rather an assessment of "developed abilities."&lt;ref&gt;Todd Morrison and Melanie Morrison. "A Meta-Analytic Assessment of the Predictive Validity..." Journal of Educational and Psychological Measurement. 1995. Componentshttp://epm.sagepub.com/content/55/2/309.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, standardized tests are not inexpensive.  It has been reported that the United States spends about 1.7 billion dollars annually on these tests.&lt;ref&gt;Kuczynski-Brown, Alex. "Standardized Testing Costs States $1.7 Billion A Year, Study Finds." The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, 29 November 2012. Web. 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was also reported that only three companies (Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill and Riverside Publishing) design 96% of the tests taken at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/testing/companies.html|title = The Testing Industry's Big Four|date = 2001|accessdate = 2015-01-21|website = PBS Frontline|publisher = PBS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational decisions==
Test scores are in some cases used as a sole, mandatory, or primary criterion for admissions or certification.  For example, some U.S. states require [[high school graduation examination]]s.  Adequate scores on these exit exams are required for high school graduation.  The [[General Educational Development]] test is often used as an alternative to a high school diploma.

Other applications include tracking (deciding whether a student should be enrolled in the "fast" or "slow" version of a course) and awarding scholarships.  In the United States, many colleges and universities automatically translate scores on [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] tests into college credit, satisfaction of graduation requirements, or placement in more advanced courses.  Generalized tests such as the [[SAT]] or [[GRE]] are more often used as one measure among several, when making admissions decisions.  Some public institutions have cutoff scores for the SAT, [[GPA]], or class rank, for creating classes of applicants to automatically accept or reject.

Heavy reliance on standardized tests for decision-making is often controversial, for the reasons noted above.  Critics often propose emphasizing cumulative or even non-numerical measures, such as classroom grades or brief individual assessments (written in prose) from teachers.  Supporters argue that test scores provide a clear-cut, objective standard that serves as a valuable check on [[grade inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The National Academy of Sciences recommends that major educational decisions not be based solely on a single test score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/html/highstakes/|title=Browse All Topics – The National Academies Press|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of minimum cut-scores for entrance or graduation does not imply a single standard, since test scores are nearly always combined with other minimal criteria such as number of credits, prerequisite courses, attendance, etc.  Test scores are often perceived as the "sole criteria" simply because they are the most difficult, or the fulfillment of other criteria is automatically assumed.  One exception to this rule is the [[GED]], which has allowed many people to have their skills recognized even though they did not meet traditional criteria.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

'''Synchronous learning''' refers to a [[learning]] event in which a group of students are engaging in learning at the same time. Before [[learning technology]] allowed for synchronous learning environments, most online education took place through [[asynchronous learning]] methods. Since synchronous tools that can be used for education have become available, many people are turning to them as a way to help decrease the challenges associated with [[transactional distance]] that occurs in online education. Several case studies&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, S. (2002). Socialization in the "virtual hallway": instant messaging in the asynchronous web-based distance education classroom. The Internet and Higher Education, 5(4), 363-372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oztok, M., Zingaro, D., Brett, C., &amp; Hewitt, J. (2013). Exploring asynchronous and synchronous tool use in online courses. Computers &amp; Education, 60(1), 87-94. See page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwier, R. A., &amp; Balbar, S. (2002). The interplay of content and community in synchronous and asynchronous communication: Virtual communication in a graduate seminar. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology/La revue canadienne de l'apprentissage et de la technologie, 28(2). Available at http://www.cjlt.ca/index.php/cjlt/article/view/81/74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hrastinski, S. (2006). The relationship between adopting a synchronous medium and participation in online group work: An explorative study. Interactive Learning Environments, 14(2), 137-152.&lt;/ref&gt;
that found that students are able to develop a sense of community over online synchronous communication platforms.

While many online educational programs started out as and with the advent of web conferencing tools, people can learn at the same time in different places as well. For example, use of instant messaging or live chat, webinars and video conferencing allow for students and teachers to collaborate and learn in real time.

==Practical applications==
A lecture is an example of synchronous learning in a face-to-face environment, because learners and teachers are all in the same place at the same time. Another example of a synchronous learning event would involve students watching a live web stream of a class, while simultaneously taking part in a discussion. Synchronous learning can be facilitated by having students and instructors participate in a class via a [[web conferencing]] tool. These synchronous experiences can be designed to develop and strengthen instructor-student and student-student relationships, which can be a challenge in distance learning programs.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, P. (2010). Distance supervision: Research, findings, and considerations for art therapy. The Arts in Psychotherapy, 37, 106-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Synchronous communication in distance education began long before the advent of the use of computers in synchronous learning. After the very early days of distance education, when students and instructors communicated asynchronously via the post office, synchronous forms of communication in distance education emerged with broadcast radio and television.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, R. M., Abrami, P. C., Lou, Y., Borokhovski, E., Wade, A., Wozney, L., Wallet, P., Fiset, M., &amp; Huang, B. (2004). How does distance education compare with classroom instruction? A meta-analysis of the empirical literature. Review of educational research, 74(3), 379-439&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1980s, with video-conferencing and interactive television, that students could ask questions and discuss concepts while seeing participants in a synchronous setting. Manifestations of interactive multimedia, the Internet, access to Web-based resources, to synchronous and asynchronous forms of computer mediated communication followed in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. M. (2006). Synchronous and asynchronous text-based CMC in educational contexts: A review of recent research. TechTrends, 50(4), 46-53.&lt;/ref&gt; (Bernard, et al., 2005; Simonson, et al., 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;37).

'''Thematic teaching''' (also known as '''thematic instruction''') is the selecting and highlighting of a theme through an instructional unit or module, course, multiple courses. It is often interdisciplinary, highlighting the relationship of knowledge across academic disciplines and everyday life. Themes can be topics or take the form of overarching questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Vacation and Etiquette Themes in Social Studies, Primary Source Inquiry for Middle and High School|last=Resor|first=Cynthia Williams|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4758-3198-6|location=Maryland|pages=10-11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic learning is closely related to [[Interdisciplinary teaching|interdisciplinary]] or integrated instruction, topic-, [[Project-based learning|project-]] or [[phenomenon-based learning]].  Thematic teaching is commonly associated with elementary classrooms and middle schools using a team-based approach, but this pedagogy is equally relevant in secondary schools and with adult learners. Thematic instruction assumes students learn best when they can associate new information holistically with across the entire curriculum and with their own  lives, experiences, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Steps==
Under the thematic learning instruction, organization of curriculum can be based on Macro or Micro theme depending upon the topic to be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* '''Choosing a theme:''' Themes should be of interest to students and relevant to the curriculum. In some situations, students can choose the thematic topic. Themes should also be topics of interest to the teacher(s) because successful thematic instructions often requires additional research and preparation. Interdisciplinary themes related to multiple academic disciplines such as science, social studies, math, language/writing, and other courses or subjects can be reinforced in lessons throughout the school day.
**Themes relevant to students' interests encourage active participation. For example, students may express interest in current popular music. This interest can be developed into thematic instructional units and lessons that span across time and cultures, how cultures interact and impact one another, music as a social or political commentary in social studies or history classes.
**Themes allowing past to present connections and highlight persistent issued faced by society such as war, poverty, pollution, disease, or natural disasters are especially effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Vacation and Etiquette Themes in Social Studies, Primary Source Inquiry for Middle and High School|last=Resor|first=Cynthia Williams|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4758-3198-6|location=Maryland|pages=93-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Doing the research:''' Effective interdisciplinary thematic instruction requires extensive knowledge and research by the teacher. Without a broad knowledge base on which to design relevant activities and lessons, thematic lessons can become randomly selected activities loosely related to a topic that fail to demand higher level thinking from students.
*'''Design an essential question(s) relevant to the theme.''' Essential questions are open-ended, intellectually engaging questions that demand higher-order thinking. Essential questions focus a thematic inquiry, helping the teacher chose the most important facts and concepts relative to the theme and focus planning efforts. For students, essential questions require student both learn the key facts and concepts related to the theme as well as analyze and evaluate the importance and relevance of that information. Good essential questions can not be answered with a simple yes/no or true/false; students must discuss, defend, and debate issues related to the theme. Designing thematic instruction around essential questions requires that students learn both content and develop critical analysis skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/109004/chapters/What-Makes-a-Question-Essential%A2.aspx|title=What Makes a Question Essential?|last=McTighe|last2=Wiggins|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Designing instructional units and activities that guide students in answering the essential question'''. Teachers must choose teaching and learning strategies, activities, classroom materials, and experiences related to the wider theme and guide students in answering the essential question. Strategies can be individual or cooperative;stress various skills such as reading, writing, or presenting. 

==Curriculum==
For thematic learning to be successful among learners, the following should be considered: 
* Thematic learning consists of a curriculum that is unified and dwells on an identified theme or topic, ideally guided by essential questions.
* The sources are not limited to textbooks. For example, in the social studies or history classroom, primary source texts and images encourage the development of critical reading skills. For themes related to current events, analysis of modern media hones [[media literacy]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Investigating Family, Food, and Housing Themes in Social Studies|last=Resor|first=Cynthia Williams|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4758-3202-0|location=Maryland|pages=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Various teaching and learning methods can be used. Projects, cooperative learning, active participation, [[experiential learning]] are often highlighted. 
* Thinking and problem solving skills, observation, critical reasoning, analysis and drawing conclusions are key skills in thematic learning.&lt;ref name="Seefeldt2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Seefeldt|title=How to Work with Standards in the Early Childhood Classroom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaAuwVyhVV8C&amp;pg=PA47|year=2005|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=978-0-8077-4587-8|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

* Students learn better when experiencing knowledge in a larger context. They begin to see relationships and connections across time, place, and disciplines.
* Learning about wider themes and related concepts and facts more closely resembles how life is experienced outside of school and the classroom.
* Themes can be chosen that are current and student-centered, incorporating the needs, interests and perspectives of the students. 
* Carefully selecting topics and information related to a theme helps teachers narrow the overwhelming amount of information of any discipline.
* Thematic instructions aligns with current popular pedagogies and standards including place-based education, project-based education, and cooperative learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teachingwiththemes.com/index.php/thematic-instruction/|title=Thematic Instruction in the Social Studies Classroom|last=|first=|date=|website=Teaching With Themes, Social History through Primary Sources|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When thematic instruction takes place along with cooperative learning, the advantages include the following:
** Thematic cooperative learning activities encourage authentic communication.
** The learner shares one's ideas with others in the group.
** Interaction encourages the values of respect and cooperation, thus building effective peer learning groups.
**The teacher becomes the facilitator, reduces the role of dispenser of learning.&lt;ref name="Thematic Integration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paterson.k12.nj.us/departments/curr/curriculum/FCS-TED/Column%20I%20NJCCCS9.1-FCS/Thematic%20Integration%20-%20FCS.pdf|title=Thematic Integration|website=www.paterson.k12.nj.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the 1977 decision of the [[US District Court]] of New Jersey that a course in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) was religious activity within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and that the government funded teaching of SCI/TM in the New Jersey public high schools was prohibited.&lt;ref name="conlaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="malnak"/&gt; The court ruled that, although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions. The court found that the religious nature of the course was clear from careful examination of the textbook, the expert testimony elicited, and the uncontested facts concerning the puja ceremony, which it found involved "offerings to deities as part of a regularly scheduled course in the schools' educational programs".&lt;ref&gt;The TM puja ceremony is described in the opinion of the US District Court in Malnak v Yogi, including the [[Sanskrit]] chant and the English translation thereof from the book "The Holy Tradition", written by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.&lt;/ref&gt; State action was involved because the SCI/TM course and activities involved the teaching of a religion, without an objective secular purpose.&lt;ref name="malnak" /&gt; According to religious scholar [[Cynthia Ann Humes]] the ''Malnak'' decision "dismantled" the TM program's use of government funding to incorporate Transcendental Meditation into public schools.&lt;ref name=Forsthoefel/&gt; However, according to religious scholars [[Douglas E. Cowan]] and [[David G. Bromley]] this "judicial rebuff" of the New Jersey school project did not render "a negative evaluation of the program itself" and those who oppose the practice in public schools are said to be mainly conservative Christians and civil libertarians who seek to preserve church-state separation.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2008 70"/&gt;

====USA Reception====
[[University of South Carolina]] sociologist Barry Markovsky described the TM technique in schools as "stealth religion",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtrnews.com/greater-tulsa-reporter/753/once-grand-camelot-hotel-had-a-quick-demise ''Man Fails To Fly, Sues Camelot Hotel Owner''], ''GTR News Online'', Nancy K. Owens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry W. Lynn]], executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], says Transcendental Meditation is rooted in Hinduism and crosses the same constitutional line as in the ''Malnak'' case and decision of 1979. Since then, however, "TM has made a comeback of sorts with some governmental sponsorship" according to authors Forsthoefel and Humes.{{sfn|Forsthoefel|2005|p=66}} In May 2008, Lynn said that the Americans United for Separation of Church and State was keeping "a close legal eye on the TM movement" and "there are no imminent cases" against the movement.&lt;ref name=Conant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek08/&gt; At the same time, Brad Dacus of the [[Pacific Justice Institute]] says doing Transcendental Meditation during a school's "quiet time" (a short period of school time for private prayer or relaxation) "is constitutional."&lt;ref name="Conant2008-05-29"/&gt;

According to a 2008 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, there is a "growing movement to bring Transcendental Meditation... into more U.S. schools as a stress-buster for America's overwhelmed kids".&lt;ref name=Newsweek08/&gt; At the same time, critics say that Transcendental Meditation is a revised form of Eastern, religious philosophy, and they oppose its use in public schools.&lt;ref name=Conant/&gt; Some parents and critics view it as an overstepping of boundaries that could lead to "lifelong personal and financial servitude to a corporation run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi".&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;Williamson (2010) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many parents feel the meditation has created "profound results" for their children, and that they "hardly view TM as exclusively, or even overtly, religious," and advocates describe it is a physiological technique that calms the mind, improves grades and attention span, while reducing disruptive behavior.&lt;ref name=Conant/&gt; A 2011 research review said their "findings provide good support for the use of TM to enhance several forms of information processing in students".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Shauna |last1=Shapiro |first2=Kirk |last2=Brown |first3=John |last3=Astin |title=Toward the Integration of Meditation into Higher Education: A Review of Research Evidence |journal=Teachers College Record |volume=113 |issue=3 |date=March 2011 |pages=495–528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tutor spends a few hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to transfer their expertise on the topic or skill to the student. Tutoring can take place in different settings, such as a classroom, a formal tutoring center, or the home of the tutor/learner. As a teaching-learning method, tutoring is characterized by how it differs from formal teaching methods on the basis of the (in)formality of the setting as well as the flexibility in pedagogical methods in terms of duration, pace of teaching, evaluation and tutor-tutee rapport.

==History==
Tutoring began as an informal and unstructured method of educational assistance, dating back to periods in Ancient Greece. Tutors operated on an ad-hoc or impromptu basis in varied and unfixed settings wherein the main goal of the tutor was to impart knowledge to the learner in order to help the latter gain proficiency in the subject area. Methods of tutoring only began to become more structured after the 20th century through focus and specialisation in the training of tutors, application of tutoring, and evaluation of tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ralph III, Michele M. Nobel, Terri Hessler, Christopher D. Yawn, and Timothy E. Heron. “Tutoring System Innovations: Past Practice to Future Prototypes.” ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic'' 43, no. 2 (November 2007): 71–81. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/10534512070430020701&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 20th century onwards, with the rapid spread of mainstream education, the demand for tutoring has also increased as a way to supplement formal education.

==British and Irish secondary schools==

{{see also|Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)}}

In [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[secondary school]]s, ''form tutors'' are given the responsibilities of a [[form (education)|form]] or [[class (education)|class]] of [[student]]s in a particular year group (up to 30 students). They usually work in year teams headed by a year leader, year head, or guidance teacher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Form tutors will provide parents with most of the information about their child's progress and any problems they might be experiencing. Ordinarily, the form tutor is the person who contacts a parent if there is a problem at school; however, the year leader or guidance teacher may contact the parents, since the form tutor has full-time responsibility as a specialist subject teacher.

==Private tutoring in Asia==

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]] pointed out that private tutoring can dominate the lives of young people and their families, maintain and exacerbate social inequalities, divert needed household income into an unregulated industry, and create inefficiencies in education systems. It can also undermine official statements about fee-free education and create threats to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/news/adb-study-highlights-dark-side-shadow-education ADB Study Highlights Dark Side of 'Shadow Education'], Shadow Education: Private Supplementary Tutoring and its Implications for Policy Makers in Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, nearly 90% of elementary students receive some sort of shadow education.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Keun. 2010. "Educational Equality", in Lee, Chong Jae; Kim, Seong-yul &amp; Adams, Don (eds.), Sixty Years of Korean Education. Seoul: Seoul National University Press, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong, about 85% of senior secondary students do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klncc.caritas.org.hk/private/document/644.pdf], Caritas, Community &amp; Higher Education Service. 2010. Private Supplementary Tutoring of Secondary Students: Investigation Report. Hong Kong: Caritas.&lt;/ref&gt; 60% of primary students in West Bengal, India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pratham.org/aser08/ASER_2010_Report.pdf.], Pratham. 2011. Annual Status of Education Report 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of secondary students in Kazakhstan receive private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Kalikova, Saule &amp; Zhanar Rakhimzhanova. 2009. "Private Tutoring in Kazakhstan", in Silova, Iveta (Ed.), Private Supplementary Tutoring in Central Asia: New Opportunities and Burdens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for tutoring in Asia is exploding; by comparison globally, shadow education is most extensive in Asia. This is partly due to the stratification of education systems, cultural factors, perceptions of shortcomings in regular school systems, and the combination of growing wealth and smaller family sizes.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Therefore, the education sector has become a profitable industry which businesses have created different kinds of products and advertisement such us "the king/queen of tutorial", a usual advertisement tactic of Hong Kong tutorial centers that has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India where tutors achieve "celebrity-like status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Yojana|title=Meet the 'tutor kings and queens'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-20085558|accessdate=14 June 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, successful Southeast Asian tutors will even embrace the title of "tutor". Online private tutor matching platform and online learning platform offering online learning materials are other creations.

In Cambodia, most tutoring is provided by teachers,&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter"&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Mass Schooling in East Asia: Reflections of Inequality in Japan, South Korea, and Cambodia." Asia Pacific Education Review 11(1):14-24.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Hong Kong, it is provided by individuals, small companies or large companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/article/facing-shadow-education-system-hong-kong], Kwo, Ora &amp; Mark Bray. 2011. "Facing the Shadow Education System in Hong Kong." IIAS Newsletter (University of Leiden, International Institute for Asian Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia, most tutoring is labor-intensive,&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Alison, Batjargal Ayush, Bolormaa Tsetsgee, &amp; Tumendelger Sengedorj. 2006. "Mongolia". In Iveta Silova, Virginija Būdienė, &amp; Mark Bray (Eds.), Education in a Hidden Marketplace: Monitoring of Private Tutoring. New York: Open Society Institute, pp.257-277&lt;/ref&gt; while entrepreneurs in South Korea make use of computers and other forms of technology.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

===Policy===

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong recommended policymakers across the region take a closer look at how ‘shadow education’ affects family budgets, children's time, and national education systems. It suggested that in order to reduce the need for private lessons, improvements in mainstream schools should be made. Regulations are also needed to protect consumers.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

==Costs of tutoring==

Some studies have estimated costs associated with "shadow education". In [[Pakistan]], expenditures on tutoring per child averaged $3.40 a month in 2011. In [[India]], average spending was lower, but still equated to about $2 per month.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Monazza &amp; Paul Atherton. 2011. "The "Shadow" Education Sector in India and Pakistan: The Determinants, Benefits and Equity Effects of Private Tutoring." Presentation at the UKFIET (United Kingdom Forum for International Education and Training) Conference, University of Oxford, 13–15 September.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, household expenditures for private tutoring at the secondary school level was $48 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;EPPM (International Institute of Education Policy, Planning &amp; Management). 2011. Study of Private Tutoring in Georgia. Tbilisi: EPPM, p.29. (In Georgian)&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hong Kong, the business of providing private tutoring to secondary schools reached $255 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Synovate Limited. 2011. Marketing survey of tutoring businesses in Hong Kong, cited in Modern Education Group Limited (2011), Global Offering (for stock market launch), Hong Kong, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a 2008 survey estimated the size of the private tutoring sector to be $6.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Vora, Nikhil &amp; Shweta Dewan. 2009. Indian Education Sector: Long Way from Graduation!. Mumbai: IDFC-SSK Securities Ltd., p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], families spent $12 billion in 2010 on private tutoring.&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, where the government has attempted to cool down the private tutoring market, shadow education costs have continually grown, reaching a staggering $17.3 billion in 2010. Household expenditures on private tutoring are equivalent to about 80% of government expenditures on public education for primary and secondary students.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sunwoong &amp; Ju-Ho Lee. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Demand for Education in South Korea." Economic Development and Cultural Change 58(2), p.261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the tutoring market is fragmented. Some online tutoring marketplaces, however, have managed to aggregate a large number of private tutors on their platform and also tutoring data. For example, one such site has over 34,000 registered tutors in California and made public their tutoring hourly rate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutoring Rates in California: An Analysis of over 34,000 Private Tutors|url=http://www.findtutorsnearme.com/tutoring-rates-in-california-an-analysis-of-over-34000-private-tutors/|publisher=www.findtutorsnearme.com|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

In many countries, individuals can become tutors without training. In some countries, including Cambodia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, and Tajikistan, the pattern of classroom teachers supplementing their incomes by tutoring students after school hours is more a necessity than a choice, as many teachers’ salaries hover close to the poverty line.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, the number of private tutors expanded roughly 7.1% annually on average from 2001 to 2006, and by 2009 the sector was the largest employer of graduates from the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Min &amp; Daekwon Park. 2012. "Impacts of Urban Economic Factors on Private Tutoring Industry." Asia Pacific Education Review 13 (20), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private tutoring is not always effective in raising academic achievement; and in some schools students commonly skip classes or sleep through lessons because they are tired after excessive external study. This means that the shadow system can make regular schooling less efficient.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Teachers who spend more time focusing on private lessons than regular classes can cause greater inefficiencies in the mainstream school system. Situations in which teachers provide extra private lessons for pupils for whom they are already responsible in the public system can lead to corruption, particularly when teachers deliberately teach less in their regular classes in order to promote the market for private lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2009. "The Tricks of the Teacher: Shadow Education and Corruption in Cambodia", in Heyneman, Stephen P. (ed.), Buying Your Way into Heaven: Education and Corruption in International Perspective. Rotterdam: Sense Publishers, pp.51-74; Bray &amp; Lykins (2012), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

When private tutoring is provided by well trained tutor however the effects can be dramatic, with pupils improving performance by two standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. (1984). [http://web.mit.edu/bosworth/MacData/afs.course/5/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf "The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring"], Educational Researcher, 13:6(4-16).
&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem]].

==Types of tutoring==

There can be an existing overlap between different types of tutoring with respect to the setting or location of tutoring, the size of tutor-learner pairings/groups, and the method of tutoring provided, for example, one-on-one peer tutoring can take place through online tutoring. Tutoring is typically private since it is exists independent of the system of public and private education, that is, one can be enrolled in public/private schooling and attend private tutoring services.

=== Academic coaching ===
Academic coaching is a type of mentoring applied to academics.  Coaching involves a collaborative approach. Coaches try to help students learn how they best learn and how to operate in an academic environment. Tutors help students learn the material in individual courses while coaches help students learn how to be successful in school. In college, that includes such topics as: [[study skills]], time management, stress management, effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, and understanding how to use a syllabus. Academic coaches meet with the student regularly throughout the semester. Coaches work with students in all kinds of situations, not just those who are struggling academically.  Academic coaching is also serves to help students prepare for entrance exams to gain entry to schools or universities, and it is a particularly popular in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/asia/06iht-educlede06.html|title=Tutoring Spreads Beyond Asia's Wealthy|last=Gooch|first=Liz|date=2012-08-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in India, a majority of students, be it of any class or stream, visit a coaching center or a "study circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/143827.cms|title=Hey tutors! Leave us kids alone|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home-based tutoring===
{{Main|In-home tutoring}}
[[In-home tutoring]] is a form of tutoring that occurs in the home. Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation. This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs. The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil. Due to the informal and private nature of in-home tutoring, there is limited substantial or conclusive information on in-home tutoring.

===Online tutoring===
{{Main|Online tutoring}}[[Online tutoring]] is another way for a student to receive academic help, either scheduled or on-demand. Sessions are done through an application where a student and tutor can communicate. Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing, online videos and other specialized applets which make it easier to convey information back and forth. Online tutoring has relatively recently emerged as a mechanism to provide tutoring services in contrast to more traditional in-person teaching. One of the potential drawbacks of online tutoring stems from the influx or sensory overload of information from different materials. "For example, mate- rial presented in multiple modalities run the risk of interrupting the learner from a coherent learn- ing experience, of imposing a “split attention” effect (the mind cannot concentrate on two things simultaneously), or of overloading the learner's limited supply of cognitive resources."&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, John, and Paul Chandler. “Why Some Material Is Difficult to Learn.” ''Faculty of Education - Papers (Archive)'', January 1, 1994, 185–233. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532690xci1203_1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer tutoring ===
&lt;p&gt;Peer tutoring refers to the method of tutoring that involves members of the same peer group teaching or tutoring one another. The characteristics of a peer tutoring group/pairing vary across age, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity. It has been defined as "a class of practices and strategies that employs peers as one-on-one teachers to provide individualized instruction, practice, repetition, and clarification of concepts"&lt;ref&gt;Utley, C., Mortweet, S., &amp; Greenwood, C. (1997). Peer-mediated instruction and interventions. ''Focus on Exceptional Children'', ''29''(5), 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

=== Academic performance ===
Studies have found that peer tutoring provides academic benefits for learners across the subject areas of "reading, mathematics, science, and social studies"&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. 2018. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34 (1): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer tutoring has also been found to be an effective teaching method in enhancing the reading comprehension skills of students, especially that of students with a low academic performance at the secondary level in schools. Additionally, peer tutoring has been proven especially useful for those with learning disabilities at the elementary level, while there is mixed evidence showing the effectiveness of peer tutoring for those at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34, no. 1 (January 2, 2018): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effects ===
Although certain types of tutoring arrangements can require a salary for the tutor, typically tutoring is free of cost and thus financially affordable for learners. The cost-effectiveness of tutoring can prove to be especially beneficial for learners from low-income backgrounds or resource-strapped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Yang, George Loewenstein, and Yaojiang Shi. “Heterogeneous Effects of Peer Tutoring: Evidence from Rural Chinese Middle Schools.” Research in Economics 72 (March 1, 2018): 33–48. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rie.2017.05.002&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, paid tutoring arrangements can create or further highlight socioeconomic disparities between low-income, middle-income and high-income populations. A study found that access to private tutoring was less financially affordable for low-income families, who thus benefited less from private tutoring as compared to high-income populations, who had the resources to profit from private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Hsiao-Lei. “Private Tutoring, Wealth Constraint and Higher Education.” ''Pacific Economic Review'' 20, no. 4 (October 2015): 608–34. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0106.12122&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

=== Tutoring as "Shadow Education" ===
Tutoring has also emerged as a supplement to public and private schooling in many countries. The supplementary nature of tutoring is a feature in the domain of what some scholars have termed "shadow education".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bray, Mark. “Shadow Education: Comparative Perspectives on the Expansion and Implications of Private Supplementary Tutoring.” ''Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences'' 77 (April 2013): 412–20. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.096&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow education has been defined as "a set of educational activities that occur out side formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student's formal school career."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David Lee, and David P. Baker. “Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan.” ''American Journal of Sociology'' 97, no. 6 (1992): 1639–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "shadow" has four components to it: firstly, the existence of and need for tutoring is produced by the existence of the formal education system; secondly, the formal education system is the mainstream system and thus tutoring is its shadow; thirdly, the focus remains on mainstream education in schools; fourthly, tutoring is largely informal and unstructured as compared to formal or mainstream education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting the Shadow Education System: What Government Policies for What Private Tutoring?|last=Bray|first=Mark|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|year=2009|isbn=978-92-803-1333-8|location=Paris|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of the popularity of shadow education, private tutoring can sometimes overshadow mainstream education with more priority given to enrolling in private tutoring centers. Mark Bray claims that "Especially near the time of major external examinations, schools in some countries may be perceived by pupils to be less able to cater for their specific needs."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
