      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2274">'''Articles of partnership''' is a voluntary [[contract]] between/among two or more persons to place their [[Capital (economics)|capital]], labor, and skills into business, with the understanding that there will be a sharing of the profits and losses between/among partners.  Outside of North America, it is normally referred to simply as a '''partnership agreement'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |date=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |pages=191 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A partnership agreement is the written and legal agreement between/among business partners. It is always recommended but not essential for partners to have such an agreement.

==Articles of partnership==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Multiple sections are often included in articles of partnership, based on the circumstances:
* the granting of the partner the rights to manage and administer the business or a specific department.
* the authorization of a majority of partners to manage the affairs of the entire partnership. This is particularly common where there are numerous partners.
* provisions to account for, annually, the property and debts of the business.
* the forbidding of any partner to carry out business unrelated to the partnership. This is usually implied in articles of partnership.
* the allowance of expelling partners who commit gross misconduct or becomes [[insolvent]], [[bankrupt]], etc. This is particularly common where there are numerous partners.
* the submission of arguments to [[arbitration]].
* the allocation of business income and losses among partners.

The '''Association for Business Communication''' ('''ABC''') is  a  [[learned society]] for the field of [[business communication]]. Its mission statement states: "The Association for Business Communication (ABC) is an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship, research, education, and practice". The organization is [[interdisciplinary]], with members belonging to academic fields such as [[management]], [[marketing]], [[English language|English]], foreign languages, [[public speaking|speech]], [[communication]], [[linguistics]], and [[information systems]]. Additionally the organization brings together university academicians, business practitioners, and business consultants.

==Organizational structure==
ABC is an international organization, divided into nine regional divisions (Europe, Asia and Pacific Rim, Caribbean and Central America, and five North American regions: Canada plus Eastern, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western United States), each with its own separate academic conferences. Each year, the association holds an International Conference in October or November. Midyear, regional conferences are held—one in the European region and one or two of the North American regions. The Asia and Pacific Rim region holds a conference every two years or more frequently.

A [[board of directors]] and an [[executive committee]] lead the ABC. The board of directors is directly elected with a vice president elected from each of 9 regions and 12 directors at large, with staggered terms. The executive committee consists of a permanent position of executive director and four officers of the association. The members of the executive committee serve for four years in rotating capacity, beginning as second vice president in the first year, then first vice president the next, president the next, and past president the last year on the committee. The organization as a whole elects the second vice president position from among candidates on the board of directors.

The current executive director of the ABC is [[James M. Dubinsky]] ([[Virginia Tech]]). He took office in 2011.

For 2018-2019 the executive committee consists of President Lisa Gueldenzoph Snyder ([[North Carolina A &amp; T University]]), First Vice President Marcel Robles ([[Eastern Kentucky University]]), Second Vice President Geert Jacobs ([[Ghent University]]), and immediate Past President Deborah Roebuck ([[Kennesaw State University]]).

== Publications ==
Two [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]s, ''[[International Journal of Business Communication]]'' and the ''[[Business and Professional Communication Quarterly]]'' are published by [[SAGE Publications]] on behalf of ABC.

== Standing committees, ad hoc committees and interest groups ==

The ABC has standing committees, as follow:

    Academic Environment
    Business Practices
    Conference Procedures
    C.R. Anderson Research Fund
    Diversity and Inclusion
    Employment Opportunities
    Graduate Studies
    International Issues
    Marketing and Membership
    Modern Language Association Liaison (MLA)
    Nominating
    Publications Board
    Research
    Student Competition
    Teaching
    Technology
    Undergraduate Studies

The ABC has ad hoc committees for interests that have not yet warranted a standing committee, but may in the future become so. Many of the standing committees began as ad hoc committees. In 2017, the ABC had these ad hoc committees:

    Finance Committee
    National Communication Association Liaison
    Proceedings Editorial Review Board
    Vision/Mission Review Committee

Additionally, ABC members pursue a number of professional objectives through voluntary interest groups. A Special Interest Group may be convened by the First Vice President or by members’ current interest groups. In 2017, the ABC had the following Special Interest Groups:

    Business Writing and Speaking Centers
    Community College
    Consulting
    Intercultural Communication
    MBA
    Rhetoric
    Teaching with Technology


==History==

ABC was founded in 1936, beginning with a modest membership of 72 members, all but one from the United States (the only exception being from Canada). The organization, based at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], was then named the “Association of College Teachers of Business Writers.” The next year, 1937, that name changed to the “American Business Writing Association.”

By the 1960s, the field had grown considerably and became heavily interested in areas well beyond business writing (such as oral presentations, negotiations, and nonverbal communication among others). In 1967, the Board of Directors voted to change the name of the organization to the “American Business Communication Association” to reflect this change.

By the late 1970s, as the membership of the organization grew to include more members from outside the Americas and as the focus of research expanded heavily into the fields of intercultural communication and cross-cultural business communication practice, the term “American” became increasingly inaccurate of both the membership and focus of the organization. In 1985, the Board of Directors voted to change the name to its current “Association for Business Communication.”

In 1990, ABC moved its headquarters from [[Illinois]] first to the [[University of North Texas]] (1990–1994) and then to [[Baruch College]] [[CUNY]] in [[New York City]] (from 1994–2007) and then to [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]] (from 2007-2011). Presently, the ABC is headquartered at [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].

The '''Association of MBAs''' ('''AMBA''') is a global organisation founded in 1967 which focuses primarily on international business school accreditation and membership.

== Activities ==
Based in London, AMBA is one of the three main global accreditation bodies in business education (see '''[[Triple accreditation|Triple Accreditation]]''') and styles itself as the world's impartial authority on postgraduate management education. It differs from [[AACSB]] in the [[United States|US]] and [[EQUIS]] in [[Brussels]] as it accredits a school's portfolio of postgraduate management programmes but does not accredit undergraduate programmes. AMBA accredits approximately 2% of the world's business schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/business-schools/business-school-search/schools-a-to-z|title=Accredited Business Schools A-Z - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most international of the three organisations having accredited schools headquartered in 54 countries, compared with the 52 for AACSB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accredited-members|title=AACSB-Accredited Schools|website=www.aacsb.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38 for EQUIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools|title=EQUIS Accredited Schools|last=Pergoot|first=Nick|website=www.efmd.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business schools can become associated with AMBA in two ways: by applying for accreditation, or by applying for membership of the '''AMBA Development Network (ADN),''' which confers institutional membership similar to [[EFMD]] or AACSB membership. Schools that cannot meet all of the AMBA accreditation criteria usually join the ADN, which gives them time to prepare for accreditation with support from AMBA and mentoring from an AMBA-accredited school.

All MBA students and alumni of the [[List of institutions accredited by AMBA|257 accredited member schools]] join AMBA as individual members free of charge. AMBA also accredits generalist [[Master of Management|MBM]] programmes and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] programmes, and admits as members students and graduates thereof.

AMBA's long-serving president until 2017 was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], the founding benefactor of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] in Cambridge, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/president|title=President - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMBA's current Chief Executive is '''Andrew Main Wilson''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/chief-executive|title=Chief Executive - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joined the organisation from the [[Institute of Directors]] in 2013. '''Bodo Schlegelmilch''' was elected Chairman of the AMBA Board of Trustees in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/board-of-trustees|title=Board of Trustees - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Association of MBAs was founded in 1967 as an MBA alumni club by eight [[UK]] graduates from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford]] and [[Columbia Business School|Columbia]], and two graduates from the first intake of [[London Business School]]. The founders saw a lack of awareness in [[Europe]] of the value of the MBA degree, which at that time was primarily an American qualification. They decided to form a lobby and membership group to promote the benefits of postgraduate business education, under the name of Business Graduates Association (BGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's development helped shape the growth of management education in Europe and the UK and coincided with the setting up and growth of [[London Business School]] and [[Manchester Business School]] in Britain.

The Association's first Director General was Vice-Admiral [[David Clutterbuck]] who assumed this position in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Association of MBAs fabulous at forty, Ambition, January 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045432/http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 BGA began to accredit the growing number of [[MBA]] programmes, while preserving its functions as a membership organization. BGA was renamed Association of MBAs in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbaworld.com/aboutus/ourhis1&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2017, AMBA's president was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], who helped establish one of the two business schools in Cambridge, UK.

== Activities ==
=== Accreditation ===
[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]The Association of MBAs accredits MBA, MBM and DBA degree programmes. When a school  applies for accreditation for its MBA programmes, AMBA requires that the entire portfolio of MBA programmes be put up for consideration and will award accreditation only if all programmes meet its criteria (though the school pays the same fee regardless of the number of programmes being reviewed).

The Association's process of accrediting a school's MBA programmes portfolio includes reviewing compliance AMBA's criteria, most of them qualitative rather than quantitative. The criteria fall into seven dimensions: history and development of the institution; facilities and libraries; teaching faculty, teaching standards and research track record; programme administration, career and alumni services; student admission standards, diversity and cohort size; curriculum content, programme mode and duration; and learning outcomes.

Some of the key AMBA criteria for the accreditation of an MBA programme include:
* all admitted students should have at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience upon the start of the MBA course (''a criterion which the vast majority of the top US business schools cannot meet as US MBA programmes sometimes admit applicants with only a bachelor's degree and no work experience'');
* a new school applying for accreditation should have a track record of at least three years of graduating MBA students before it can be accredited;
* an MBA programme should have a cohort size of at least 20 students;
* at least 50% of the faculty of an MBA programme (including visiting faculty as part of the total) are expected to have PhD degrees; and
* a full-time MBA curriculum should contain no less than 500 contact (scheduled faculty-mediated) hours and a distance-learning MBA programme should have no less than 120 synchronous contact hours.

===  Events ===
AMBA holds three annual conferences for business school deans and directors:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbaworld.com/bschoolevents Events for business schools - Association of MBAs]. Mbaworld.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; a Global Conference, an Asia Pacific Conference, and a Latin America Conference. Participation is open to both accredited and non-accredited schools. AMBA also hosts an annual Gala Dinner in London, which is open only to accredited schools.

AMBA organises two annual global forums with the purpose of development and training for specific functions within AMBA-accredited business schools such as accreditation managers; programme managers; marketing, admissions, alumni and development staff.

AMBA also organises webinars, lectures and networking events on a regular basis catering to MBA alumni, current MBA students, prospective MBA students and business school admissions departments. These on-campus events are held at accredited business schools and often feature distinguished speakers and practitioners in fields such as leadership, entrepreneurship and innovation.

'''Asymmetric price transmission''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''APT''' and informally called "'''rockets and feathers'''" [http://www.slate.com/id/2196273/][https://web.archive.org/web/20080805205338/http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/001444.html][http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=978022]) refers to pricing phenomenon occurring when [[downstream price]]s react in a different manner to [[upstream price]] changes, depending on the characteristics of upstream prices or changes in those prices.

The simplest example is when prices of ready products increase promptly whenever prices of inputs increase, but take time to decrease after input price decreases.

== Introduction ==
=== Terminology ===
In business terms, ''price transmission'' means the process in which upstream prices affect downstream prices.  ''Upstream prices'' should be thought of in terms of main inputs prices (for processing / manufacturing, etc.) or prices quoted on higher market levels (e.g. wholesale markets). Accordingly, ''downstream prices'' should be thought of in terms of output prices (for processing / manufacturing, etc.) or prices quoted on lower [[market levels]] (e.g. [[retail markets]]).

=== Background Theory ===

Since (by definition) upstream and downstream prices are related:
*in absence of external shocks, some kind of [[economic equilibrium]] relationship between those two should exist;
*external shocks to the system (i.e. shocks to downstream or upstream prices) should trigger short- and long-run adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium, as:
**rational economic agents price their goods so as to maximize their constant utility function;
**in the long run prices of goods should reflect their scarcity.

== Example of Price Transmission ==
Price transmission is best illustrated by an example.  Assume that:
*[[commodities]] analysed are:
**[[crude oil]] - global upstream, and 
**[[petroleum]] - local downstream;
*market for petroleum in question is small compared to market for crude oil (in terms of quantities sold / bought), so that downstream prices cannot drive upstream prices;
**in the short run, only crude oil prices drive petroleum prices (i.e., prices of other inputs are assumed to be constant);
**no substitutes to petroleum are available in the short run.

Given the above, one might expect that:
*increases and decreases in crude oil prices trigger appropriate changes downstream;
*resulting changes are symmetric in terms of absolute size / timing.
	
Such behaviour, predicted by all canonical industry / market pricing models (perfect competition, monopoly) is called '''Symmetric Price Transmission'''. 

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Time asymmetry.png|thumb|right|Figure 1, Example of the time asymmetry|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 30 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
In contrast to [[Symmetric price transmission]], Asymmetric Price Transmission is said to exist when the adjustment of prices is not homogeneous with respect to characteristics external or internal to the system. As an example of Asymmetric Price Transmission consider a situation when:
*increases in crude oil prices lead to immediate increases in petroleum prices, but decreases in crude oil prices take time to be passed down to petroleum prices. This asymmetry is referred to as time asymmetry, or

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Combined asymmetry.png|thumb|left|Figure 2, Example of the combined asymmetry]] --&gt;
*combination of the time asymmetry and the size asymmetry (i.e., a situation when increases in crude oil prices lead to bigger changes (in absolute values) in petroleum prices than decreases).

One should remember that the size asymmetry cannot occur on its own. If that had been the case the [[upstream price]]s and [[downstream price]]s would drift apart. Since downstream prices and upstream prices are by definition related to each other, this cannot be the case. Accordingly, size asymmetry can occur only together with time asymmetry and only when the long-run relationship between prices is restored after the impulse shock to upstream prices.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Size asymmetry.png|thumb|right|Figure 3, Example of the size asymmetry]] --&gt;

==Consequences==
The issue of Asymmetric Price Transmission received a considerable attention in economic literature because of two reasons. 

Firstly, its presence is not in line with predictions of the canonical economic theory (e.g. [[perfect competition]] and [[monopoly]]), which expect that under some regularity assumptions (such as non-kinked, [[Convex function|convex]]/[[concave function|concave]] [[demand function]]) downstream responses to upstream changes should be symmetric in terms of absolute size and timing.
	
Secondly, because of the size of the some markets in which Asymmetric Price Transmission takes place (such as petroleum markets), global dependence on some products (again oil) and the share of income spent by average household on some products (again petroleum products), Asymmetric Price Transmission is important from the [[Quality of life|welfare]] point of view. One must remember that APT implies a welfare redistribution from agents downstream to agents upstream (presumably consumers to large energy companies); it has serious political and social consequences.

'''Bleisure travel''' ('''UK''' /ˈbleʒ.əʳ/ '''US''' /ˈbliː.ʒɚ/) is a [[portmanteau]] of “[[business]]” and “[[leisure]]”, and, it refers to “the activity of combining [[business travel]] with leisure time”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/author/cambridgewords|title=About words. New words – 1 January 2018|last=|first=|date=1 January 2018|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term bleisure was first published in 2009 by the Future Laboratory as part of their biannual Trend Briefing. The term was originally coined by writer and silent revolutionist, Jacob Strand, then a future forecaster working for The Future Laboratory. And co-written by journalist and futurologist Miriam Rayman.

In [[Corporate business travel|corporate business]] travel, extending a business trip for personal purposes is also known as “bizcation”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/maximizing-the-value-of-641761817|title=Maximizing the value of conferences to communities: 'Bleisure Travel' and 'Bizcations' emerge with social media boosts.|last=Zak|first=Karen|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been studied from 2011, from this year on, a report shows that bleisure travel has been maintaining a constant growth, accounting for 7% of all business trips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.gbta.org/l/5572/2017-06-02/55l1xn|title=Extending business travel into leisure time – Bleisure study|last=Global Business Travel Association in partnership with Hilton|first=|date=June 2017|website=GBTA Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bleisure traveller profiles ==
Bleisure travellers can be described as “individuals who combine leisure with professional business obligations when abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichy, McLeay|first=Jessica, Fraser|date=August 2017|title=Bleisure, motivation and typologies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318878088_Bleisure_Motivations_and_Typologies?enrichId=rgreq-0166c8432de1f7b171f9bd6a403e0082-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMxODg3ODA4ODtBUzo1MjMyMjc3MDI4NjE4MjRAMTUwMTc1ODYxMzY5Nw%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_3&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|volume=|pages=|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The elements characterising bleisure travellers are some and different, this make difficult to draw a defined profile of these individuals. Bleisure is a widespread practice among US travellers, especially for those working in [[Technology]], [[Health system|Healthcare]], [[Public administration|Public Administration]] sectors. A report shows that US traveller add bleisure to nearly half of the cases, precisely 52% for International trips and 42% for domestic ones. The main reasons for travelling would be [[conference]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[team building]], client meetings and [[presentation]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.advertising.expedia.com/influencing-bleisure-travelers|title=Profile of American bleisure traveller|last=Expedia Media Solutions and Luth Research|first=|date=6 December 2016|website=Expedia Media Solutions Blog|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travellers could be grouped according to various aspects, in particular [[gender]], [[Ageing|age]] and trip frequency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carlsonwagonlit.com/content/dam/cwt/pdf/insights/20160712-solutions-group-white-paper-bleisure.pdf|title=A quantitative look at the bleisure phenomenon|last=CWT Solutions Group|first=|date=July 2016|website=Carson Wagonlit Travel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research indicates that female business travellers would be more likely to take bleisure trips than male. In both groups 20% of travellers would take one or more bleisure trips in a year time, however women look to register higher rate: 8.5% against 6.8% of men.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this observation, CWT have looked at the average number of bleisure trips per bleisure travellers per year, this was roughly the same value for both genders (1.4). However, women take overall fewer business trips than men, on average. This difference in the total amount of business travel is responsible for the higher bleisure rate measured in the female population.&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger travellers (between 20 and 25) look significantly more likely to add weekends to their business trips, measuring a rate close to 15%. This result is two or three times higher than those for 45-50 age interval.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this finding, CWT calculated the average number of bleisure trips  in each segment. Across the age range 20 to 65, this varies from 1.3 to 1.5 bleisure trips/year. At the same time, the amount of total travel varies much more significantly (+2 trips/year), from the 20-25 to the 45-50 age interval. The larger denominator in the bleisure rate is thus responsible for the lower values observed in the 45-50 group. Interpretation: these results show that travellers appear to have fixed capacity for bleisure: when they do it, they take 1 or bleisure trips per year, almost irrespective of how much they travel. In other words, bleisure does not scale with the total amount of travel.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millennials]] travellers deserve a special attention because they appear to be the individuals shaping the future of business travel, nearly twice likely to travel for business than [[Baby boomers|Baby Boomers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could be attributed to their flexible attitude to life, which would lead to the blurring of the line between their private and professional life. Millennials seem to work often from home or during the evening hours, to dedicate leisure on-goings to traditional work hours. A consequence of this freedom could be their willingness to extend business trips including [[vacation]] activities. In comparison with other age group, Millennials look to be more likely to take bleisure trips, compared to older travellers. However, it is not clear whether this reflects unique preferences or transitory life events.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Do take more bleisure trips than other generations did in their 20s and 30s? Or will Millennials take much fewer bleisure trips in later years? It seems possible that Millennials are actually different. One observation in particular would reinforce this idea: When business travellers have children, they seem to be equally likely to extend their trip, compared to those who do not have them. This would suggest that, when Millennials will have families in greater numbers, they may still take bleisure trips&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent travellers taking 20 trips or more per year seem to be less than 5% likely to take a bleisure trip during the year, they would account for 8% of all bleisure trips. By contrast, one third of all bleisure trips would be taken by employees travelling once a month.

== Factors influencing the phenomenon ==
It seems evident that Millennials workers are increasingly demanding for bleisure from their work trip. Despite the state-of-the-art technology available nowadays, Millennials still prefer face-to-face meetings to get business done, therefore travel is still important for business companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.gbta.org/groups/reviews/item/20/11/2155|title=GBTA Business Traveler Sentiment Index™|last=GBTA Foundation|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travel looks as a good opportunity to save on travel expenses, mostly for those who do not take a lot of vacation: 66% of US business traveller spend more money on leisure activities because of the money they save on travel. 60% take bleisure trips because do not have a lot of regular vacations. To decide whether to turn a business travel into bleisure or not, employee takes into consideration travelling on exciting destinations, additional costs required to extend the trip, how close the trip is to the weekend, the number of night they must stay for business, how affordable the hotel is, whether they have friends or family in the area, whether they can bring friends or family along. The general trend would indicate the addition of one or two days as the most frequent option, only 23% of bleisure travellers would extend their trips for more than three days. In many cases leisure days equal (37%) or even exceed business days (42%). The length of business trip seems to be a crucial factor when considering extending the trip in 62% of cases. In particular, when business days are more than three, bleisure travellers are not only likely to extend the trip, but also to visit different cities in the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Advantages for employee and companies ==
For the [[Employment|employees]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/welcome-to-the-world-678428901|title="Welcome to the world of bleisure: the trend is growing of adding leisure time to the business trip."|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compromise between work [[duties]] and leisure time;
* [[Career development]].
* Possibility to bring family or friend with them; 
* Improvement of their [[well-being]];
For the companies:
* Improvement of the knowledge about the culture of the location they’re visiting that would simplify business negotiations;
* Possibility to have happier and therefore more productive employees;
* Discounted rate offered by the hotels;
* Opportunity to recruit new workers and attempting to retain current ones.

== Main activities and destinations ==
The more likely bleisure destinations are cities offering a combination of different elements, which could allow the travellers to add leisure time to their business trip, such as sightseeing locations, [[Sports venue|sport venues]] and cultural events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The difference between the origin and the destination city seems to affect bleisure rates: in the case of domestic trips, the amount of bleisure is expected to be low because the two cities should be easily accessible and share similar culture. On the other hand, long intercontinental trips would offer the chance to know realities that are different from ordinary. Researches seem to confirm this trend: bleisure trips would account for 5.2% of the domestic trips and 9.7% of the international ones. The highest bleisure rate (18.4%) appears in international trips when the origin and destination cities are located in different geographical regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The top bleisure cities in [[United States|US]] are: [[Honolulu]] (above 20%), [[Miami]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Las Vegas]] (12-15%) [[New York City|NYC]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] (9-12%). In [[Europe]] rates looks lower, this could be due to the shorter domestic and continental routes: [[Lisbon]], [[Barcelona]], [[Nice]], [[Istanbul]] (8-11%), [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Moscow]], [[Rome]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[Madrid]] (6-8%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Corporate policy ==
Given that bleisure travel is a rising phenomenon, there is still no official regulation, therefore extending business trips for bleisure would have to be decided by [[management]] on a case-by-case basis. Some preventive measures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/the-atlas/bleisure-travel-policy/|title=American Express Global Business Travel|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be followed in advance to avoid misunderstanding.
* Companies have to differentiate between business and non-business amenities and declare what is willing to pay for; 
* Employees have to define when the business travel ends and when the leisure one starts;
* Company and employees must arrange a corporate travel insurance.

A '''bowl sink''', the first [[neologism|coined term]] for the more commonly known ''vessel sink'', is a free-standing [[sink]] that sits directly on the counter-top or [[furniture]] on which it is mounted. Originally invented by Meredith Wolf,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} a former [[Rhode Island]] resident, the [[Product (business)|product]] is now a worldwide decorative piece of [[art]] which serves as a sink and provides [[decor]].

This type of sink is produced by numerous firms, and is found in many [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kohler.ca/planning/detail.jsp?aid=1138050337486.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{course assignment | course = Education Program:University College London/MSIN1003 Information World (Autumn 2014) | term = 2014 Q3}}{{Wiktionary|brick and mortar}}[[File:Marylebone High Street 12 Sept. 2015.JPG|thumb|Bricks and mortar retail shops on Marylebone High Street, London]]
'''Brick and mortar''' (also '''bricks and mortar''' or '''B&amp;M''') refers to a physical presence of an organization or business in a building or other structure.  The term ''brick-and-mortar business'' is often used to refer to a company that possesses or leases [[retail shop]]s,  factory production facilities, or warehouses for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investorwords.com/580/bricks_and_mortar.html |title=What is bricks and mortar? definition and meaning |publisher=Investorwords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, in the jargon of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] businesses in the 2000s, brick-and-mortar businesses are companies that have a physical presence (e.g., a [[Retailer|retail shop]] in a building) and offer face-to-face customer experiences.

This term is usually used to contrast with a transitory business or an [[Internet]]-only presence, such as fully [[online shop]]s, which have no physical presence for shoppers to visit, talk with staff in person, touch and handle products and buy from the firm in person. However, such online businesses normally have non-public physical facilities from which they either run business operations (e.g., the company headquarters and [[back office]] facilities), and/or warehouses for storing and distributing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/bricks-and-mortar.html |title=What is bricks and mortar? definition and meaning |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns such as foot traffic, [[shopfront]] visibility, and appealing interior design apply to brick-and-mortar businesses rather than online ones. An online-only business needs to have an attractive, well-designed [[website]], a reliable [[e-commerce]] system for payment, a good delivery or shipping service and effective online marketing tactics to drive [[web traffic]] to the site. Governments are also adopting [[e-government]] approaches, which is the use of online services for citizens to enable them to fill in government forms, pay tax bills and register for government programs online; these services aim to cut bricks and mortar costs (building leasing/purchase and staff costs) and improve services to citizens (by offering 24/7 access to information and services).

==Etymology==
The name is a [[metonym]] derived from the traditional building materials associated with physical buildings: [[brick]]s and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The term was originally used by 19th century British novelist [[Charles Dickens]] in the book ''[[Little Dorrit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''brick-and-mortar businesses'' is also a [[retronym]], in that most shops had a physical presence before the advent of the [[Internet]]. The term is also applicable in a pre-Internet era, when contrasting businesses with physical retail presence with those that operated strictly in an [[Mail order|order-by-mail]] capacity pre-[[Internet]].

==History==
[[ File:Afghan fruit stall 2-4-09.jpg|thumb|right|A fruit stand at a village market in Afghanistan.]]

The history of brick and mortar businesses cannot be dated precisely, but it existed in the earliest vendor stalls in the first towns, where merchants brought their agricultural produce, clay pots and handmade clothing to sell in a village [[Market (place)|market]]. Bricks and mortar businesses remain important in the 2010s, though many shops and services, ranging from [[consumer electronics]] shops to [[clothing shop]]s and even [[grocery shop]]s have begun offering online shopping. This physical presence, either of a retail shop, a [[customer service]] location with staff, where clients can go in person to ask questions about a product or service, or a service center or repair facility where customers can bring their products, has played a crucial role in providing goods and services to consumers throughout history.

All large retailers in the 19th and the early to mid-20th century started off with a smaller brick and mortar presence, which increased as the businesses grew. A prime example of this is [[McDonald’s]], a company that started with one small restaurant and now has nearly 36,000 restaurants in over 120 countries and plans to grow further; this shows the importance of having a physical presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chalabi|first1=Mona|title=McDonald's 34,492 restaurants: where are they?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jul/17/mcdonalds-restaurants-where-are-they|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many [[small business]]es, their business model is mostly limited to a bricks and mortar model, such as a [[diner]] restaurant or a [[dry cleaning]] service. Nevertheless, even service-based businesses can use websites and "apps" to reach new customers or improve their services. For example, a dry cleaning service could use a website to let customers know of the hours and location(s) of their bricks and mortar stores.

==Decline==
[[Netflix]], an online [[movie streaming]] website founded in 1997, is an example of how an online business has affected a B&amp;M businesses such as [[video rental store]]s. After Netflix and similar companies became popular, traditional DVD rental stores such as [[Blockbuster LLC]] went out of business. Customers preferred to be able to instantly watch movies and TV shows using "streaming", without having to go to a physical rental store to rent a DVD, and then return to the store to give the DVD back. "The rapid rise of [[Streaming media|online film streaming]] offered by the likes of [[Lovefilm]] and Netflix made Blockbuster's video and DVD [rental] business model practically obsolete.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Blockbuster to close remaining stores|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25345257|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an increase in online retailers in the 2000s, as people are using [[e-commerce]] (online sales) to fulfill basic needs ranging from grocery shopping to book purchases. Sales through mobile devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s have also risen in the 2000s: "While total online sales rose 18% year-on-year in December to £11.1 [B], according to the latest figures [January 2014] from e-tail industry body IMRG and advisory firm Capgemini, sales via mobile devices doubled to £3 [B].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Sarah|title=Shopping by smartphone and tablet in UK increases by 18%|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/15/shopping-smartphone-tablet-uk-increases-18-percent|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in households where both adults work outside the home, combined with the convenience of shopping for and buying products and services online, has decreased the number of customers going to retail outlets, as consumers can access the same information about products and services without paying for gas, parking and other costs, thus saving them time and money. "Today’s consumers lead busy lives and [Bricks and Mortar] shopping takes time. Often it is a [challenging] task. Consumers find researching and shopping on the Web far more convenient than brick-and-mortar visits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Brian|title=Retail In Crisis: These Are The Changes Brick-And-Mortar Stores Must Make|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2014/02/12/retail-in-crisis-these-are-the-changes-brick-and-mortar-stores-must-make/|website=www.forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is the introduction of online banking, which has affected bank branches on the High Street: "Barclays will shut at least 50 [Bricks and Mortar] branches this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walne|first1=Toby|title='We obviously do not make Barclays enough money': Dozens of branches to shut, despite bid to woo customers|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-2673197/Dozens-Barclays-branches-shut-despite-bid-woo-customers.html|website=This is Money|publisher=Financial Mail on Sunday|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brick and mortar businesses are not limited to having a physical presence only, they may also have an online presence such as [[Tesco]], who offer an online grocery service as well as a brick and mortar retail presence.

==Benefits==
The presence of brick and mortar establishments may bring many benefits to businesses;
* [[Customer service]]:  face-to-face customer service can be a big contributor into increasing sales of a business and improving customer satisfaction. When customers can take a product back to the store to ask staff questions or help them learn to use it, it can make customers feel more satisfied with their purchase. Research has shown that 86% of customers will pay more for a product if they have received great customer service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Improve customer service, Increase sales|url=http://www.sage.co.uk/business-advice/business-growth/infographic-improve-customer-service.html|website=Sage.co.uk|publisher=Sage|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Face-to-face interaction: Many consumers prefer to be able to touch products, and experience and test them out before they buy. This is often attributed to [[Baby Boomer]]s, older [[Generation X]] customers and the elderly being used to a more traditional in-person approach when it comes to shopping and preferring to have a demonstration of products or services, especially when buying new technology .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=High Street V Online|url=http://www.intersperience.com/article_more.asp?art_id=21|website=Intersperience.com|publisher=Intersperience|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies show, given equal prices, a 90% preference for the in-person shopping experience, including among teens, who combine social interaction with shopping. On the other hand, many of these consumers engage in [[showrooming]]: trying on clothes or otherwise examining merchandise in-store, and then buying online at cheaper prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Solid Ground: Brick-and-Mortar Is the Foundation of Omnichannel Retailing |publisher=A.T. Kearney|url=https://www.atkearney.com/consumer-products-retail/on-solid-ground|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
The brick and mortar approach also has various drawbacks.

===New businesses and fixed costs===

[[Fixed costs]] are a serious challenge for B&amp;M businesses. Fixed costs are payments that a business has to make for elements such as [[renting|rent]] of a store and monthly payments for services such as a [[security alarm]]. Fixed costs stay the same for a business even if it ramps up its operations or winds down its operations during a slow period. In contrast, [[variable costs]] change as a business ramps its operations up or down. Variable costs include [[wages]] (for employees paid by the hour) and [[electricity]] for operating machinery used by the business during its operating hours. If a business increases its hours of operation, its hourly wages and electricity bill will rise, but its rent and security alarm costs will stay the same (assuming that the business does not add additional locations). [[Start-up company|Start-up companies]] and other [[small business]]es typically find it hard to pay all of the fixed costs that are part of their venture. Research shows that 70% of new start up businesses fail within the first 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shane|first1=Scott|title=Illusions of Entrepreneurship: The Costly Myths that Entrepreneurs, Investors, and Policy Makers Live By|pages=99|url=http://smallbiztrends.com/2008/04/startup-failure-rates.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconvenient for customers with busy lifestyles===
People have busier lifestyles in the 2010s, with more families having both adults working, and therefore they find it harder to find the time to physically go and shop at stores and services. As well, in many cities [[traffic jam]]s and [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] on roads have made it more stressful and time-consuming to drive to physical locations to shop. Online shopping and online services, which consumers can access from an [[Internet]]-connected [[laptop]] or [[smartphone]] are more convenient for these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawson|first1=Alex|title=Shoppers 'hit the high streets with purpose' as footfall drops but spending rises|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/shoppers-hit-the-high-streets-with-purpose-as-footfall-drops-but-spending-rises-9733022.html|website=www.standard.co.uk|publisher=London Evening Standard|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With mobile devices, consumers can order take-out food, gifts and services even when they are "on the go", such as stuck sitting on a bus or waiting in an airport lounge for a plane.

===Expensive and luxury products===
B&amp;M increases the fixed cost for any business, therefore the products sold in physical shops tend to be more expensive compared to online shops. For stores selling expensive products or services in a B&amp;M format, customers expect beautiful window displays, fine decorating in the establishment and well-dressed salespeople who earn high [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] on their sales. Some high-end hair salons and luxury car stores even offer conveniences such as free [[espresso]] and bottled water, all of which add to the overhead of selling these products and services. Online shops, even those for luxury goods, do not have to pay for high-end retail stores and salespeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brownell|first1=Matt|title=5 Products You Shouldn’t Buy Online|url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-products-you-shouldn-t-buy-online|publisher=TheStreet Inc|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, high-end online stores typically incur higher costs for their online presence, because they need to have leading edge [[Web 2.0]] functions on their website, a professionally designed site, and in some cases, staff available to respond to phone calls, e-mails and online "chat" questions.

===Wider stock availability online===
Products may be out stock in relatively small brick and mortar retail stores and due to limited space in [[small business]] retail stores, these establishments may only be able to carry a few types of each product. Online shops are able to have a huge amount of stock in numerous large warehouses (e.g., [[Amazon.com]] has warehouses in numerous locations from which it ships its products) which it can quickly ship out. An online store may be able to order up products from a large number of geographically dispersed warehouses, even warehouses owned and operated by third parties (e.g., smaller companies), which are connected to the large company via the Internet.

===Queues===
Queues ([[Queue area|lineups]] and [[waiting room]]s) are part and parcel of B&amp;M retail businesses, due to physical constraints and the limitations on how many staff the business can afford to hire. A physical store may only have a few salespeople to serve customers, so many customers may have to wait in line during the busiest hours. To lessen the stress of waiting, some B&amp;M stores provide big-screen TVs with cable TV, free coffee and newspapers; while these niceties improve the customer experience, they add to the costs of operating a B&amp;M establishment. On the other hand, an online virtual store in which customers select their own purchases in a virtual "shopping cart" and pay for them using [[e-commerce]] approaches may be able to serve thousands of customers at the same time.

==E-government==
{{Main|E-government}}
Beginning in the 1990s and early 2000s, many governments in industrialised countries began to offer [[e-government]] services to citizens.  Online government services are offered by a range of government departments and agencies, ranging from departments of motor vehicles (online car registration), police (paying [[speeding ticket]]s online), city services (paying [[parking ticket]]s online or requesting that a [[pothole]] be filled) and social services (registering for [[social assistance]] or [[unemployment insurance]]) and tax departments (paying a tax bill or submitting a [[tax return]] online). Many governments use e-services to provide online information to citizens (e.g., "help" guides, [[Frequently Asked Question]] lists, manuals for government program applicants, etc.), thus saving on the need for [[call center]]s where citizens can call to ask questions or physical service locations where citizens can come in person to ask about government forms or services.

These online government services aim at two goals: reducing costs to governments and improving client service. By offering these services and information online, governments save money, because they do not have to offer as many bricks and mortar client service centers where citizens can come and fill in these forms and pay government bills. Governments offering e-services can also operate with less [[civil servant]]s and thus less salary and benefits costs, as the citizens using online services are generally doing all of the administrative tasks (e.g., downloading a form, filling in a form, looking up guidance in an online "help" manual, paying fees) themselves using their home computer. E-government services also improve service for citizens who have access to a computer, [[Internet]] and an online payment method (e.g., a [[credit card]] or [[PayPal]]), because these citizens are not limited by the 9 am-5 pm or 8 am-4 pm [[business hours]] of most physical government offices, and citizens do not have to incur the costs of transportation (e.g., bus tickets, gas, parking, etc.) associated with going to a bricks and mortar location. Nevertheless, government e-services do not help all citizens, due to the [[digital divide]]; citizens who are in [[poverty]], who are [[homelessness|homeless]] or who live in rural or remote regions may not have access to high speed [[Internet]]. These citizens, as well as those who are not comfortable with computers or those who do not understand how to use them, which in practice means elderly people, are not able to benefit from e-services.

Utilising the DW/BI system is the final step before business users can get access to the information. The first impression the business community gets is when introduced to the BI frontend drives. Because the acceptance from the users is important the deployment has to be thoughtfully planned to ensure that the DW/BI system can perform and is delivering the results it is designed to.
To ensure that the implementation can perform and deliver it has to be exposed to extensive end-to-end testing .&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Kimball|Kimball]] et al., ''The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit'', Second Edition. New York, Wiley, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-470-14977-5}}, 542&lt;/ref&gt; The process of testing is an ongoing activity along the development process, because defects that should be correct later in the lifecycle are difficult to find and are associated with exponentially increasing costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-management.com/issues/20070601/1086005-1.html?pg=1 Information Management: Strategies for Testing Data Warehouse Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; A way of securing that the testing is done through the development lifecycle is to follow a methodology.
Kimball prescribe that before adding the DW/BI system, it should have passed a mock test that will cover the following procedures;
 
* Testing procedures
* Data quality
* Operations process testing
* Performance testing
* Deployment testing
* User desktop readiness.

[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Howard Hughes]] was a major American aviation and film maverick during the 20th century.]]
A '''business magnate''' or '''industrialist''' is an [[entrepreneur]] of great influence, importance, or standing in a particular enterprise or field of business. The term characteristically refers to a wealthy entrepreneur or investor who controls, through personal business ownership or dominant shareholding position, a firm or industry whose goods or services are widely consumed. Such individuals may also be called ''[[Tsar|czar]]s'', ''[[Magnate|mogul]]s'', ''proprietors'', ''tycoons'', ''taipans'', ''[[baron]]s'', or ''[[Business oligarch|oligarch]]s''.

==Etymology==
The word ''[[magnate]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''magnates'' (plural of ''magnas''), meaning "a great man" or "great nobleman".
[[File:Jeff_Bezos_2016.jpg|thumb|upright|American retailer and founder of company [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Jeff Bezos]], who as of April 2018 is the [[The World's Billionaires|wealthiest person in the world.]]
]]
The word '''''tycoon''''' derives from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{Nihongo|[[taikun]]|大君}}, which means "great lord", used as a title for the ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American English Spelling: An Informal Description |last=Cummings |first= Donald Wayne |year=1988 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-3443-1 |page=277 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OVIqCV57pYC |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tycoon |title=tycoon |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 May 2012 |quote=Origin of TYCOON Japanese taikun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word entered the English language in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tycoon |title=tycoon |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 May 2012 |quote=First Known Use: 1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the return of [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] to the United States.  U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was humorously referred to as ''the Tycoon'' by his aides [[John Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Return of the Samurai |first=Adam |last=Goodheart |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/return-of-the-samurai/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term spread to the business community, where it has been used ever since.

The word ''mogul'' is an English corruption of ''mughal'', Persian or Arabic for "Mongol".  It alludes to emperors of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Medieval India]], who possessed great power and storied riches capable of producing wonders of opulence such as the [[Taj Mahal]].

==Usage==
Modern business magnates are entrepreneurs that amass on their own or wield substantial family fortunes in the process of building or running their own businesses. Some are widely known in connection with these entrepreneurial activities, others through high-visibility secondary pursuits such as [[philanthropy]], political fundraising and campaign financing, and sports team ownership or sponsorship.

The terms ''mogul'', ''tycoon'' and ''baron'' were often applied to late 19th and early 20th century [[North America]]n business magnates in [[natural resource|extractive industries]] such as [[mining]], [[logging]] and [[petroleum]], transportation fields such as [[shipping]] and [[rail transport|railroad]]s, manufacturing such as [[Automobile manufacturing|automaking]] and [[steel]]making, in [[banking]], as well as newspaper publishing. Their dominance was known as the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the [[Gilded Age]], or the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber Baron Era]].

&lt;!--Please discuss additions to the below list on the talk page so it does not become unwieldy--&gt;
Examples of well-known business magnates in the western world include historical figures such as oilman [[John D. Rockefeller]], automobile pioneer [[Henry Ford]], shipping and railroad veterans [[Aristotle Onassis]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Jay Gould]], and [[James J. Hill]], steel innovator [[Andrew Carnegie]], newspaper publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], retail merchant [[Sam Walton]], and banker [[J. P. Morgan]]. Contemporary industrial tycoons include e-commerce entrepreneur [[Jeff Bezos]], real estate developer [[Donald Trump]], investor [[Warren Buffett]], computer programmer [[Bill Gates]], technology innovator [[Steve Jobs]], steel investor [[Lakshmi Mittal]], telecommunications investor [[Carlos Slim]], airline owner Sir [[Richard Branson]], technology entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]], Formula 1 manager [[Bernie Ecclestone]], media entrepreneur [[Rupert Murdoch]], and poultry technologist [[Frank Perdue]].&lt;!--Please discuss additions to the above list on the talk page so it does not become unwieldy--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47367">[[Image:Business Process Reengineering  Cycle.svg|thumb|240px|Business process reengineering cycle]]
'''Business process re-engineering''' ('''BPR''') is a [[Strategic management|business management strategy]], originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the analysis and design of [[workflow]]s and [[business process]]es within an organization. BPR aimed to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s.&lt;ref name="GAO97"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/76302.pdf Business Process Re-engineering Assessment Guide], United States General Accounting Office, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. According to early BPR proponent Thomas Davenport (1990), a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. Re-engineering emphasized a [[Holism|holistic]] focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Business process reengineering is also known as business process redesign, [[business transformation]], or business process change management.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Reengineering guidence.jpg|thumb|240px|Reengineering guidance and relationship of mission and work processes to information technology.]]
Business process reengineering (BPR) is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's [[Mission statement|mission]] and reduce [[cost]]s. Organizations reengineer two key areas of their businesses. First, they use modern technology to enhance data dissemination and decision-making processes. Then, they alter functional organizations to form functional teams.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and [[requirements|customer needs]]. Basic questions are asked, such as "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?" An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly in terms of the wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, does it go on to decide how best to do it.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Within the [[Conceptual framework|framework]] of this basic assessment of mission and goals, re-engineering focuses on the organization's business processes—the steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create [[Product (business)|product]]s and [[Service (economics)|service]]s that meet the needs of particular [[customer]]s or [[Market (economics)|market]]s. As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether. Re-engineering identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Re-engineering recognizes that an organization's [[business process]]es are usually fragmented into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one is responsible for the overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

== History ==
Business process reengineering (BPR) began as a private sector technique to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated [[information system]]s and [[Computer network|networks]]. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

=== Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990 ===
In 1990, [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]], a former professor of computer science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), published the article "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate" in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', in which he claimed that the major challenge for managers is to obliterate forms of work that do not add value, rather than using technology for automating it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammer, [http://hbr.org/1990/07/reengineering-work-dont-automate-obliterate "Reengineering Work: Don’t Automate, Obliterate"], ''Hardvard Business Review'', July, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; This statement implicitly accused managers of having focused on the wrong issues, namely that technology in general, and more specifically information technology, has been used primarily for automating existing processes rather than using it as an enabler for making non-value adding work obsolete.

Hammer's claim was simple: Most of the work being done does not add any value for customers, and this work should be removed, not accelerated through automation. Instead, companies should reconsider their inability to satisfy customer needs, and their insufficient cost structure{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Even well-established management thinkers, such as [[Peter Drucker]]  and [[Tom Peters]], were accepting and advocating BPR as a new tool for (re-)achieving success in a dynamic world.&lt;ref name="Forbes93"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/08/23/78237/index.htm Forbes: Reengineering, The Hot New Managing Tool], August 23, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, a fast-growing number of publications, books as well as journal articles, were dedicated to BPR, and many consulting firms embarked on this trend and developed BPR methods. However, the critics were fast to claim that BPR was a way to dehumanize the work place, increase managerial control, and to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]], i.e. major reductions of the work force,&lt;ref&gt;(Greenbaum 1995, Industry Week 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and a rebirth of [[Taylorism]] under a different label.

Despite this critique, reengineering was adopted at an accelerating pace and by 1993, as many as 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.&lt;ref name="AAAI"&gt;[http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031 Hamscher, Walter: "AI in Business-Process Reengineering"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311194739/http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031|date=11 March 2014}}, AI Magazine Volume 15 Number 4, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, but also by the study ''Made in America'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Dertouzos, Robert M. Solow and Richard K. Lester (1989) ''Made In America: Regaining the Productive Edge''. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, [[time-to-market]] and [[productivity]].

=== Development after 1995 ===
With the publication of critiques in 1995 and 1996 by some{{Who|date=August 2016}} of the early BPR proponents{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, coupled with abuses and misuses of the concept by others, the reengineering fervor in the U.S. began to wane. Since then, considering business processes as a starting point for business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed.

More recently, the concept of [[Business Process Management]] (BPM) has gained major attention in the corporate world and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for process efficiency supported by information technology. Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change.

== Topics ==
The most notable definitions of reengineering are:
* "... the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer and Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, human, and organizational dimensions."&lt;ref name="dav93"&gt;[[Thomas H. Davenport]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR is different from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, by virtue of its aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson ''et al.'' (1993):  "Business Process Reengineering, although a close relative, seeks radical rather than merely continuous improvement. It escalates the efforts of JIT and TQM to make process orientation a strategic tool and a core competence of the organization. BPR concentrates on core business processes, and uses the specific techniques within the JIT and TQM ”toolboxes” as enablers, while broadening the process vision."&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of [[information technology]] (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

BPR derives its existence from different disciplines, and four major areas can be identified as being subjected to change in BPR – organization, technology, strategy, and people – where a process view is used as common framework for considering these dimensions.

Business strategy is the primary driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role. The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, and the distribution of work between them{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of [[communication technology]] in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as enabler of new forms of organizing and collaborating, rather than supporting existing business functions. The people / [[human resources]] dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, motivation and reward systems. The concept of business processes – interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer – is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: Process ownership, customer focus, value adding, and cross-functionality.

===The role of information technology===
Information technology (IT) has historically played an important role in the reengineering concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aca0b8dc-dfc0-11df-bed9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VySiR5f7 Business efficiency: IT can help paint a bigger picture, Financial Times, featuring Ian Manocha, Lynne Munns and Andy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

BPR literature&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hammer &amp; Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; identified several so called ''disruptive technologies'' that were supposed to challenge traditional wisdom about how work should be performed.
* Shared databases, making information available at many places  
* Expert systems, allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks
* Telecommunication networks, allowing organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time
* Decision-support tools, allowing decision-making to be a part of everybody's job
* [[Wireless data communication]] and [[portable computer]]s, allowing field personnel to work office independent
* Interactive videodisk, to get in immediate contact with potential buyers
* Automatic identification and tracking, allowing things to tell where they are, instead of requiring to be found
* High performance computing, allowing on-the-fly planning and revisioning

In the mid-1990s, especially workflow management systems were considered a significant contributor to improved process efficiency. Also, ERP ([[enterprise resource planning]]) vendors, such as [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[JD Edwards]], Oracle, [[PeopleSoft]], positioned their solutions as vehicles for business process redesign and improvement.

===Research and methodology ===
[[Image:Bpr1.png|thumb|240px|Model based on PRLC approach]]
Although the labels and steps differ slightly, the early methodologies that were rooted in IT-centric BPR solutions share many of the same basic principles and elements. The following outline is one such model, based on the PRLC (Process Reengineering Life Cycle) approach developed by Guha.&lt;ref&gt;Guha et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified schematic outline of using a business process approach, exemplified for pharmaceutical R&amp;D
# Structural organization with functional units
# Introduction of New Product Development as cross-functional process
# Re-structuring and streamlining activities, removal of non-value adding tasks

Benefiting from lessons learned from the early adopters, some BPR practitioners advocated a change in emphasis to a customer-centric, as opposed to an IT-centric, methodology.  One such methodology, that also incorporated a Risk and Impact Assessment to account for the effect that BPR can have on jobs and operations, was described by Lon Roberts (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Lon Roberts (1994) ''Process reengineering: the key to achieving breakthrough success''.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also stressed the use of change management tools to proactively address resistance to change—a factor linked to the demise of many reengineering initiatives that looked good on the drawing board.

Some items to use on a process analysis checklist are: Reduce handoffs, Centralize data, Reduce delays, Free resources faster, Combine similar activities. Also within the management consulting industry, a significant number of methodological approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;A set of short papers, outlining and comparing some of them can be found here, followed by some guidelines for companies considering to contract a consultancy for a BPR initiative:

=== Framework ===
An easy to follow seven step INSPIRE framework is developed by Bhudeb Chakravarti which can be followed by any Process Analyst to perform BPR. The seven steps of the framework are '''Initiate''' a new process reengineering project and prepare a business case for the same; '''Negotiate''' with senior management to get approval to start the process reengineering project; '''Select''' the key processes that need to be reengineered; '''Plan''' the process reengineering activities; '''Investigate''' the processes to analyze the problem areas; '''Redesign''' the selected processes to improve the performance and '''Ensure''' the successful implementation of redesigned processes through proper monitoring and evaluation.

== Factors for success and failure ==
{{tone|date=February 2014}}
Factors that are important to BPR success include:

# BPR team composition.
# Business needs analysis.
# Adequate IT infrastructure.
# Effective [[change management]]. 
# Ongoing continuous improvement

The aspects of a BPM effort that are modified include organizational structures, management systems, employee responsibilities and performance measurements, incentive systems, skills development, and the use of IT. BPR can potentially affect every aspect of how business is conducted today.  Wholesale changes can cause results ranging from enviable success to complete failure.

If successful, a BPM initiative can result in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of reengineering projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Productivity Organization: Business Process re-engineering. http://www.apo-tokyo.org/productivity/pmtt_016.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons for sub-optimal business processes which include:

# One department may be optimized at the expense of another
# Lack of time to focus on improving business process
# Lack of recognition of the extent of the problem
# Lack of training
# People involved use the best tool they have at their disposal which is usually [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] to fix problems
# Inadequate infrastructure
# Overly bureaucratic processes
# Lack of motivation

Many unsuccessful BPR attempts may have been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed.  Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them.  As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"&gt;(Covert, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process.  Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.&lt;ref&gt;(Berman, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization-wide commitment ===
Major changes to business processes have a direct effect on processes, technology, job roles, and workplace culture.  Significant changes to even one of those areas require resources, money, and leadership.  Changing them simultaneously is an extraordinary task.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt; Like any large and complex undertaking, implementing reengineering requires the talents and energies of a broad spectrum of experts.  Since BPR can involve multiple areas within the organization, it is important to get support from all affected departments. Through the involvement of selected department members, the organization can gain valuable input before a process is implemented; a step which promotes both the cooperation and the vital acceptance of the reengineered process by all segments of the organization.

Getting enterprise wide commitment involves the following: top management sponsorship, bottom-up buy-in from process users, dedicated BPR team, and budget allocation for the total solution with measures to demonstrate value. Before any BPR project can be implemented successfully, there must be a commitment to the project by the management of the organization, and strong leadership must be provided.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"&gt;(Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Reengineering efforts can by no means be exercised without a company-wide commitment to the goals.  However, top management commitment is imperative for success.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"&gt;(Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  Top management must recognize the need for change, develop a complete understanding of what BPR is, and plan how to achieve it.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"&gt;(Motwani, et al., 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership has to be effective, strong, visible, and creative in thinking and understanding in order to provide a clear [[company vision|vision]].&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"&gt;(Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Convincing every affected group within the organization of the need for BPR is a key step in successfully implementing a process.  By informing all affected groups at every stage, and emphasizing the positive end results of the reengineering process, it is possible to minimize resistance to change and increase the odds for success. The ultimate success of BPR depends on the strong, consistent, and continuous involvement of all departmental levels within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;(King, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team composition ===
Once organization-wide commitment has been secured from all departments involved in the reengineering effort and at different levels, the critical step of selecting a BPR team must be taken. This team will form the nucleus of the BPR effort, make key decisions and recommendations, and help communicate the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization. The determinants of an effective BPR team may be summarized as follows: 
* competency of the members of the team, their motivation,&lt;ref&gt;(Rastogi, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* their credibility within the organization and their creativity,&lt;ref&gt;(Barrett, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* team empowerment, training of members in process mapping and brainstorming techniques,&lt;ref name="Carr, 1993"&gt;(Carr, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* effective team leadership,&lt;ref&gt;(Berrington &amp; Oblich, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* proper organization of the team,&lt;ref&gt;(Guha, et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* complementary skills among team members, adequate size, interchangeable accountability, clarity of work approach, and 
* specificity of goals.&lt;ref&gt;(Katzenbach &amp; Smith, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective BPR teams include active representatives from the following work groups: top management, business area responsible for the process being addressed, technology groups, finance, and members of all ultimate process users’ groups. Team members who are selected from each work group within the organization will affect the outcome of the reengineered process according to their desired requirements.  The BPR team should be mixed in depth and knowledge.  For example, it may include members with the following characteristics:

* Members who do not know the process at all.
* Members who know the process inside-out.
* Customers, if possible.
* Members representing affected departments.
* One or two members of the best, brightest, passionate, and committed technology experts.
* Members from outside of the organization&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

Moreover, Covert (1997) recommends that in order to have an effective BPR team, it must be kept under ten players.  If the organization fails to keep the team at a manageable size, the entire process will be much more difficult to execute efficiently and effectively.  The efforts of the team must be focused on identifying breakthrough opportunities and designing new work steps or processes that will create quantum gains and competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"/&gt;

=== Business needs analysis ===
Another important factor in the success of any BPR effort is performing a thorough business needs analysis.  Too often, BPR teams jump directly into the technology without first assessing the current processes of the organization and determining what exactly needs reengineering. In this analysis phase, a series of sessions should be held with process owners and stakeholders, regarding the need and strategy for BPR.  These sessions build a consensus as to the vision of the ideal business process. They help identify essential goals for BPR within each department and then collectively define objectives for how the project will affect each work group or department on individual basis and the business organization as a whole. The idea of these sessions is to conceptualize the ideal business process for the organization and build a business process model.  Those items that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be eliminated or modified later on in the diagnosing stage of the BPR project. It is important to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas in order to make all participants feel that they are a part of this important and crucial process.  Results of these meetings will help formulate the basic plan for the project.

This plan includes the following: 
* identifying specific problem areas, 
* solidifying particular goals, and 
* defining business objectives.  
The business needs analysis contributes tremendously to the re-engineering effort by helping the BPR team to prioritize and determine where it should focus its improvements efforts.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

The business needs analysis also helps in relating the BPR project goals back to key business objectives and the overall strategic direction for the organization.  This linkage should show the thread from the top to the bottom of the organization, so each person can easily connect the overall business direction with the re-engineering effort. This alignment must be demonstrated from the perspective of financial performance, customer service, associate value, and the vision for the organization.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Developing a business vision and process objectives relies, on the one hand, on a clear understanding of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and market structure, and on the other, on awareness and knowledge about innovative activities undertaken by competitors and other organizations.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"&gt;(Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
BPR projects that are not in alignment with the organization’s strategic direction can be counterproductive.  There is always a possibility that an organization may make significant investments in an area that is not a core competency for the company and later outsource this capability.  Such reengineering initiatives are wasteful and steal resources from other strategic projects. Moreover, without strategic alignment, the organization’s key stakeholders and sponsors may find themselves unable to provide the level of support the organization needs in terms of resources, especially if there are other more critical projects to the future of the business, and are more aligned with the strategic direction.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;

=== Adequate IT infrastructure ===
Researchers consider adequate [[IT infrastructure]] reassessment and composition as a vital factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  Hammer (1990) prescribes the use of IT to challenge the assumptions inherent in the work process that have existed since long before the advent of modern computer and communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Factors related to IT infrastructure have been increasingly considered by many researchers and practitioners as a vital component of successful BPR efforts.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"&gt;(Ross, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Effective alignment of IT infrastructure and BPR strategy, 
* building an effective IT infrastructure,
* adequate IT infrastructure investment decision, 
* adequate measurement of IT infrastructure effectiveness,
* proper information systems (IS) integration, 
* effective reengineering of legacy IS, 
* increasing IT function competency, and 
* effective use of software tools are the most important factors that contribute to the success of BPR projects.

These are vital factors that contribute to building an effective IT infrastructure for business processes.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  BPR must be accompanied by strategic planning which addresses leveraging IT as a competitive tool.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"&gt;(Weicher, et al., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; An IT infrastructure is made up of physical assets, intellectual assets, shared services,&lt;ref&gt;(Broadbent &amp; Weill, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and their linkages.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"&gt;(Kayworth, et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which the IT infrastructure components are composed and their linkages determines the extent to which information resources can be delivered.  An effective IT infrastructure composition process follows a top-down approach, beginning with business strategy and IS strategy and passing through designs of data, systems, and computer architecture.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Linkages between the IT infrastructure components, as well as descriptions of their contexts of interaction, are important for ensuring integrity and consistency among the IT infrastructure components.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt;  Furthermore, IT standards have a major role in reconciling various infrastructure components to provide shared IT services that are of a certain degree of effectiveness to support business process applications, as well as to guide the process of acquiring, managing, and utilizing IT assets.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"/&gt; The IT infrastructure shared services and the human IT infrastructure components, in terms of their responsibilities and their needed expertise, are both vital to the process of the IT infrastructure composition.  IT strategic alignment is approached through the process of integration between business and IT strategies, as well as between IT and organizational infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;

Most analysts view BPR and IT as irrevocably linked.  Walmart, for example, would not have been able to reengineer the processes used to procure and distribute mass-market retail goods without IT.  Ford was able to decrease its headcount in the procurement department by 75 percent by using IT in conjunction with BPR, in another well-known example.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"/&gt; The IT infrastructure and BPR are interdependent in the sense that deciding the information requirements for the new business processes determines the IT infrastructure constituents, and a recognition of IT capabilities provides alternatives for BPR.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt; Building a responsive IT infrastructure is highly dependent on an appropriate determination of business process information needs.  This, in turn, is determined by the types of activities embedded in a business process, and their sequencing and reliance on other organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;(Sabherwal &amp; King, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effective change management ===
Al-Mashari and Zairi (2000) suggest that BPR involves changes in people behavior and culture, processes, and technology.  As a result, there are many factors that prevent the effective implementation of BPR and hence restrict innovation and continuous improvement. [[Change management]], which involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and to deal effectively with resistance, is considered by many researchers to be a crucial component of any BPR effort.One of the most overlooked obstacles to successful BPR project implementation is resistance from those whom implementers believe will benefit the most.  Most projects underestimate the cultural effect of major process and structural change and as a result, do not achieve the full potential of their change effort.  Many people fail to understand that change is not an event, but rather a management technique.

Change management is the discipline of managing change as a process, with due consideration that employees are people, not programmable machines.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.  An important step towards any successful reengineering effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  It is a well-known fact that organizations do not change unless people change; the better change is managed, the less painful the transition is.

[[Organizational culture]] is a determining factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref&gt;(Zairi &amp; Sinclair, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizational culture influences the organization’s ability to adapt to change.  Culture in an organization is a self-reinforcing set of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.  Culture is one of the most resistant elements of organizational behavior and is extremely difficult to change. BPR must consider current culture in order to change these beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors effectively.  Messages conveyed from management in an organization continually enforce current culture.  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.

The first step towards any successful transformation effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  Management rewards system, stories of company origin and early successes of founders, physical symbols, and company icons constantly enforce the message of the current culture. Implementing BPR successfully is dependent on how thoroughly management conveys the new cultural messages to the organization.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;  These messages provide people in the organization with a guideline to predict the outcome of acceptable behavior patterns.  People should be the focus for any successful business change.
  
BPR is not a recipe for successful business transformation if it focuses on only computer technology and process redesign.  In fact, many BPR projects have failed because they did not recognize the importance of the human element in implementing BPR.  Understanding the people in organizations, the current company culture, motivation, leadership, and past performance is essential to recognize, understand, and integrate into the vision and implementation of BPR.  If the human element is given equal or greater emphasis in BPR, the odds of successful business transformation increase substantially.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;

=== Ongoing continuous improvement ===
Many organizational change theorists hold a common view of organizations adjusting gradually and incrementally and responding locally to individual crises as they arise&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt; Common elements are:  
* BPR is a successive and ongoing process and should be regarded as an improvement strategy that enables an organization to make the move from traditional functional orientation to one that aligns with strategic business processes.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"/&gt;  
* Continuous improvement is defined as the propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements in its processes, products, and services.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  The incremental change is governed by the knowledge gained from each previous change cycle.  
* It is essential that the automation infrastructure of the BPR activity provides for performance measurements in order to support continuous improvements.  It will need to efficiently capture appropriate data and allow access to appropriate individuals.  
* To ensure that the process generates the desired benefits, it must be tested before it is deployed to the end users.  If it does not perform satisfactorily, more time should be taken to modify the process until it does.  
* A fundamental concept for quality practitioners is the use of feedback loops at every step of the process and an environment that encourages constant evaluation of results and individual efforts to improve.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"&gt;(Gore, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* At the end user’s level, there must be a proactive feedback mechanism that provides for and facilitates resolutions of problems and issues.  This will also contribute to a continuous risk assessment and evaluation which are needed throughout the implementation process to deal with any risks at their initial state and to ensure the success of the reengineering efforts.  
* Anticipating and planning for risk handling is important for dealing effectively with any risk when it first occurs and as early as possible in the BPR process.&lt;ref&gt;(Clemons, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is interesting that many of the successful applications of reengineering described by its proponents are in organizations practicing continuous improvement programs.  
* Hammer and Champy (1993) use the IBM Credit Corporation as well as Ford and Kodak, as examples of companies that carried out BPR successfully due to the fact that they had long-running continuous improvement programs.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"/&gt;

In conclusion, successful BPR can potentially create substantial improvements in the way organizations do business and can actually produce fundamental improvements for business operations.  However, in order to achieve that, there are some key success factors that must be taken into consideration when performing BPR.

BPR success factors are a collection of lessons learned from reengineering projects and from these lessons common themes have emerged.  In addition, the ultimate success of BPR depends on the people who do it and on how well they can be committed and motivated to be creative and to apply their detailed knowledge to the reengineering initiative. Organizations planning to undertake BPR must take into consideration the success factors of BPR in order to ensure that their reengineering related change efforts are comprehensive, well-implemented, and have minimum chance of failure. This has been very beneficial in all terms

== Critique ==
Many companies used reengineering as a pretext to [[layoff|downsizing]], though this was not the intent of reengineering's proponents; consequently, reengineering earned a reputation for being synonymous with downsizing and layoffs.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2008/09/06000936/Michael-Hammer-who-made-reeng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many circumstances, reengineering has not always lived up to its expectations. Some prominent reasons include:
* Reengineering assumes that the factor that limits an organization's performance is the ineffectiveness of its processes (which may or may not be true) and offers no means of validating that assumption.
* Reengineering assumes the need to start the process of performance improvement with a "clean slate," i.e. totally disregard the ''[[status quo]].''
* According to [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (and his [[Theory of Constraints]]) reengineering does not provide an effective way to focus improvement efforts on the organization's constraint{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

Others have claimed that reengineering was a recycled [[buzzword]] for commonly-held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for Reengineering peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that Reengineering was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the [[assembly line]] in 1908, he was in fact reengineering, radically changing the way of thinking in an organization).

The most frequent critique against BPR concerns the strict focus on efficiency and technology and the disregard of people in the organization that is subjected to a reengineering initiative. Very often, the label BPR was used for major workforce reductions. Thomas Davenport, an early BPR proponent, stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I wrote about "business process redesign" in 1990, I explicitly said that using it for cost reduction alone was not a sensible goal. And consultants Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two names most closely associated with reengineering, have insisted all along that layoffs shouldn't be the point. But the fact is, once out of the bottle, the reengineering genie quickly turned ugly."&lt;ref&gt;(Davenport, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hammer similarly admitted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I wasn't smart enough about that. I was reflecting my engineering background and was insufficient appreciative of the human dimension. I've learned that's critical."&lt;ref&gt;(White, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

A '''chief science officer''' ('''C.S.O.''') is a position at the head of scientific research operations at organizations or companies performing significant scientific research projects.

==Description==
A C.S.O. typically is responsible for envisioning and developing research capabilities (human, methodological, and technological), for developing evidence of the validity and utility of research products, and for communicating with the scientific and customer communities concerning capabilities and scientific product offerings. 

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of [[chief technology officer]] (C.T.O.). Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, C.S.Os exists in heavily research-oriented companies, while C.T.Os exists in [[product development]] focused companies. The typical category of [[research and development]] that exists in many science and technology companies can be led by either post, depending upon which area is the organization's primary focus. 

A C.S.O. almost always has a pure science background and an advanced degree, whereas a C.T.O. often has a background in engineering or business development.

Some academic research organizations, such as the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Chase Cancer Center News {{!}} Fox Chase Cancer Center - Philadelphia, PA|url=http://www.fccc.edu/news/2008/2008-07-28-Jeff-Boyd.html|website=www.fccc.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research - Dana-Farber Cancer Institute {{!}} Boston, MA|url=http://www.dana-farber.org/res/scientificreport/message-from-chief-scientific-officer.html|website=www.dana-farber.org|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] have adopted a similar title of C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael L. Norman Appointed Chief Scientific Officer of SDSC|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/supercomputer/06-08MichealNorman.asp|website=ucsdnews.ucsd.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, their role is to evaluate and set scientific priorities and coordinate the administrative structure that supports scientists. A C.S.O. commonly has a scientific or academic background, yet they may or may not be practicing scientists or academics.

==England==

In the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], the C.S.O. is the head of profession for the 53,000 [[Healthcare science|healthcare scientists]] working in the organization and its associated bodies. The C.S.O. is one of six NHS professional officers (including the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|chief medical officer]] and the [[Chief Nursing Officer|chief nursing officer]]) who are employed within [[NHS England]]. These roles lead their own professional groups as well as providing expert knowledge about their specific disciplines to the NHS and wider health and care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |title=Appointments |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411073747/http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C.S.O. provides professional leadership and expert clinical advice across the health system, as well as working alongside senior clinical leaders within NHS England and the broader commissioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/02/11/nhs-commissioning-board-appoints-its-first-chief-scientific-officer/ |title=NHS Commissioning Board appoints its first Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |date = 11 February 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The C.S.O. is also responsibility for delivering the government's strategy for a modernised healthcare science workforce, [[Modernising Scientific Careers]].

An example is the income summary account containing [[revenue]] and [[expense]] amounts to be transferred to [[retained earnings]] at the close of a fiscal period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/clearing-account.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other example of clearing account is excise clearing account.

'''Commercial law''', also known as '''trade law''', is the body of [[law]] that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of [[Legal person|persons]] and businesses engaged in [[commerce]], [[merchandising]], [[trade]], and sales.&lt;ref name=cornellcommerciallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]].

Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; [[Maritime transport|merchant shipping]]; [[guarantee]]; marine, fire, life, and accident [[insurance]]; bills of exchange, [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]], [[Contract|contracts]] and partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Commercial Law|volume=6|page=771|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these categories fall within [[Financial law]], an aspected of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate [[corporation|corporate]] [[contract]]s, [[Recruitment|hiring practices]], and the [[manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[sales]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]]. Many countries have adopted [[civil code]]s that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.

In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the [[United States Congress]], under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adoption]] of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the U.S. territories.

Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly ''vis-a-vis'' employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

'''Communication quotient''', '''communication intelligence''', or '''CQ''' is a [[Business philosophy|theory]] that [[communication]] is a [[behaviour]] based skill that can be measured and trained.  CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another.  The first scholarly article referring to CQ was by Robert Service in CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals.  The article was published in 2005 in the Journal of [[Information Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 at [[TED conference|TED]] Women, Clare Munn spoke about the importance of our Communication Quotient in an increasingly digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|url=http://www.tedwomen.aol.com/2010/10/03/clare-munn/|work=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|publisher=TEDWomen|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of CQ as a theory and a concept can be traced back to the challenging of [[IQ]] as fully explaining cognitive ability in 1983, by [[Howard Gardner]] with his [[Theory of multiple intelligences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|url=https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465025102|work=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|publisher=New York|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gardner's view, traditional types of [[intelligence]], such as IQ, fail to fully explain [[cognitive ability]].  The development of CQ is part of the trend to analyse and fully understand [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], a trend led by [[Daniel Goleman]]’s [[emotional intelligence]] and social intelligence.

==Definition==
''[[The Times of India]]'' in 2005 , in an article entitled A Shift from IQ, referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were testing for amongst Indian graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shift from IQ|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/A-Shift-from-IQ/articleshow/1010684.cms|work=A Shift from IQ|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=Improving Your Communication Quotient|url=http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/CQ.htm.|work=Improving Your Communication Quotient|publisher=Expressions of Excellence|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Clare Munn and [[Maria Bello]] defined CQ as "Expressive &amp; Receptive Intelligence" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Social Media's Value Proposition Might Just be CQ|url=http://claremunn.com/2009/04/cq-social-medias-value-proposition/|work=CQ: Expressive and Receptive Intelligence|publisher=Clare Munn|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in ''The CQ Manifesto'' defined CQ as  "saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Institute - What is CQ?|url=http://www.cqinstitute.com/CQ/what_is_cq.htm|work=The CQ Manifesto - Communication Intelligence: the 5 professional personas that will transform your work life and super-charge your organisation|publisher=CQ Institute|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robert Service’s 2005 article he presented the communication quotient as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals.  Service argues that the improvement of communication ability will allow individuals the opportunity to move up in the organisational ranks.  The article presents two models to explain communication, the first is the model of two-way communications and the second is the CQ measurement and improvement matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was founded in the 1970s and currently holds 41 offices throughout Atlantic Canada. The 41 offices are autonomous corporations but each work with their respective Provincial Association office. The Provincial Association offices are located in; Alberton, PEI; Elmsdale, NS; Mount Pearl, NL; and Bathurst, NB. These 4 offices work with the Atlantic Association of CBDCs to constantly improve the services offered by the CBDC network. The CBDCs are a member of the [[Community Futures|Community Futures Network of Canada]].

== Operating Structure ==

'''Corporate sourcing''' refers to a system where divisions of companies coordinate the [[procurement]] and distribution of materials, parts, equipment, and supplies for the organization.  This is a [[supply chain]], [[purchasing]]/[[procurement]], and [[inventory]] function. This enables [[bulk discounting]], [[auditing]], and [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley compliance]].

Duties of a corporate sourcing agent include:
#Coordinating all activities related to [[procurement]] of a [[commodity]] beginning with intent to purchase through delivery
#Analyzing the requirements of the commodity, including preliminary specifications, preferred supplier, and date commodity is needed
#Soliciting and evaluating proposals for the requested commodity. Investigating and/or interviewing potential suppliers to determine if they meet the specified requirements.

Some of corporate sourcing agents:
[[Richman Chemical]], [[Onetouch]], [[Worldwide Brands]], [[SAOS]]

A '''creative professional''' who is also known as a '''creative specialist''' is a person who is employed for the extraction of skills in creative endeavors. Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, scientific research and development, product development, engineering, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be doubled.

==History==
Although creative professionals have been a part of the workforce for more than 500 years, several events during the past decade have altered industry and public perception of these workers.

The change in status began in the late 1990s when demand for creative workers was high due to the internet boom. Creative workers found that their talents in [[graphic design|graphic]] and interactive design were valuable, and so, the workers began to develop independent cultures in select cities throughout the world, notably [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]] and [[Boston]]. Some smaller cities, such as [[Austin]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] also became centers where creative people found abundant opportunity. This trend has been documented in author [[Richard Florida]]'s book, The Creative Class.

As the creative workforce has evolved in the post-dot.com era, creative workers have continued to flourish. [[Daniel H. Pink]]'s book ''A Whole New Mind'' describes the transition in American business from [[information age]] to conceptual age. Pink describes information-era jobs as expendable and exportable, and offers that the [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] may yield more value for newer American workers than the [[MBA]] might generate in today's economy.

The Creative Professional, by Howard Blumenthal, describes the phenomenon from yet another perspective: that of the individual worker now emerging as a serious business professional with specific skills on par with lawyers, accountants, doctors, and other workers who are perceived to be within a special class. The book describes the unique business and career issues for the individual creative worker.

==Expansion of scope and study==
To date, most of the information about this growing phenomenon exists in book form. Many of the ideas and mechanisms are related to changes in copyright law, as described by [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Creative Commons]].

University education for creative professionals is often presented under older definitions of music, art, and related disciplines, but the processes related to creative thought, particularly as they apply to work, are found in books about cognitive psychology. Author and cognitive thinking researcher [[Howard Gardner]] has defined a variety of intelligences related to creative workers. Psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] has described the process of creative work effectively in several books, including Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. Professors in Business have also started to explore the success factors for creative professionals including Harvard Business School Professor [[Teresa Amabile]] who has studied and published research on creative professionals like author John Irving &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mallory Stark and Martha Lagace|title=John Irving's Lessons for Business|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2000.html|year=2001|accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Corporate research and the development of products and services specifically for creative professionals has started to crop up as companies hire increasing numbers of creative professionals to compete on innovation. Recent changes to corporate slogans are indicative of the trend. In 2003, GE's slogan changed from "We Bring Good Things To Life" to "Imagination at Work" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McCarthy|title='Imagination at Work' for GE|publisher=USA TODAY|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2003-05-04-ge_x.htm|accessdate=2007-05-28 | date=2003-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hewlett Packard adopted the slogan "Invent."

Creativity, such as poetic creativity, has been an area of fascination for many ancient traditions.   For example, Nasadiya Sukta the Hindu creation hymn states "Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought, but who really knows how creation happened?".

'''Cultural intelligence''' or '''cultural quotient''' ('''CQ''') is a term used in business, education, government and academic research. Cultural intelligence can be understood as the capability to relate and work effectively across cultures. Originally, the term cultural intelligence and the abbreviation "CQ" was developed by the research done by Soon Ang and Linn Van Dyne as a researched-based way of measuring and predicting intercultural performance.

The term is relatively recent: early definitions and studies of the concepts were given by P. Christopher Earley and Soon Ang in the book ''Cultural Intelligence: Individual Interactions Across Cultures'' (2003) and more fully developed later by David Livermore in the book, ''Leading with Cultural Intelligence''. The concept is related to that of [[cross-cultural competence]].&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=James P. |author2=Tomasz Lenartowicz |author3=Salvador Apud|year=2006|title=Cross-Cultural Competence in International Business: Toward a Definition and a Model|journal=[[Journal of International Business Studies]]|volume=37|issue=4|pages=525–43|jstor=3875168}}&lt;/ref&gt; but goes beyond that to actually look at intercultural capabilities as a form of intelligence that can be measured and developed. According to Earley, Ang, and Van Dyne, cultural intelligence can be defined as "a person's capability to adapt as s/he interacts with others from different cultural
regions", and has behavioral, motivational, and metacognitive aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Earley|first=P. Christopher|editor=B. M. Staw|others=R. M. Kramer|title=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=24|year=2002|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|pages=271–99|chapter=Redefining interactions across cultures and organizations: moving forward with cultural intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without cultural intelligence, both business and military actors seeking to engage foreigners are susceptible to mirror imaging.&lt;ref name="pilon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilon|first=Juliana|title=Cultural Intelligence for Winning the Peace|year=2009|publisher=The Institute of World Politics Press|isbn=978-0-615-51939-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural intelligence or CQ is measured on a scale, similar to that used to measure an individual's intelligence quotient. People with higher CQs are regarded as better able to successfully blend into any environment, using more effective business practices, than those with a lower CQ. CQ is assessed using the academically validated assessment created by Linn Van Dyne and Soon Ang. Both self-assessments and multi-rater assessments are available through the Cultural Intelligence Center in East Lansing, Michigan and the Center makes the CQ Scale available to other academic researchers at no charge. Research demonstrates that CQ is consistent predictor of performance in multicultural settings.  Cultural intelligence research has been cited and peer reviewed in more than seventy academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ang &amp; Van Dyne|title=Handbook of Cultural Intelligence|year=2008|publisher=ME Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research and application of cultural intelligence is being driven by the Cultural Intelligence Center in the U.S. and Nanyang Business School in Singapore.

== Four CQ capabilities ==
Ang, Van Dyne, &amp; Livermore describe four CQ capabilities: motivation (CQ Drive), cognition (CQ Knowledge), meta-cognition (CQ Strategy) and behavior (CQ Action). CQ Assessments report scores on all four capabilities as well as several sub-dimensions for each capability. The four capabilities stem from the intelligence-based approach to intercultural adjustment and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livermore|first=David|title=Leading with Cultural Intelligence|year=2009|publisher=[[AMACOM]]|location=New York|isbn= 978-0814449172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;CQ-Drive
CQ-Drive is a person's interest and confidence in functioning effectively in culturally diverse settings. It includes:
* Intrinsic interest – deriving enjoyment from culturally diverse experiences
* Extrinsic interest – gaining benefits from culturally diverse experiences
* Self-efficacy – having the confidence to be effective in culturally diverse situations

;CQ-Knowledge
CQ-Knowledge is a person's knowledge about how cultures are similar and how cultures are different. It includes:
* Business – knowledge about economic and legal systems
* Interpersonal – knowledge about values, social interaction norms, and religious beliefs
* Socio-linguistics – knowledge about rules of languages and rules for expressing non-verbal behaviors

;CQ-Strategy
CQ-Strategy is how a person makes sense of culturally diverse experiences. It occurs when people make judgments about their own thought processes and those of others. It includes:
* Awareness – knowing about one's existing cultural knowledge;
* Planning – strategizing before a culturally diverse encounter;
* Checking – checking assumptions and adjusting mental maps when actual experiences differ from expectations.

;CQ-Action
CQ-Action is a person's capability to adapt verbal and nonverbal behavior to make it appropriate to diverse cultures. It involves having a flexible repertoire of behavioral responses that suit a variety of situations. It includes:
* Non-verbal – modifying non-verbal behaviors (e.g., gestures, facial expressions)
* Verbal – modifying verbal behaviors (e.g., accent, tone)

Additional research on cultural intelligence is being conducted by academics around the globe, including research on culturally intelligent organizations, the correlation between neuroscience and the development of cultural intelligence, and situational judgment making and CQ Assessment.

==In business==
Cultural intelligence, also known within business as "cultural quotient" or "CQ",  is a [[Business philosophy|theory]] within  [[management]] and [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organisational psychology]], positing that understanding the impact of an individual's [[culture|cultural background]] on their [[human behavior|behaviour]] is essential for effective [[business]], and measuring an individual's ability to engage successfully in any environment or social setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Christopher Earley and his wife Elaine Mosakowski in the October 2004 issue of ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' described cultural intelligence. CQ has been gaining acceptance throughout the business community. CQ teaches strategies to improve cultural perception in order to distinguish behaviours driven by culture from those specific to an individual, suggesting that allowing knowledge and appreciation of the difference to guide responses results in better business practice.

CQ is developed through:
* cognitive means: the head (learning about your own and other cultures, and [[cultural diversity]])
* physical means: the body (using your [[senses]] and adapting your movements and [[body language]] to blend in)
* motivational means: the emotions (gaining rewards and strength from acceptance and success)

Ilan Alon, Michele Boulange, Judith Meyer, and Vasyl Taras have developed a new survey they call the BCIQ (Business Cultural Intelligence Quotient). While not rooted in the academic literature of multiple loci of intelligence, the survey provides practitioners with a tool to reflect on their understanding for use in an international management context &lt;ref&gt;Alon, I., Boulanger, M., Meyers, J., Taras, V. (2016), "The Development and validation of the Business Cultural Intelligence Quotient", [[Cross Cultural &amp; Strategic Management]], Vol. 23, Iss. 1, pp. 78–100&lt;/ref&gt;

The only peer reviewed measurement of CQ is the multi-rater assessment developed by Soon Ang and Linn Van Dyne.

==In government==
Cultural intelligence refers to the cognitive, motivational, and behavioral capacities to understand and effectively respond to the beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals and groups under complex and changing circumstances in order to effect a desired change. The application and integration of cultural intelligence into the workings and practices of local government is advanced by community planner, Anindita Mitra in 2016 as a way to improve the effectiveness of local governments to respond to and serve a growing and diverse population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awcnet.org/TrainingEducation/Conferences/AnnualConference/Schedule.aspx|title=AWC &gt; Conference schedule|first=Association of Washington|last=Cities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural knowledge and warfare are bound together as cultural intelligence is central to ensuring successful military operations. Culture is composed of factors including language, society, economy, customs, history, and religion. For military operations, cultural intelligence concerns the ability to make decisions based an understanding of these factors.

In the military sense, cultural intelligence is a complicated pursuit of anthropology, psychology, communications, sociology, history, and above all, military doctrine.

=== Diplomatic implications ===

[[Diplomacy]] is the conduct by governmental officials of negotiations and other relations between nations. The use of cultural intelligence and other methods of [[soft power]] have been endorsed and encouraged as a primary tool of statecraft as opposed to more coercive forms of national power; its further development is being stressed as a primary exercise of power as opposed to the expensive (politically and financial) coercive options such as military action or economic sanctions. For example, in 2007, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] called for "strengthening our capacity to use 'soft' power and for better integrating it with 'hard' power," stating that using these other instruments "could make it less likely that military force will have to be used in the first place, as local problems might be dealt with before they become crises."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gates, speech made at Kansas State University in 2007, available at http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1199&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech in 2006, [[Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] urged similar actions in support of her doctrine of "[[transformational diplomacy]];"&lt;ref&gt;Condoleezza Rice, speech made a Georgetown University in 2006, available at http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/59306.htm&lt;/ref&gt; she made a similar speech, again, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Condoleezza Rice, speech made at Georgetown in 2008, available at http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/204028-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental [[negotiation]] and other diplomatic efforts can be made much more effective if knowledge of a peoples is understood and practiced with skill. [[Joseph Nye]], a leading [[political scientist]], asserts in his book ''Soft Power'' that "a country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref&gt;Nye, Joseph. Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The sorts of effects Nye describes are much more effective if there is a willingness on the part of the influencing agent to respect and understand the other agent's cultural background. An example of diplomacy was a provision within the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] "condemning discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans" response to the events of [[9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;USA PATRIOT Act (U.S. H.R. 3162, Public Law 107-56), available at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/html/PLAW-107publ56.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This provision ensures the protection of U.S. Muslims and Arabs, ensures a distinction between them and those that committed those terrorist acts, and lives up to the ideals of the U.S. constitution of non-discrimination. This precedent sets up an attitude of an awareness of and respect for peaceful, law-abiding Muslims.

However, cultural intelligence can be used to the opposite effect. In 2006 and 2007, [[Russia]]n president [[Vladimir Putin]] used his knowledge of [[Germany|German]] chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and her fear of dogs to intimidate her during negotiations by bringing his [[Labrador Retriever]], Koni.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy Magazine Blog, available at http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2007/06/14/putin_uses_dog_to_intimidate_merkel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel, available at http://www.spiegel.de/international/putin-merkel-summit-germany-and-russia-try-to-smooth-over-energy-tensions-a-461249.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the U.S. military==
Cultural Intelligence as a U.S. military term did not gain prominence until the late 20th century with the rise of low-intensity and [[counterinsurgency]] warfare. However, the importance of cultural intelligence has only recently become commonly accepted with the counterinsurgency campaigns the U.S. has conducted in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="pilon"/&gt;

Since the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], cultural intelligence is being seen as playing a more important role in the success of military operations in [[counterinsurgency]]. The [[U.S. Army]] and [[Marine Corps]] Counterinsurgency Field manual is explicit on this point:

"Cultural knowledge is essential to waging a successful counterinsurgency," and goes further, urging "counterinsurgents… should strive to avoid imposing their ideals of normalcy on a foreign cultural problem."&lt;ref name="everyspec.com"&gt;U.S. Army Field Manual No. 3-24, available at http://www.everyspec.com/ARMY/FM-Field-Manual/FM_3-24_15DEC2006_13424/&lt;/ref&gt;

The manual's logic is that the "primary goal of any COIN operation is to foster development of effective governance by legitimate government."&lt;ref name="everyspec.com"/&gt; And the manual points out that different cultures have different ideas of what legitimacy entails, and that operations at building legitimacy need to meet the host nation's peoples' criteria. Failure to recognize and respect a host nation's culture has resulted in the deaths of some NATO troops, and attempts have been made to make Afghans aware of Western culture and vice versa to mitigate some of these unintentional effects.&lt;ref&gt;NATO Troops killed over cultural insensitivities, available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghan-troops-get-a-lesson-in-american-cultural-ignorance/2012/09/28/6882621a-08d4-11e2-a10c-fa5a255a9258_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; But the cultural attitudes of the host nation's peoples aren't the only consideration. The culture of the insurgents is crucial as well – for that information helps to develop "effective programs that attack the insurgency's root causes."  In this way, this information helps to shape counterinsurgent military operations.

=== Human Terrain System ===

To this effect, the U.S. Army developed the [[Human Terrain System]] in February 2007 to provide cultural information of host nations. The HTS program was the primary unified effort to provide this information to supplement military operations in areas where armed services were deployed. The program was also controversial, with the [[American Anthropological Association]] arguing that such efforts represented a conflict of interest and a possible violation of the ethical standards of anthropologists;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101015936/http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was defended by others as ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Militarys-Human-Terrain/49345/|title=Military's Human-Terrain Program Might Be Ethical, Philosopher Says|first=David|last=Glenn|date=3 December 2009|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. Army Human Terrain System ended operations in September 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4486">In [[marketing]] and [[microeconomics]], '''customer switching''' or '''consumer switching''' describes "[[customer]]s/[[consumer]]s abandoning a product or service in favor of a [[competitor]]".&lt;ref name=smallbusi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/concept-consumerswitching-behavior-65092.html|title=Concept of Consumer-Switching Behavior|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming constant [[price]], [[product quality|product]] or [[service quality]], counteracting this behaviour in order to achieve maximal [[customer retention]] is the business of marketing, [[public relations]] and [[advertising]]. '''Brand switching'''—as opposed to [[brand loyalty]] is the outcome of ''customer switching behaviour''.

==Reasons==
Variability in quality or market [[price fluctuation]]s—especially a rise in [[price]]s—may lead customers to consult [[price comparison]] services where alternative suppliers may be offered. Declining [[customer satisfaction]] may be due to poor service quality but also—to a lesser degree—be a symptom of boredom with the brand of choice.&lt;ref name=smallbusi/&gt; Brand loyalty can be very strong, however, and the longer a commitment to a brand lasts, the stronger the ties will usually be.

According to 2013 Nielsen study on [[customer loyalty]], brand switching can happen for 5 main reasons, but mainly based on price considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/the-price-is-right-incentives-that-stimulate-switching-behavior.html|title=The Price is Right: Incentives That Stimulate Switching Behavior|publisher=Nielsen|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall global averages are:
# Better Price (41%)
# Better Quality (26%)
# Better [[Service Agreement]] (15%)
# Better Selection (10%)
# Better Features (8%)

Because of the dominant role of pricing, market tactics like [[penetration pricing]] have evolved to offer a convincing incentive for switching. Along with these are the factors like service inconvenience, poor location, ethical issues like [[hard selling]] or unsafe products and also change in customers' income levels.  Another approach is the advertisement of [[vaporware]] that seemingly will offer newer or better features than established products without actually possessing any [[innovation]].

==Affected sectors==
Switching is a significant business factor affecting [[revenue]]s for companies providing ''continuously delivered services'', as is the case for the [[energy market]] as opposed to [[economic sector|sectors]] providing products that stimulate non- or sparsely recurring purchase because of the durability of the product or a general orientation towards casual customers.&lt;ref name=smallbusi/&gt; [[Energy customer switching]] is a significant risk or success factor for [[energy supplier]]s.

==Serial switching==
The term '''serial switcher''' was first coined by Charles Turner and David Alexander in their [[Customer relationship management]] course and then their CRM Pocketbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=PcM1WnOPuRsC&amp;dq=Charles+Turner+and+David+Alexander&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=16qTbxOmrE&amp;sig=WhaFVfDsJJQLG0k5opnFn2teXBc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 |title=CRM Pocketbook |publisher=Books.google.com |year=2001 |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a person who continually moves his/her patronage from one company to another and highlights the ignorance of many organisations, including credit card companies, who strive for customer acquisition regardless of [[Customer retention|retention]] rates.

By offering a range of financial incentives, such as free [[balance transfer]]s or interest free periods, a company may hope to attract new customers. This is superficially attractive to companies if it meets acquisition and competitive switching targets.  In practice, however, a serial switcher will not contribute any profit if he/she does not stay long enough to provide a return on investments.  The lesson is that lack of integration and analysis across the business allows bad decisions to be made.

'''Digital Data Systems''', or '''DDS''', was a leading solutions provider and consultancy firm specializing in [[operations support systems]] (OSS) and [[business support system]]s (BSS) in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) and carrier marketplace within the telecommunications industry. DDS was an independent provider of OSS and BSS during a time when such systems were provided by the large telecommunications switch vendors. It completed in OSS / BSS head-to-head against AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom (now Nortel Networks), and others in providing services that sold and deployed amongst the [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]], including: [[Bell Atlantic]], [[Southwestern Bell]], and [[Pacific Telesis]]. It had a hardware joint venture with [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS Computer Systems]] who provided the hardware platform upon which it ran. The business was acquired by [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (CSC) in 1992.

==Products and Services==
In addition to consulting services, the Company had two products: MATCH and DETECT.

===MATCH===
The Match product provided automated systems for telephone companies in [[Operations, administration and management]] (OA&amp;M) to migrate telephone services delivered by existings analogue AT&amp;T 1AESS switches to newer digital switches, such as [[Northern Telecom]]'s [[DMS-100]] or [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[5ESS]] switches. The MATCH was composed of three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the [[AT&amp;T]] [[1AESS]], 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including [[COSMOS (telecommunications)|COSMOS]] and [[TIRKS]].  Network inventory, services, and related constructs would be stored in a proprietary MATCH universal [[database management system]], which was configurable based on job and customer preferences. The Matching module would compare two populated databases, being a source and target, and compute the functional transform required to bring the target system in line with the source. The Provisioning model examined the transform function and generated the necessary AT&amp;T 5AESS recent change messages and DMS-100 service updates to reproduce telephony services provided by the old switch on the new switching platform.

===DETECT===
The DETECT product utilized the Decoding and Matching modules of the MATCH product and brought in data records from [[RBOC]] [[telecommunications billing]] systems. Given the manual nature of service provisioning through the [[Recent change memory administration center|RCMAC]] at the time, many services were provisioned-but-unbilled by [[RBOC]]s. DETECT would identify provisioned-but-unbilled services and optionally generate the necessary machine instructions to recapture leaking revenue. The DETECT product detected over multi-million in revenue leakage often found in large centrex groups of multinational corporations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1610">{{See also|Indirect costs}}
'''Direct costs''' are costs which are directly accountable to a [[cost object]] (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Some overhead costs which can be directly attributed to a project (e.g. a designated project manager) may also be classified as a direct cost.

Direct costs are directly attributable to the object. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. In manufacturing or other non-construction industries, the portion of operating costs which is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY TCM Framework: General Reference,'' Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International, 2010, Pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs are those for activities or services that benefit specific projects, for example salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project. Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis.

Direct costs typically include:
*Direct materials used in manufacturing
*Direct labour
*Direct expenses, e.g. a [[royalty payment]] to a [[patent holder]] for a specific production process &lt;ref&gt;[[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply|CIPS]] (2106), ''Procurement and supply workflow'', published by Profex Publishing Ltd., p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Document imaging''' is an [[information technology]] category for systems capable of replicating documents commonly used in business. Document imaging systems can take many forms including [[microfilm]], on demand printers, [[facsimile machine]]s, [[copier]]s, [[multifunction printer]]s, [[Image scanner#Document processing|document scanners]], computer output microfilm (COM) and archive writers. Document Imaging means the conversion of paper files (of any size or description) or microfilm / fiche to digital images.

==Document management==
Document imaging is a part of [[enterprise content management]]. In the early days of content management technologies, the term "document imaging" was used interchangeably with "document image management" as the industry tried to separate itself from the micrographic and reprographic technologies.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In the late 1980s, a new document management technology emerged: [[Electronic document management system|electronic document management]]. This technology was built around the need to manage and secure the escalating volume of electronic documents ([[spreadsheet]]s, [[word processing|word-processing]] documents, [[PDF]]s, [[Email|e-mails]]) generated in organizations.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Identity document scanning==
Customer [[identity document]] scanning and storage is used for the purpose of age verification, identifying barred members and identifying individuals to the authorities in the case of criminal incidents. They are typically used at [[nightclubs]], [[casino]]s, music venues, and many entities governed under the US [[Customer Identification Program]] (CIP) &lt;ref&gt;Efficiently Check ID with Passport Scanning, Alaris, https://www.alarisworld.com/en-us/insights/articles/secure-passport-scanning&lt;/ref&gt;.

Systems used include Id Scan Biometrics's ''Scan Net'' and ID Vista products.{{r|id1}} Id Scan Biometrics system was developed by Tamlyn Thompson in 2005.{{CN|date=April 2016}}

===United Kingdom nightclubs===
UK licensing authorities are increasingly requiring [[nightclub]]s to scan and retain clubbers' ID details. Privacy and data security concerns have been raised by customers and the protest group [[NO2ID]].{{r|id1|id2|id3}} For example, '''Clubscan''' was an [[ID card]] scanning system invented invented in 2003.{{CN|date=April 2016}} It took scanned images of [[nightclub]] patrons' ID documents and stored their personal details, for the purpose of age verification, identifying barred members and identifying individuals to the authorities in the case of criminal incidents. Clubscan is now discontinued and replaced by [[SCAN NET]] (the Safer Clubbing At Night Network) and serving over 1200 connected venues in the UK.

===Proof of delivery (POD)===
POD receipt can be generated into a digital image and full POD status report is generated into an excel spreadsheet. With e-retrieval of shipping documents,&lt;ref&gt;Art Zipkin, DDC FPO, http://ddcfpo.com/solutions/pod-retrieval&lt;/ref&gt; basic functions are dimensionalized, and newly streamlined administrative operations suddenly become a very strategic step in a business model.

'''Electronic billing''' or '''electronic bill payment and presentment''', is when a [[seller]] such as company, organization, or group sends its bills or [[invoice]]s over the [[internet]], and customers [[electronic bill payment|pay the bills electronically]].&lt;ref name="What is Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/EBPP.html|title=What is EBPP (electronic bill presentment and payment)?|publisher=webopedia.com|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This replaces the traditional method where invoices were sent in paper form and payments were done by manual means such as sending [[cheques]].

There are a number of advantages to electronic billing that include the faster presentation of invoices and reductions in costs in handling paper document.  However to take full advantage of electronic billing both seller and buyer need to have in place computer systems able to handle electronic billing and have access to financial institutions that can do [[electronic payment]]s.

==History==
The development of electronic billing and payments started in late 20th century, and went hand in hand with development of [[internet banking]], introduction of [[accounting software]] and widespread use of the [[email]].

In the United States, the Council for Electronic Billing and Payment of the [[National Automated Clearing House Association]] (NACHA) is credited with broadly promoting and communicating various forms of electronic billing in the early 2000s. NACHA promoted activities and initiatives that facilitated the adoption of electronic payments in the areas of Internet commerce, electronic bill payment and presentment, financial [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), international payments, electronic checks, [[Electronic Benefit Transfer|electronic benefits transfer]] (EBT) and student lending. Certain electronic billing applications also provide the ability to electronically settle payment for goods or services.

==Different types==
* Biller-direct - This refers to an approach in which consumers make payments directly to one biller that issues bills that they receive at the website of the firm that issued the bill. An example would be of a [[public utility]] company offering this payment service to its consumers.  A market has emerged for outsourced billing providers who specialize in electronic billing processes and technology for companies that need to send bills directly to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aitegroup.com/report/biller-direct-and-walk-bill-pay-update Aite Group independent research firm report on biller-direct vendors by Gwenn Bezard. August 29, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Bank-aggregator - The approach under this model is to make payment at an aggregator or consolidator site, usually from a consumer's [[online banking|bank’s website]]. This model allows the consumer to make payments to multiple billers that are pre-registered to receive payments. An example in the UK is [[OneVu]] or [https://www.e-bill.ch/en/E-bill-Receive-check-and-pay-bills-in-your-e-banking-system-108.html%20eBills eBills] in Switzerland..

==Parties involved==
Billers, bankers, aggregators and consolidators can play various roles in the overall process. Once roles are defined, it is easier to identify which model is most appropriate for the client's strategy. Billers may also implement more than one model in order to best serve their clients. Because the industry is continuously changing and redefining, the options and opportunities will continue to expand.

*Biller payment provider (BPP) - An agent of the biller that accepts remittance information on behalf of the Biller. 
*Biller service provider (BSP) - An agent of the biller that provides the service for the Biller. 
*Consolidator - A biller service provider that consolidates bills from multiple Billers or other bill service providers (BSPs) and delivers them for presentment to the customer service provider (CSP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisolutionswiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Internet_Banking_Systems_Vendors#Bill_Payment_&amp;_Presentment_Vendors Information on several solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Customer service provider (CSP) – An agent of the customer that provides an interface directly to customers, businesses or others for bill presentment. CSP enrolls customers, enables presentment and provides customer care, among other functions.

== Slow development due to legacy systems ==
In developed countries existing legacy banking systems and rules has slowed down the development of electronic billing.  For example in the United States financial institutions typically formally prohibit the use of their consumer electronic bill payment systems for payments to certain agencies such as: collection agencies, or recipients of court-ordered payments like child support or alimony. Any organizations or individuals outside of the United States are also usually excluded. Payments to government agencies for utilities such as water are usually permitted.

Electronic bill pay systems fall into two categories, "pay-anyone" services and restricted biller list services.  In a pay-anyone service, the provider will facilitate a payment to the payee regardless of whether they have an electronic connection with that payee or not.  If they cannot deliver the payment to the payee electronically, they will print and mail a paper check on the payer's behalf.  The largest providers of electronic bill pay services can deliver about 80% of their payments electronically, so 20% of payments facilitated by the large pay-anyone services are still made by mailing a paper check to the biller.  This is the primary reason why some billers in a pay-anyone service require as much as a 5-day lead time for the payment to reach the payee.

Restricted biller list payment services allow you to pay any biller that is in the provider's network, and in these services where the provider has an electronic relationship with the biller, the payments will be delivered electronically.

The term '''empowerment''' refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

The term empowerment originates from American [[community psychology]] and is associated{{by whom|date=June 2016}} with the social scientist [[Julian Rappaport]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Julian. In praise of paradox. A social policy of empowerment over prevention, in: American Journal of Community Psychology, Vol. 9 (1), 1981, 1–25 (13)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compsy.org.uk/rethemp.htm|title=Rethinking empowerment: shared action against powerlessness|last=Burton &amp; Kagan|first=|date=1996|website=compsy.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social work]], empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and [[democratic education]], empowerment is seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting [[civic engagement]]. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a [[wikt:deficit|deficit]]-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of [[continuing education]] and [[self-help]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Empowerment Group. (1989, October). Empowerment and family support. Networking Bulletin, 1(1)2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with [[feminism]].

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for [[marginalized]] people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, [[self-sufficiency]], with a focus on eliminating the future need for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own [[nonprofit organization]], using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, "Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out."&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt;  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female "...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2273|title=Encouraging and Empowering Girls - Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association|date=13 July 2012|website=Ccpa-accp.ca|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [[mentally ill]] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lenz: ''Empowerment und Ressourcenaktivierung – Perspektiven für die psychosoziale Praxis.''&lt;/ref&gt; It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

== In social work and community psychology ==
[[File:Altenheim 12.jpg|thumb|Empowerment in the work for senior citizens in a residential home in Germany]]
In [[social work]], empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. "[[Marginalized]]" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.
The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents’ experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of [[Milton Friedman]] embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microempowering.org |title=Welcome to MicroEmpowering! |publisher=Microempowering.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has argued that large [[institutional investor]]s such as [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the [[legal mobilisation]] i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the [[law]] to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=Odi.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO)  "Legal empowerment is about [[Capacity building|strengthening the capacity]] of all people to exercise their [[rights]], either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that [[law]] is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/legal-empowerment|title=What Is Legal Empowerment?|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' ''Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control'' ' outlines the fact that [[Law|legal tools]] for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The [[legal system|state legal system]] is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, ''lack of [[legal awareness]] as well as [[legal aid|legal assistance]] '' tend to be recurrent problems.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the [[law]], and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools',  is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like [[legal literacy]] and awareness training, broadcasting [[legal information]], conducting participatory [[legal discourse]]s, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] with [[advocacy]] along with media engagement, and socio [[legal mobilisation]].&lt;ref name=Cotula /&gt;

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and [[women's empowerment]] through lobbying.

==Gender==
{{main|Gender empowerment|Women empowerment}}
[[Gender empowerment]] conventionally refers to the [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by [[feminism]] and employed legal empowerment by building on international [[human rights]]. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights]] and [[International development|development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]] targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|website=Un.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield,&lt;ref&gt;Potterfield, Thomas. "The Business of Employee Empowerment: Democracy and Ideology in the Workplace." Quorum Books, 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular [[Management fad|management concepts]] of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of [[Counterfeit|bogus]] empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ciulla| first = Joanne B.| chapter = Leadership and the Problem of Bogus Empowerment| editor-last = Ciulla| editor-first = Joanne B.| title = Ethics, the heart of leadership| edition = 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| publication-date = 2004| isbn = 978-0-275-98248-5| quote = [...] in many organizations, promises of empowerment are bogus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In management===
In the sphere of [[management]] and organizational theory, "empowerment" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or [[worker]]s generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the [http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views] of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as "empowerment circle" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of [[quality circles]] to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, [[knowledge management]] contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/empowering-your-employees-to-e|title=Empowering Your Employees to Empower Themselves |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1998/05/empowerment-the-emperors-new-clothes|title=Empowerment: The Emperor’s New Clothes |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulhost.com/employee-empowerment|title=Employee Empowerment: The Key to Employee Satisfaction|publisher=AtulHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book ''Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute'', the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# [[information sharing|Share information]] with everyone
# Create [[autonomy]] through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with [[self-directed work team]]s

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the "right kind of [[authority]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;6).  To summarize, "empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Aileen Mitchell. ''Empowering People'' (Institute of Management). Pitman. London: Financial Times Management, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace.  It is important to [[workplace training|train]] employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blanchard, Kenneth H.|author2=John P. Carlos|author3=Alan Randolph|title=Empowerment Takes More than a Minute|publisher=San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/05/6-myths-about-empowering-employees|title=6 Myths About Empowering Employees |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Age of Popular Empowerment?==

[[Marshall McLuhan]] insisted that the development of [[electronic media]] would eventually weaken the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “[[Descartes|linear-Cartsesian”]] forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="youtube1977"&gt;{{cite news|last1= McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=‘ABC TV Monday Conference: The Medium is the Message (Part 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= ABC TV Monday Conference|publisher=ABC TV Monday Conference|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by [[information technology]] would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in [[real-time computing|near-real-time]] vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education &lt;ref name="youtube1977"/&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-driven]] public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"/&gt;

An '''independent director''' (also sometimes known as an '''outside director''') is a director (member) of a board of directors who does not have a material or pecuniary relationship with company or related persons, except sitting fees. In the US, independent outsiders make up 66% of all boards and 72% of [[S&amp;P 500]] company boards, according to [[The Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamkeenconsult.com/pdf/dna2_v1.pdf Corporate Governance on an International Level, Tamkeen, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal requirements ==
=== United States ===
The [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] and [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange standards for independent directors are similar. Both require that "a majority of the board of directors of a listed company be 'independent,'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.findlaw.com/finance/sec-approves-nyse-and-nasdaq-proposals-relating-to-director.html SEC Approves NYSE and NASDAQ Proposals Relating to Director Independence]| corporate.findlaw.com| 2008-03-26&lt;/ref&gt; Both allow compensation for directors of $120,000/year or less (as of August 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chadbourne.com/clientalerts/2008/defofinddir/ Client Alert. Nasdaq and NYSE Amend Definition of Independent Director]| Chadbourne &amp; Parke| 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;)

The NYSE states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"no director qualifies as 'independent' unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has 'no material relationship' with the listed company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company."&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://tcbblogs.org/governance/2010/09/10/just-what-is-an-independent-director-anyway/ Just What is an Independent Director Anyway? ] Governance Center Blog, The Conference Board&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nasdaq's rules say that an independent director must not be an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.&lt;ref name=whatis/&gt;

According to the Conference Board, "other than [[Listing (finance)|delisting]] a company ... there really is no penalty" by the stock exchanges or the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] for not having enough independent directors.&lt;ref name=whatis/&gt;

=== India ===
In India as of 2017, a majority of the minimum two directors of public companies having share capital in excess of Rs. 100&amp;nbsp;million (Rs 100,000,000) should be independent. Clause 49 of the listing agreements defines independent directors as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"For the purpose of this clause the expression 'independent directors' means directors who apart from receiving director's remuneration, do not have any other material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company, its promoters, its management or its subsidiaries, which in judgment of the board may affect independence of judgment of the directors."&lt;ref name=wcfcg&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100619130652/http://www.wcfcg.net/ht130304.htm Are we making a mockery of independent directors?] Dr. Madhav Mehra, President, World Council for Corporate Governance (circa 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Companies Act, 2013]], most sections of which got implemented from 1 April 2014, has mandated all listed public companies to have at least one-third of the total Directors to be independent. Whereas in the case of unlisted public companies, the following class of companies shall have at least two directors as independent directors:

(i)   Public Companies having paid up share capital of Ten Crore rupees or more; or
(ii)  Public Companies having turnover of One Hundred Crore rupees or more; or
(iii) Public Companies which have, in aggregate, outstanding loans, debentures and deposits exceeding 50 Crore rupees or more.

The Companies Act, 2013 is drafted taking into consideration the noteworthy inputs and contribution that an Independent Director can bring in to the business. Section 149(6) of the act stipulates the criteria for a candidate that ensures highest standards of integrity, while also preventing any conflict of interest. The provisions seek to ensure the autonomy of the appointee to facilitate effective discharge of duties such as upholding shareholders' interest, upholding corporate governance standards, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf Companies Act 2013] p.91&lt;/ref&gt; The compensation offered to such Independent Directors in the form of "sitting fee" has also been increased from Rs. 20,000 (prescribed by Companies Act, 1956) to a maximum of Rs. 1,00,000/- per meeting.

The requirements in Kenya are similar to those in India. (These are to be found in the Companies Act, Cap 486 Laws of Kenya).&lt;George Kinyua, LL.B&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Some researchers have complained that firms have appointed "independent directors who are overly sympathetic to
management, while still technically independent according to regulatory definitions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.hbs.edu/lcohen/pdffiles/malcofrazIII.pdf Hiring Cheerleaders: Board Appointments of "Independent" Directors] Lauren Cohen, Andrea Frazzini
Christopher J. Malloy&lt;/ref&gt;

One complaint against the independence regulations is that CEOs may find loopholes to influence directors. While the NYSE has a $1 million limit on business dealing between directors and the firm, this does not include charitable contributions. Two critics of management influence over boards note that "a director who is an officer or employee of a charitable organization can still be considered independent even if the firm on whose board the director sits contributes more than $1 million to that organization."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDDnbxaleNsC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=As+for+charitable+contributions,+the+NYSE+standards+make+it+clear&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QIBVRne2wb&amp;sig=yA4Qie5Rp8OQxrlczVEhXHfYOMo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=84JjUN61MYjFyAGpjYH4Dw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pay Without Performance: The Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation]'' By Lucian Arye Bebchuk, Jesse M.

      <comment>Deleted two from the list of MVNEs as they are not MVNE but MVNO and there was no reference</comment>

A '''mobile virtual network enabler''' ('''MVNE''') is a company that provides network infrastructure and related services, such as business support systems, administration and operations support systems to a [[Mobile Virtual Network Operator]] (MVNO).  This enables MVNOs to offer services to their own customers with their own brands. The MVNE does not have a relationship with consumers, but rather is a provider of network enablement platforms and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/mvne-mobile-virtual-network-enabler|title=Gartner Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MVNEs specialise in planning, implementation and management of mobile services. Typically this includes SIM provisioning and configuration, customer billing, customer relationship management and value-added service platforms. In effect, they enable an MVNO to outsource both the initial integration with the MNO and the ongoing business and technical operations management. A related type of company is [[mobile virtual network aggregator]], or MVNA. MVNE is a telecom solution, whereas MVNA is a business model which includes wholesale of an operator's airtime and routing of traffic over the MVNE's own switches. 

The benefits of using an MVNE include a reduction in the upfront capital expenses of an MVNO, financing arrangements offered by MVNEs to cover start-up costs and reduced wholesale airtime costs achieved through economies of scale of hosting multiple MVNOs on a single MVNE platform. The other benefits could be reduced operational expenses by outsourcing management of business and technical operations, smoother launch processes and benefiting from previous experience of the MVNE as a negotiating channel for smaller MVNOs to reach a wholesale agreement with the MNO.

However, not all MVNEs are the same. There is significant variation in the level of experience, technical capability, integration and operational support. Furthermore, using an MVNE may not be appropriate for all MVNOs. The considerations for this decision are manifold, however, some of the key reasons for an MVNO against using an MVNE are:
* The MVNO is large enough to achieve volume efficiency when going direct to the host operator (usually several hundred thousand subscribers);
* The brand and distribution channels are sufficiently strong to negotiate a joint-venture or direct relationship and obtain better margins;
* The MVNO has access to existing telecoms infrastructure, for example switches, international capacity, fixed infrastructure and billing platforms.

Adoption of the MVNE model will have a significant impact on the margins of an MVNO business, acting either to improve or shrink these margins relative to direct or self-build models. As such, the decision to use an MVNE should not be taken lightly as the impacts could range from customer experience to business efficiency.

'''MyLocalPitch''' is an [[internet booking engine]] that enables people to book grassroots sports facilities online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityam.com/223424/sporty-airbnb-app-gets-ftse-approval-ahead-launch-date|title=Sporty AirBnB app gets FTSE approval|date=2 September 2015|work=CityAM.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is headquartered in the United Kingdom with offices in Holborn, [[London]]. The service is free to users and is currently available in London, Manchester and Dublin.

==History==
MyLocalPitch was founded in January 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://startups.co.uk/tech-pitch-mylocalpitch/ |title=Tech Pitch: MyLocalPitch|date=13 June 2017|work=Startups.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Jamie Foale and Sandford Loudon after struggling to find and book sports pitches for their 11-a-side football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://getwestlondon.co.uk/news/business/friends-set-up-business-make-9256813/|title=Friends set up business to make life easier for amateur sports enthusiasts|date=14 May 2015|work=Getwestlondon.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site started by listing London based sports venues before expanding into [[Dublin]] in March 2015.

In November 2015 the MyLocalPitch [[iPhone]] App was released to market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tntmagazine.com/entertainment/mylocalpitch-app-launch/|title=MyLocalPitch launches App|date=2 September 2015|work=TNTMagazine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable users to book and search for venues on the move using geolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.mylocalpitch.com/mylocalpitch-app-impulsive-sport-at-its-best/|title=Impulsive sports booking|date=20 January 2016|work=MyLocalPitch.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MyLocalPitch initiated its 'Outstanding London Sports Venue Award'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://islingtongazette.co.uk/news/award_for_market_road_pitches_in_islington_1_4300449|title=Award for Market Road Pitches in Islington|date=6 November 2015|work=Islingtongazette.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 to recognise outstanding sports facilities for services provided and their role in the community. March's award was claimed by Westway Sport and Fitness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://londonsport.org/news/westway-sports-and-fitness-march-outstanding-london-sports-venue-award/|title=Award for Westway-Sports-and-Fitness-March-Outstanding-London-Sports-Venue-Award|date=13 April 2016|work=Londonsport.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; and April's went to Playfootball Romford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/sport/football/playfootball_romford_get_mylocalpitch_outstanding_london_sports_venue_award_1_4531364/|title=PlayFootball-Romford-get-MyLocalPitch-Outstanding-London-Sports-Venue-award|date=11 May 2016|work=Romfordrecorder.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April MyLocalPitch received a 2016 [[Sports Technology Awards]] nomination for the Best Technology to Promote Participation category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportstechnologyawards.com/shortlist/|title=2016-Sports-Technology-Awards-Shortlist|date=15 April 2016|work=Sportstechnologyawards.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an extension of [[Sport England]]'s new strategy to increase sports participation, MyLocalPitch has introduced bespoke borough pages to further speed up the booking process. A few examples can be seen for Clapham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.totallyclapham.co.uk/other-sports/|title=Sports Clubs &amp; Centres in Clapham|date=14 February 2017|work=TotallyClapham }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/mylocalpitch_app_aims_to_streamline_process_of_booking_sports_venues_1_4558043|title=MyLocalPitch app aims to streamline process of booking sports venues|date=1 June 2016|work=Islington Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hackney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/mylocalpitch_app_aims_to_streamline_process_of_booking_sports_venues_1_4558089|title=MyLocalPitch app aims to streamline process of booking sports venues|date=1 June 2016|work=Hackney Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt; and St Albans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hertsad.co.uk/sport/new_website_launched_to_make_accessing_sport_in_st_albans_and_harpenden_easier_1_4715969|title=New website launched to make accessing sport in St Albans and Harpenden easier|date=2 October 2016|work=The Herts Advertiser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 MyLocalPitch started working with Brighton Aldridge Community Academy to bring the service to Brighton.

As 2017 drew to a close MyLocalPitch signed as London FA's official Bookings Partner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.londonfa.com/news/2017/dec/mylocalpitch-signs-as-london-fas-official-bookings-partner||title=MyLocalPitch signs as London FA's official Bookings Partner|date=4 December 2017|work=LondonFA.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the Middlesex FA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.middlesexfa.com/news/2018/mar/01/mylocalpitch-teams-up-with-middlesex-fa-to-become-its-official-bookings-partner||title=MyLocalPitch signs as Middlesex FA's official Bookings Partner|date=1 March 2018|work=MiddlesexFA.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; to grow participation numbers.

At the start of 2018 MyLocalPitch became the first London-based SportsTech business to raise more than £1 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businesscloud.co.uk/news/chelseas-graeme-le-saux-joins-mylocalpitch||title=FORMER CHELSEA STAR GRAEME LE SAUX JOINS NEW TEAM|date=23 March 2018|work=businesscloud.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Graeme Le Saux joined the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bqlive.co.uk/london-the-south/2018/03/22/news/graeme-le-saux-joins-mylocalpitch-following-1m-investment-31340/||title=GRAEME LE SAUX JOINS MYLOCALPITCH FOLLOWING £1M INVESTMENT|date=23 March 2018|work=BQlive.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, the Football Foundation, the largest sports charity in the UK, has teamed up with MyLocalPitch to roll out its innovative booking portal for community football venues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/sport/football/football-foundation-teams-up-with-mylocakpitch-1-5635948||title=Football Foundation teams up with MyLocalPitch|date=2 August 2018|work=islingtongazette.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Nightclub management software''' ('''NMS''') or a '''nightclub management system''' is a compiled [[management information system]] produced solely for [[night club|nightclubs]], such as the [[ministry of sound|Ministry Of Sound]], and can also be modified for [[bar (establishment)|bars]], [[arts festival|festivals]], [[Public house|pubs]], and [[concert|live events]]. These systems will commonly cover the needs of [[night club|nightclubs]] in the form of CRM, bookings, ticketing, [[point of sale|EPOS]], and administration capabilities for running the [[Music venue|venue]]. With the Nightclub industry in contraction during the period of [[great recession|recession]] during 2007-2009 many nightclubs are sourcing new avenues for marketing reach expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ibis World|title=Nightclubs in the UK: Market Research Report|url=http://www.ibisworld.co.uk/market-research/nightclubs.html|work=Market Research|date=2015-07-01|accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Nightclub management software solutions typically cover a broad spectrum of aspects in running a venue such as:
*Tracking Bookings
*Stock Management
*Electronic point of sale terminals

The standard NMS forgoes the traditional software installation and instead relies on cloud computing storing all data on remote servers which allow for user access for an unlimited number of computers based anywhere within reach of an internet connection. Many NMS providers base the pricing structure from a [[software as a service]]/[[application service provider]] model.

Nightclubs use specific software to meet the complex requirements of their business. Typically small scale venues will manage their business with a generic accounting package and extend functionality with plugin's or other bolt-on software. The advantage for nightclubs running a specialized system are numerous, however the primary outcome is a more efficient venue. Nightclub Management software typically encompasses all the tools mentioned above however difficulty arises when nightclub staff are evaluating vendors and deciding what software to implement. Integration of these tools is key but venue principals and other key staff still need to pay attention to other factors such as cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15265">A '''non-executive director''' (abbreviated to '''non-exec''', '''NED''' or '''NXD'''), '''independent director''' or '''external director''' is a member of the [[board of directors]] of a [[company]] or [[organisation]], but not a member of the executive management team. They are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way and are differentiated from [[executive director]]s, who are members of the board who also serve, or previously served, as executive managers of the company (most often as [[corporate officer]]s). However they do have the same legal duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities as their executive counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.iod.com/MainWebSite/Resources/Document/roleofnxds_1006.pdf|title = The role of the non-executive director|date = 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = Institute of Directors|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150404182211/http://www.iod.com/MainWebSite/Resources/Document/roleofnxds_1006.pdf|archivedate = 4 April 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Business Journalism: How to Report on Business and Economics|last = Hayes|first = Keith|publisher = Apress|year = 2014|isbn = 1-4302-6349-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coachdirectors.co.uk/executive-coaching/|title=Executive Coaching|work=CoachDirectors|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-executive directors provide independent oversight and serve on committees concerned with sensitive issues such as the pay of the executive directors and other senior managers; they are usually paid a fee for their services but are not regarded as employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Professional Issues in Information Technology - Second edition|last = Bott|first = Frank|publisher = BCS Learning &amp; Development Limited|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-78017-180-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All directors should be capable of seeing company and business issues in a broad perspective. Nonetheless, non-executive directors are usually chosen because of their independence and initiative, are of an appropriate caliber and have particular personal qualities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Role==
Fundamentally, the non-executive director role is to provide a creative contribution and improvement to the board by providing dispassionate and objective criticism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their role may change depending on the organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bupa.com/corporate/about-us/corporate-governance/role-of-the-non-executive-director|title = Role of the Non-Executive Director|date = |accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = BUPA|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Get Started in Shares|last = Arnold|first = Glen|publisher = FT Publishing International|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-273-77122-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are usually not involved in the day-to-day management of the company but monitor the executive activity and contribute to the development strategy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mondaq.com/x/96906/Directors+Officers/The+Increasing+Importance+Of+NonExecutive+Directors|title = The Increasing Importance Of Non-Executive Directors|date = 29 March 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = mondaq|publisher = |last = Wilson|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-executive directors can also be referred to as external directors; they are usually people of stature and experience who can act as both a source of wise independent advice and a check on any wilder elements on a board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 30 Day MBA, 3rd Edition|last = Colin|first = Barrow|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-7494-6990-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UK [[Institute of Directors]], non-executive directors are expected to focus on board matters and not stray into ‘executive direction,’ thus providing an independent view of the company that is removed from day-to-day running.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Non-executive directors, then, are appointed to bring to the board: 
* Independence;
* Impartiality;
* Wide experience;
* Special knowledge;
* Personal qualities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In addition to the above five key qualities an effective non-executive director would influence the achievement of balance of the board of directors as a whole as well as commitment, perception and a broad perspective of the area or industry. More key responsibilities may include:
* Contributing to the strategic direction of the company;
* Efficiently solving problems that arise;
* Communicating with third parties;
* Ensuring all the audit requirements are satisfied;
* Remuneration of the executive directors;
* Appointing the board of directors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.comsuregroup.com/the-increasing-importance-of-non-executive-directors/|title = The Increasing Importance Of Non-Executive Directors|date = 28 February 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = Comsure Group|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key responsibilities==
Non-executive directors have responsibilities in the following areas, according to the [[Review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors]] (the Higgs report), published by the [[British government]] in 2003:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Strategy:''' Non-executive directors should constructively challenge and contribute to the development of strategy. As an external member of an organisation, the NED may have a clearer or wider view of possible factors affecting the company and its business environment, more-so than executive directors.
* '''Performance:''' Non-executive directors should scrutinise the performance of management in meeting-agreed goals and objectives and monitoring and, where necessary, removing senior management, and in [[succession planning]].
* '''Risk:''' Non-executive directors should satisfy themselves that financial information is accurate and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible.
* '''People:''' Non-executive directors can benefit the company's and board's effectiveness through outside contacts and opinions. Helping the business and board connect with networks of useful people and organisations become an important function for the NED to fulfill.

NEDs should also provide independent views on:
* Resources
* Appointments
* Standards of conduct

Boards (and the non-executive directors on them) also have a responsibility to evaluate their own performance. Reasons for undertaking a board evaluation might include: 

* to address specific issues;
* to benchmark performance against other companies;
* the need to ensure that the board is doing the best it can; and
* the need to be seen to be doing something.

Much has been written about how best to go about evaluating board performance and it remains a key topic of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2017/03/how-boards-should-evaluate-their-own-performance|title=How Boards Should Evaluate Their Own Performance|date=2017-03-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1998/01/appraising-boardroom-performance|title=Appraising Boardroom Performance|date=1998-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nurole.com/news_and_guides/how-to-evaluate-board-performance|title=How do you evaluate board performance?|date=2018-04-18|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icaew.com/technical/corporate-governance/uk-corporate-governance/board-evaluations-and-effectiveness-reviews|title=Board evaluations and effectiveness reviews|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative and positive contributions==
Having a non-executive director in a business may seem necessary due to the benefits having one can provide, however it is possible a NED may contribute to a dynamic of deteriorating board relationships. Executives could come to resent or be frustrated by non-executive contributions that they perceive to be either ill-informed or inappropriate. This in turn can contribute to a dynamic of deteriorating board relationships, characterized by withholding of information and mistrust.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00444.x/full|title = Beyond Agency Conceptions of the Work of the Non-Executive Director: Creating Accountability in the Boardroom|last = Roberts|first = John|date = 8 March 2005|journal = British Journal of Management|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00444.x|pmid = |access-date = 3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one executive described it:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘When a non-executive director displays insight and real knowledge and undertakes a role in a very serious fashion, asks brave questions, takes an interest in issues the directors know that they are going to be kept on their toes in relation to these issues, and the respect level rises. Then that person becomes an approachable person … it is actually cumulative in terms of the benefits that can come from that … it can go completely the other way because it is just, “well, they don't know anything about the business, they had to ask the obligatory three questions” and then the respect gets lost between the parties and you do not have a relationship that is built. It gets back down to what is the ability of the person and what is driving them to become engaged … When that engagement actually adds value and can be seen to add value, then very quickly you get a dynamic where you improve the situation.’&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Audit==
It is the duty of the whole board to ensure that the company accounts properly to its shareholders by presenting a true and fair reflection of its actions and financial performance and that the necessary internal control systems are put into place and monitored regularly and rigorously. A non-executive director has an important part to play in fulfilling this responsibility whether or not a formal audit committee (composed of non-executive directors) of the board has been constituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Director's Handbook|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 2010|isbn = 9780749460587|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
It is vitally important that all Non-executive directors are aware of their duties and liabilities as well as developing the softer skills associated with the role such as board behaviour and effective challenge. There are a number of organisations who provide this type of training such as the Institute of Directors and The Financial Times, who offer a fully accredited Level 7 Diploma for those who wish to embark on a successful portfolio career.

==Types of organisation==
A non-executive director can be appointed in different organisations:
* The Private Sector
* The Public Sector
* Academic Sector
* Third Sector
Duties will depend on whether they represent the interest of shareholders, in the private sector, or the interest of the society in public organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thenonexecrole.nedonboard.com/ |title = What to Expect of the NED Role, NEDonBoard |date = 6 June 2017|accessdate = 3 June 2017 |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appraisal objectives==
Some organisations appraise non-executive directors on general overall performance criteria such as in the Higgs Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbs.com/content/dam/rbs/Documents/about/boards-committees/Terms-and-Conditions-non-executive-directors.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085006/http://www.rbs.com/content/dam/rbs/Documents/about/boards-committees/Terms-and-Conditions-non-executive-directors.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colchesterhospital.nhs.uk/meetings_minutes/supporting_docs/january_2014/16jan14COG%20Agenda%20item%2016%20-%20Chair%20and%20NED%20Appraisals.pdf |format=PDF |title=Council of Governor Meeting: 16 January 2014 |website=Colchesterhospital.nhs.uk |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iod.com/Guidance/briefings/bis-board-and-director-appraisal|title=Resources and factsheets|website=Iod.com|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others in addition set specific individual objectives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.neas.nhs.uk/media/60190/item_9_-_perf_apr_of_neds__obj_13.pdf|title = PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT &amp; APPRAISAL OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 2012/13 AND OBJECTIVES FOR 2013/14|date = 12 April 2013|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = neas|publisher = |last = Winter|first = A J G}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be specifically linked to the overall organisation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabp.nhs.uk/members/about/13%20Process%20for%20NED.pdf |format=PDF |title=Council of Governor Meeting: 2 March 2009 |website=Sabp.nhs.uk |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenProcurement''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] [[procurement software]] toolkit that automates procurement processes. It provides tools to design and build a transparent and competitive procurement process backed by strong data collection, electronic documents, and detailed reporting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openprocurement.io/|title=Development of Open Procurement toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=openprocurement.io|publisher=Official website|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenProcurement toolkit was first released in 2014 under Apache license for free and open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/openprocurement/openprocurement.api|title=openprocurement/openprocurement.api|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally OpenProcurement had been developed by Quintagroup&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quintagroup.com/cms/cases/openprocurement/openprocurement|title=Open Procurement - open source electronic system of public procurement developed using the Python programming language.|last=|first=|date=|website=quintagroup.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Prozorro|ProZorro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.open-contracting.org/2015/06/02/open_contracting_in_ukraine_a_collaborative_effort_for_procurement_reform/|title=Open Contracting in Ukraine: a collaborative effort for procurement reform|date=2015-06-02|website=Open Contracting Partnership|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a procurement system implemented to provide transparent and efficient spending of public funds in Ukraine. But due to toolkit’s flexibility and scalability it remains in use for other government and private sector procurements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Open Contracting ==

The toolkit contains Data Standard for procurement procedures. It was developed on the basis of [[Open Contracting Data Standard|Open Contracting 1.0RC]] http://standard.open-contracting.org and extended to ensure practical implementation of the procurement process in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Use cases and production deployments ==

===  ProZorro ===

OpenProcurement toolkit was designed specifically for the [[Prozorro]], the Ukrainian electronic [[public procurement|Government procurement]] system. Prozorro was designed according to international standards and international best practices. As a model Ukrainian system used the procurement system in Georgia that is recognized as one of the best in the world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00KQ6K.pdf|title=Technical assistance for the e-tender initiative in Kyiv, Ukraine (Phase One)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=USAID - From the American People|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the core of ProZorro project this toolkit:
* covers specific requirements to the accessibility and transparency of procedures.
* enforces (where appropriate) and encourages recognised best practices for public procurements during the whole tendering process.
* uses electronic documents, strict qualification requirements, a transparent system of proposal evaluation and awarding, effective reverse auctions and open access to the procurement data.
* applies time and cost effective reverse auction where suppliers compete to sell goods to the procuring entity at the lowest price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prozorro.gov.ua/en/news/eng-everyone-sees-everything-overhauling-ukraine-s-corrupt-contracting-sector/|title=‘Everyone sees everything’: overhauling Ukraine’s corrupt contracting sector {{!}} Prozorro|website=prozorro.gov.ua|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently for login on ProZorro or for the submission of tender proposal participants do not need the electronic digital signature (EDS).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== ProZorro.Sale ===

OpenProcurement toolkit was used by [[ProZorro.Sale|Prozorro.sale]], a Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) system that organizes sale of the assets belonging to insolvent or liquidated banks. Goal of ProZorro.Sale is a transparent, fast and effective sales of state and communal property, as well as fighting against corruption by the means of equal access to data, public control and increasing number of the potential buyers. The Prozorro.sale’s architecture and main components are the same as those in the original Prozorro project. The main difference is that the ascending auction is used for selling assets for the highest price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ti-ukraine.org/en/news/oficial/6366.html|title=A Preliminary Public Auction in Pro.Zorro Sale Was Successfully Tested {{!}} Transparency International|website=ti-ukraine.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open source components==

OpenProcurement toolkit used a number of other open source projects: [[Python (programming language)|Python]], Pyramid, [[AngularJS]], Bootstrap, [[Flask (web framework)|Flask]], [[CouchDB]], PouchDB.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Oracle announced the Oracle Big Data Appliance on October 3, 2011 at [[Oracle OpenWorld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Oracle Digs in On NoSQL, Hadoop, End-to-End Big Data |work= Integration Developer News |author= Vance McCarthy |date= October 2011 |url= http://www.idevnews.com/stories/4858/Oracle-Digs-in-On-NoSQL-Hadoop-End-to-End-Big-Data |access-date= March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was similar to the [[Oracle Exadata]] Database Machine and  announced with the Oracle Exalytics Business Intelligence Machine.&lt;ref name="OBA"&gt;{{cite web |author= Barb Darrow |title= Oracle BigData Appliance stakes big claim |date= October 3, 2011 |work= Giga Om |url= http://gigaom.com/2011/10/03/oracle-big-data-appliance-stakes-big-claim/ |accessdate= March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original hardware components of the appliance consisted of a full rack configuration with 864GB of main memory and 432 TB of storage. A full rack consists of 18 servers nodes each of which had two 6-core Intel processors, 48 GB memory per node (upgradable to 96 GB or 144 GB), 12 x 2TB disks per node, InfiniBand Networking and 10 GbE connectivity.&lt;ref name="BBOR" /&gt;

== Software ==
The product includes an open-source distribution of [[Apache Hadoop]]. Support from [[Cloudera]] was announced in January 2012.&lt;ref name="CLO"&gt;{{cite web |author= Doug Henschen |title= Oracle Makes Big Data Appliance Move With Cloudera |work= Information Week |date= January 10, 2012 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/info_management/232400021 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120113011538/http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/info_management/232400021 |archivedate= January 13, 2012 |accessdate= March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oracle NoSQL Database]], [[Oracle Data Integrator]] with an adapter for Hadoop Oracle Loader for Hadoop, an open source distribution of [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Oracle Linux]], and [[HotSpot|Oracle Java Hotspot]] Virtual Machine were also mentioned in the announcement..&lt;ref name="BDE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanaracus|first=Chris|title=Oracle Rolls Out 'Big Data' Appliance|url=http://www.cio.com/article/690884/Oracle_Rolls_Out_Big_Data_Appliance?page=1&amp;taxonomyId=3007|publisher=CIO|accessdate=30 December 2011|date=3 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has long seemed to me that there is an unfortunate gulf between the commercial lawyer and the property and equity lawyer.

But in the world of business, problems do not divide themselves into neat packages. ...

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to commercial law:

'''[[Commercial law]]''' &amp;ndash; body of [[law]] that governs [[business]] and [[commerce|commercial]] transactions. It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]]. It is also called '''business law'''.

== What ''type'' of thing is commercial law? ==

Commercial law can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[law]] &amp;ndash; law is a [[system]] of rules and guidelines which are enforced through [[social]] [[institution]]s to govern behavior, wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90; see "[[analytical jurisprudence]]" for extensive debate on what law is; in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules" (Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184); Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction" (Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]); Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] (Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410); and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests (Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize|date=October 2010}}
In [[commercial law]], a '''principal''' is a person, [[Legal person|legal]] or [[Natural person|natural]], who authorizes an [[Agent (law)|agent]] to act to create one or more legal relationships with a [[:wikt:third party|third party]]. This branch of law is called [[Agency (law)|agency]] and relies on the [[common law]] proposition '''''qui facit per alium, facit per se''''' ([[Latin]] "he who acts through another, acts personally").

It is a parallel concept to [[vicarious liability]] and [[strict liability]] (in which one person is held liable for the acts or omissions of another) in [[criminal law]] or [[tort]]s.

==Concepts==
In a busy commercial world, the smooth flow of trade depends on the use of agents. This may be because in [[business entity|business entities]] such as:
*[[sole trader]]s, their ability to conduct business will always be limited unless other people are used to work on their behalf;
*a [[partnership]], the [[natural person]]s who are involved cannot be present to conduct business in multiple locations simultaneously, so they must rely on others to make agreements or deliver services on their behalf; or
*a [[corporation]] is only a [[Juristic person|legal entity]] or fictitious legal person and so can only act through the agency of human beings to get anything done.
In the majority of cases, it is impossible for agents to seek specific authority for every deal or detail within a deal. Agents must, of necessity, be allowed some degree of discretion in the conduct of routine transactions. But, for the purposes of ascribing legal responsibility to the Principal, when the Agent acts with actual or apparent authority, all the Agent's knowledge will be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the Principal. If Principals were allowed to hide behind their agents' own ignorance, mistakes or failures to communicate, a Principal could, by using an Agent, achieve a better result than if they acted personally. For example, if the particular deal turned out well, the Principal could adopt the transaction. But, if it turned out badly, the Principal could disavow it. Indeed, if not for imputation, there would be a [[perverse incentive]] to conduct business through Agents rather than personally. Consequently, the Principal cannot exploit ignorance to their advantage by instructing the Agent to withhold key information or by appointing an Agent known to be secretive.

This rule in favour of imputation relates to the duties an Agent owes a Principal, in particular the Agent's duty to communicate material facts to the Principal. Since the purpose of the law is to offer protection to Third Parties who have acted in [[good faith]], it is reasonable to allow them to believe that, in most cases, the Agents have fulfilled this duty. After all, the Principal selects the Agents and has the power to control their actions both through express instructions and incentives intended to influence their behaviour which will include laying down routines for how Agents should handle information, and the extent to which Agents will be rewarded for transmitting information of commercial value. The result is a form of strict liability in which the legal consequences of an Agent's acts or omissions are attributed to a Principal even when the Principal was without fault in appointing or supervising the Agent. Borrowing parallel concepts from Tort and [[Equity (law)|Equity]], this means that the Principal owes the Third Party a [[duty of care]] to ensure that the Agent is honest and efficient, and that a Principal is [[estoppel|estopped]] from denying that an Agent was authorised to act as they did.


==Summary of law==
There are three classes of Principal:
{| class="wikitable"
|+3 classes of principal
!Class
!Description
|-
|Disclosed
|at the time of the transaction made by the Agent with the Third Party, the latter knows that the person he is dealing with is acting as an Agent and also knows the Principal’s identity.
|-
|Partially disclosed
|at the time of the transaction, the Third Party knows that the person he is dealing with is acting as an Agent but does not know the Principal’s identity.
|-
|Undisclosed
|The person acting as an Agent represents they are acting on their own behalf and does not disclose the existence of the agency relationship. 
|}

===Authority===
For these purposes, the Principal must give, or be deemed to give, the Agent authority to act.
*Actual authority
:This arises where the Principal's words or conduct reasonably cause the Agent to believe they have been authorised to act. This may be expressed as a [[contract]] or implied because what is said or done make it reasonably necessary for the person to assume the powers of an Agent. If it is clear that the Principal gave actual authority to Agent, all the Agent's actions falling within the scope of the authority given bind the Principal. This results even if, having actual authority, the Agent in fact acts [[fraud]]ulently for his own benefit, unless the Third Party was aware of the Agent's personal agenda. If there is no contract but the Principal's words or conduct reasonably led the Third Party to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, or if what the Agent proposes to do is incidental and reasonably necessary to accomplish an actually authorised transaction or a transaction that usually accompanies it, then the Principal is bound.
*Apparent or [[ostensible authority]]
:If the Principal's words or conduct would lead a reasonable person in the Third Party’s position to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, say by appointing the Agent to a position which carries with it agency-like powers, those who know of the appointment are entitled to assume that there is apparent authority to do the things ordinarily entrusted to one occupying such a position. If a Principal creates the impression that an Agent is authorised but there is no actual authority, Third Parties are protected so long as they have acted reasonably. This is sometimes termed "Agency by [[Estoppel]]" or the "Doctrine of Holding Out", where the Principal is stopped from denying the grant of authority if Third Parties have changed their positions to their detriment in reliance on the representations made.
*Authority by virtue of a position held
:For example, [[partnership|partners]] have apparent authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a [[corporation]], all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their declared position have apparent authority to bind the corporation.
Even if the Agent does act without authority, the Principal may ratify the transaction and accept liability on the transactions as negotiated. This may be express or implied from the Principal's behaviour, e.g. if the Agent has purported to act in a number of situations and the Principal has knowingly acquiesced, the failure to notify all concerned of the Agent's lack of authority is an implied ratification to those transactions and an implied grant of authority for future transactions of a similar nature.mithun

===Liability===

====Agent to Principal====
If the Agent has acted without actual authority, but the Principal is nevertheless bound because the Agent had apparent authority, the Agent is liable to indemnify the Principal for any resulting loss or damage.

====Principal to Agent====
If the Agent has acted within the scope of the actual authority given, the Principal must indemnify the Agent for payments made during the course of the relationship whether the expenditure was expressly authorized or merely  necessary in promoting the Principal’s business.

====Third Party to Principal====
The Third Party is liable to the Principal on the terms of the agreement made with the Agent, unless the Principal was undisclosed and there is clear evidence that either the Agent or the Principal knew that the Third Party would not have entered into the agreement if they had known of the Principal's involvement.

===Duties===
The relationship between a Principal and an Agent is [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary]] which requires the Agent to be loyal to the Principal. This involves duties:
*not to accept any new obligations that are inconsistent with the duties owed to the Principal. Agents can represent the interests of more than one Principal, conflicting or potentially conflicting, only on the basis of full and timely disclosure or where the different agencies are based on a limited form of authority to prevent a situation where the Agent's loyalty to the any one of the multiple Principals is compromised. For this purpose, express clauses in the agreement signed by each Principal with the Agent may identify specific types or categories of activities that do not breach the duty of loyalty and so long as these exceptions are not unreasonable, they bind the Principals.
*not to make a private profit or unjustly enrich himself from the agency relationship. Principals usually include a power in their contract with the Agents allowing them to inspect the Agents' accounts if reasonable suspicion of improper behavior emerges.
In return, the Principal must make a full disclosure of all information relevant to the transactions that the Agent is authorized to negotiate and pay the Agent either the [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] or fee as agreed, or a reasonable fee if none were previously agreed on.

===Remedies against agent===
The principal has the following remedies against the agent for breaching his/her [[fiduciary duty]]:&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"&gt;Slide 9 of [http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/student_view0/chapter19/powerpoint_presentations.html Chapter 19 Powerpoint] for text {{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0073524972|edition=2d|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kubasek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2016|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781259415654|edition=3d|page=422|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constructive trust====
If the agent wrongfully holds property that should be owned or entitled to the principal, the principal can ask the court to deem it a [[constructive trust]]—that the agent is holding the property on behalf of the principal.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Avoidance====

The principal can void contracts negotiated by an agent that breached his or her fiduciary duty.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Indemnification====

The principal can sue the agent for liability caused by the agent's wrongful acts, i.e. if a third party obtained a judgment against the principal for wrongful acts caused by the agent, the principal can sue the agent to recover the loss.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Negligence (for not following instructions)====

A principal can sue for the negligence of an agent who '''failed to follow instructions''', unless it was simply a failure to follow the principal's ''advice''.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

===Undisclosed principal===
An '''Undisclosed principal''' is an unrevealed one, in a situation involving an undisclosed [[agency (law)|agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 563 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is "a person who uses an agent for his/her negotiations with a third party, often when the agent pretends to be acting for himself/herself." &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=2188&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[real estate]] transaction, this could be any "major party to a transaction, such as a seller or purchaser of property," who wishes to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realestateagent.com/glossary/real-estate-glossary-show-term-1828-undisclosed-principal.html Real Estate Agent.com web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some taxing authorities have created [[Law|rules]] regarding tax liability for actions of an undisclosed principal.&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois v. Taxpayer, ST 97-12, found at [http://www.revenue.state.il.us/legalinformation/hearings/st/st97-12.pdf State of Illinois government web site].&lt;/ref&gt;  The undisclosed agency may also affect [[tort]] [[Legal liability|liability]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wahab Janitorial Services v. P.M. Group Mgt.'', 161 Ohio App.3d 632, 2007-Ohio-3037 (2005), found at [http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/1/2005/2005-Ohio-3037.pdf Pdf file of ''Wahab Janitorial Services'' case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230191847/http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/1/2005/2005-ohio-3037.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===
The Principal can terminate an Agent's authority at any time without having to give notice. If the trust between the Agent and Principal has broken down, it is not reasonable to allow the Principal to remain at risk in any transactions that the Agent might conclude during a period of notice.

==Economic analysis==
{{main|Principal–agent problem}}

The analysis of principal-agent relationships is an important topic in economics. The main focus of analysis is on the [[information asymmetry]] between the agent, who is assumed to be well informed, and the principal who may not be.

Web. 16 Aug. 2012. &lt;http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Testing-Out-Proposal-Automation-Suites/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposal management software is becoming increasingly popular in companies that manage frequent and extensive proposal writing projects. Such software allows businesses to automate the more routine tasks while easily [[version control|tracking multiple versions]].&lt;ref&gt;Brusaw, Charles T., Gerald J. Alred, and Walter E. Oliu.

Print, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Many software applications integrate with [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] software, content management solutions, accounting platforms, and electronic signature providers. Some integrate with Microsoft Office and Office 365.

Proposal management software is considered to be a sales efficiency tool as it helps maximize every cross-sell and upsell opportunity by spending less time on creating and management sales documents and delivering timely and relevant information, when it's appropriate in the sales cycle of an opportunity. This means brand-compliant materials with the latest information on new products, on demand, based on the unique selling situation. In some cases, it’s argued that this software solution bleeds into an up-and-coming “sales enablement” software genre. However, proposal management software addresses inefficiencies and lack of visibility in the sales cycle, rather than “sales enablement” efforts  defined as sales coaching and guiding the sale.

==Main features==

The core features of proposal management software vary widely between systems. Many simpler programs have only basic features, while others, especially [[Business|enterprise]] systems, are more complex and powerful. Proposal management software is a set of automated processes that may support the following features.&lt;ref&gt;Sant, Tom. Persuasive Business Proposals: Writing to Win More Customers, Clients, and Contracts. New York: AMACOM, 2004. Print., pg. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Allow for a large number of people to share and contribute to both stored proposal templates and data;
* Control access to proposals based on defined user roles (i.e., define information that users or user groups can view, edit, publish, etc.);
* Provides multi-tier approval;
* Facilitates storage and retrieval of proposals;
* Control over [[data validation|data validity]];
* Simplify proposal writing;
* Improve communication and collaboration among users;
* Management of specific sections of a document;
* Increased content and brand compliance;
* Decrease in time to final assembly;
* Track the time spent by various contributors, enabling management to calculate ROI of each document;
* Provides the ability to electronically sign contracts, tax documents, and legal materials that are included in the proposal &lt;ref&gt;Lester, Amanda.

==Data types and usage==
Proposal software is frequently used for storing, controlling, revising, [[semantic publishing|semantically enriching]], and publishing documentation. Serving as a central repository, the proposal software increases the version level of new updates to an already existing file.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Amanda. "What Is Proposal Management Software" GetTinderBox.com. TinderBox, 7 Aug. 2013. Web. &lt;http://gettinderbox.com/what-is-proposal-management-software/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard requirement for salespeople is to have a standard proposal that you can modify to meet the specific requirements of your customer or prospect. Simple cutting and pasting of boilerplate materials can make it easy to create good proposals.&lt;ref&gt;London, Jonathan; Lucas, Martin (2012-08-15). Using Technology to Sell: Tactics to Ratchet Up Results (Kindle Locations 3451-3454). Apress. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The software enables users to assemble individual components into a document structure.  Some solutions offer uses a 'shopping cart' experience, where salespeople are able to select which content components to include in the final document.These components are then reused (rather than copied and pasted) within a document or across multiple documents. Data tags and smart content sections allow for automatic tailoring by client name, region or product selection. This ensures that content is consistent across the entire document set.&lt;ref&gt;"Crash Course for Content Management: What is content management?". Vasont Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Web-Based Proposal Management Software==
SaaS or Web-based proposal management software require content to be imported into the system. However, once content is imported, the software acts like a search engine so users can find what they are looking for faster. The html format allows for better application of search capabilities such as full-text searching and stemming.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Amanda.

[[File:Purchasing Managers Index.png|thumb|ISM's Purchasing Managers Index 1948–2012]]

'''Purchasing Managers' Indexes''' ('''PMI''') are [[economic indicators]] derived from monthly surveys of private sector companies.

The three principal producers of PMIs are the [[Institute for Supply Management]] (ISM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/news/content.cfm?ItemNumber=28965&amp;navItemNumber=28882|title=ISM Report On Business|author=ISM|date=|website=instituteforsupplymanagement.org|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which originated the manufacturing and non-manufacturing metrics and which produces them for the United States, the [[Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management]] ([[SIPMM]]), which produces the Singapore PMI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturing expands for 18th straight month in February but pace of growth slows|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-manufacturing-grows-for-16th-straight-month-in-december-but-pace-shows|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=新加坡2月份PMI下滑0.4点至52.7|url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/zfinance/realtime/story20180302-839450|publisher=联合早报|accessdate=2 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore PMI |url=https://sipmm.edu.sg/about-sipmm-academy/singapore-pmi/|publisher=SIPMM Academy|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore PMI expands 0.3 point to 53 in March |url=http://sbr.com.sg/manufacturing/news/singapore-pmi-expands-03-point-53-in-march|publisher=Singapore Business Review|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Markit Group]], which produces metrics based on ISM's work for over 30 countries worldwide.

ISM, SIPMM, and Markit Group separately compile Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) surveys on a monthly basis by polling businesses which represent the makeup of the respective business sector. ISM's surveys cover all [[NAICS]] categories. SIPMM survey covers all manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore manufacturing shows strong signs of broad-based growth|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/manufacturing-shows-strong-signs-of-broad-based-growth|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SIPMM|url=https://sipmm.org.sg/about/|publisher=Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Real Estate (Singapore)|url=https://www.dbs.com/aics/templatedata/article/industry/data/en/GR/072016/Singapore_Real_Estate_Industrial.xml|publisher=DBS Bank|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Markit survey covers private sector companies, but not the public sector.

ISM began to produce the report for the United States in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm|title=Manufacturing - Report On Business|author=ISM|date=|website=www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveys are released shortly after the end of the reference period. The actual release dates depend on the sector covered by the survey. Manufacturing data are generally released on the first business day of the month, followed by construction (Markit only) on the second working day, and non-manufacturing/services on the third business day. SIPMM produces the monthly bulletin since 1998 for the Singapore manufacturing sectors, with a focus on the electronics manufacturing sector since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key gauge of economic health due for a checkup|url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BBusiness%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20080419-60706.html|publisher=The Business Times|accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data are released on the second business day of each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower rate in April|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-manufacturing-sector-expands-for-17th-straight-month-9922130|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=3 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's manufacturing PMI falls to 52.7 in February|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/02/c_137011888.htm|publisher=Xinhua News|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago-PMI survey, owned by Deutsche Börse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20110627/NEWS01/110629885/chicago-pmi-parent-finds-buyer-in-deutsche-b%C3%B6rse|title=Chicago PMI parent finds buyer in Deutsche Börse|author=|date=|website=chicagobusiness.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; registers manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity in the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago Region]]. Investors value this indicator because the Chicago region somewhat mirrors the United States overall in its distribution of manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity. {{cn|date=October 2015}}

The predominant operator and owner of Purchasing Managers Index series outside the USA is the [[Markit Group]].&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt; Markit issue most of their PMIs in partnership with other companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/Page.mvc/PressReleases IHS Markit Press releases]&lt;/ref&gt; SIPMM is the official Purchasing Managers Index series in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower rate in April|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-s-manufacturing-activity-expanded-at-a-slower-rate-in-8811278|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore manufacturing PMI inches up to 50.9 in June|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-manufacturing-pmi-inches-up-to-509-in-june|publisher=The Business Times|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, SIPMM assisted China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) to produce the China Official PMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School that created S’pore’s PMI looking to expand reach overseas|url=http://www.todayonline.com/business/school-created-spores-pmi-looking-expand-reach-overseas|publisher=TODAY|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISM, SIPMM and Markit Purchasing Managers Indices include additional sub indices for manufacturing surveys such as new orders, employment, exports, stocks of raw materials and finished goods, prices of inputs and finished goods.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.markit.com/product/PMI|title=PMI|author=|date=|website=www.markit.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula, calculation, and reading==
PMI data are presented in the form of a [[diffusion index]], which is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; PMI = (P_1*1) + (P_2*0.5) + (P_3*0) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Percentage number of answers that reported an improvement.
*P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Percentage number of answers that reported no change.
*P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = Percentage number of answers that reported a deterioration.
 
Thus, if 100% of the panel reported an improvement, the index would be 100.0. If 100% reported a deterioration, the index would be zero.  If 100% of the panel saw no change, the index would be 50.0 (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; * 0.5).

Therefore, an index reading of 50.0 means that the variable is unchanged, a number over 50.0 indicates an improvement, while anything below 50.0 suggests a decline. An index of 50.0 would arise if either all respondents reported no change or the number of respondents reporting an improvement was matched by the number of respondents reporting a deterioration. The further away from 50.0 the index is, the stronger the change over the month, e.g. a reading of 55.0 points to a more frequently reported increase in a variable than a reading of 52.5.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt; The degree of confidence experienced by respondents reporting an improvement and the degree of concern experienced by respondents reporting a deterioration are not factored into the index.

==Headline Manufacturing PMI==
The headline manufacturing PMI is a composite of five of the survey indices. These are New orders, Output, Employment, Suppliers' delivery times (inverted) and Stocks of purchases. The ISM attributes each of these variables the same weighting when calculating the overall PMI, whereas Markit uses the following weights: New orders (0.3), Output (0.25), Employment (0.2), Suppliers' Delivery Times (0.15), Stocks of purchases (0.1).&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

==Markit Economics' PMI surveys==

The data for the index are collected through a survey of 400 purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector on five different fields, namely, new orders from customers, speed of supplier deliveries, inventories, order backlogs and employment level. Respondents can report either better, same or worse conditions than previous months. For all these fields the percentage of respondents that reported better conditions than the previous months is calculated. The five percentages are multiplied by a weighing factor (the factors adding to 1) and are added.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

===Survey Panels===
[[Purchasing manager]]s form a near ideal survey sample base, having access to information often denied to many other managers. Due to the nature of their job function, it is important that purchasing managers are among the first to know when trading conditions, and therefore company performance, change for the better or worse. Markit therefore uses such executives to produce data on business conditions.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

In each country, a panel of purchasing managers is carefully selected by Markit, designed to accurately represent the true structure of the chosen sector of the economy as determined by official data. Generally, value added data are used at two-digit SIC level, with a further breakdown by company size analysis where possible. The survey panels therefore replicate  the actual economy in miniature. A weighting system is also incorporated into the survey database that weights each response by company size and the relative importance of the sector in which that company operates.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Particular effort is made to achieve monthly survey response rates of around 80%, ensuring that an accurate picture of business conditions is recorded over time.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Data are collected in the second half of each month via mail, email, web, fax and phone.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

===Questionnaires===
A key feature of the PMI surveys is that they ask only for factual information. They are not surveys of opinions, intentions or expectations and the data therefore represent the closest one can get to “hard data” without asking for actual figures from companies.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Questions asked relate to key variables such as output, new orders, prices and employment. Questions take the form of up/down/same replies. For example, “Is your company’s output higher, the same or lower than one month ago?”&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Respondents are asked to take expected seasonal influences into account when considering their replies.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;
 
For each main survey question, respondents are asked to provide a reason for any change on the previous month, if known. This assists not only the understanding of variable movement but also in the seasonal process when X12 cannot be used.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

===Seasonal adjustment===
The seasonal adjustment of PMI survey data is usually calculated using the [[X-12-ARIMA|X12]] statistical programme of adjustment, as used by governmental statistical bodies in many developed countries. However, the X12 programme only produces satisfactory data if five years' historical data are available. In the absence of such a history of data, the PMI survey data are seasonally adjusted using an alternative method (see next paragraph), developed by Markit Economics.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;
 
This method was initially designed to provide analysts with a guide to the underlying trend in the survey data and should be recognized as a second-best approach to X12. However, past experience in other countries suggests that Markit’s method of seasonal adjustment goes beyond this initial purpose and in fact in many cases outperforms X12 as a guide to comparable official data.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Markit's method involves using reasons cited by responding survey panel member companies for changes in variables, which are then used to ascertain whether a reported increase or decrease in each variable reflects an underlying change in economic conditions or simply a seasonal variation. Seasonal variations may include changes in demand arising from Christmas, Easter or other public holidays. Normal, expected changes in weather are not included. The net balance of companies reporting an improvement in a variable less those reporting a deterioration is then adjusted to allow for the percentages of companies reporting seasonal induced increases or decreases in the variable.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9761">A '''relational contract''' is a [[contract]] whose effect is based upon a relationship of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] between the parties to which it pertains.  The explicit terms of the contract are just an outline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the behaviour of the parties.

Relational contract theory was originally developed in the United States by the legal scholars [[Ian Roderick Macneil]] and [[Stewart Macaulay]].  According to Macneil it offered a response to the so-called “[[Death of Contract]]” school’s nihilistic argument that contract was not a fit subject for study as a whole; each different type of contract (e.g., sales, employment, negotiable instruments) could be studied individually, but not “contracts-in-gross”.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “Whither Contracts?” (1969) 21 ''Journal of Legal Education'' 403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc712f1a-3134-11df-8e6f-00144feabdc0.html |publisher=Financial Times |title=Think before you tear up an unwritten contract |author=John Kay |date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macneil explains that this is only one of a number of possible relational theories of contracts, and accordingly renamed his own version “essential contract theory”.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “Contracting Worlds and Essential Contract Theory” (2000) ''[[Social &amp; Legal Studies]]'' 9, 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relational contract theory is characterized by a view of contracts as relations rather than as discrete transactions (which, Macneil argued,&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “The Many Futures of Contract” (1974) 47 ''Southern California Law Review'' 691&lt;/ref&gt; traditional “classical” or "[[neo-classical contract]]" theory treats contracts as being). Thus, even a simple transaction can properly be understood as involving a wider social and economic context. For instance, if A purchases a packet of cigarettes from a shop he has never been into before and will never enter again, that seems quite discrete. However, A will almost certainly have a loyalty to a particular brand of cigarettes and expectations about quality about which he would be prepared to complain to the manufacturer, although he has no contractual privity with the manufacturer. There is also an understanding that A will pay for the cigarettes, not simply run off with them, and that if he tenders a £10 note in exchange for the cigarettes which are priced at £6, the paper money will be acceptable and change of £4 will be given. None of this is explicitly stated between the parties, whose conversation is likely limited to “20 Marlboro, please” on A’s part and “That’ll be £6, please” on the part of the retailer. Thus, even the simplest transaction has a good deal that is unstated and dependent on a wider web of social and economic relations. How far outwards into that web one needs to investigate will depend on the transaction and on the purpose for which it is being examined.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “Reflections on Relational Contract Theory After a Neoclassical Seminar” in H. Collins, D. Campbell and J. Wightman (Eds), ''The Implicit Dimensions of Contract'' (Hart: Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although earlier writing&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “The Many Futures of Contract” (1974) 47 ''Southern California Law Review'' 691; I.R. Macneil, “Contracts: Adjustment of Long-Term Economic Relations Under Classical, Neoclassical and Relational Contract Law” (1978) 72 ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 340.&lt;/ref&gt;  may be taken in places to suggest that the substantive rules of contract law need to be reframed to acknowledge the relational, non-discrete nature of contracts, this has not been subsequently pursued and current scholars have argued that it is neither possible nor necessary to reform the law of contract itself to work effectively with relationally-constituted contracts.&lt;ref&gt;See, M. Eisenberg, “Why There is No Law of Relational Contracts” (2000) 94 ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 805; R. Austen-Baker, “A Relational Law of Contract?” (2004) 20 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other characteristics of relational contract theory are that “contract” is understood to cover economic exchange in general, not just contracts that would be recognized as legally enforceable agreements by courts in any given jurisdiction, that relations are mostly held together by their own internal values and wider social/economic factors, and, at least in relational theory in the Macneil mould, that exchange relations are governed by a number of norms. This last is not to say that relational contract theory is normative in nature, setting out what ought to be the case properly, but rather that there are actual observable normal characteristics or factors at play in relations. Macneil’s essential contract theory offers some 14 norms.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia article [[Ian Roderick Macneil]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has more recently proposed an alternative version of relational contract theory, called “comprehensive contract theory”, which posits four “comprehensive contract norms” in place of Macneil’s 14, though Austen-Baker does not deny the validity of Macneil’s norms as a complex tool of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker, “Comprehensive Contract Theory: A Four-Norm Model of Contract Relations” (2009) 25 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Japanese scholar Takashi Uchida has proposed a version of relational contract theory inspired by Macneil, relating it to the Japanese situation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,  T. Uchida, “The New Development of Contract Law and General Clauses – A Japanese Perspective” in The Organizing Committee (Eds), ''Proceedings of the Symposium: Japanese and Dutch Laws Compared'' (University of Tokyo Centre for Comparative Law and Politics Institute of Comparative Law: Tokyo, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable contributions to relational contract theory have been made by Stewart Macaulay (U.S.), Lisa Bernstein (U.S.), [[David Campbell (legal academic)|David Campbell]] (England) and John Wightman (England).

Recent research from the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management, the [[University of Tennessee]] and [http://www.lindahl.se/en/home/ Lindahl law firm] takes the relational contracting theories expressed by Macneil, Macaulay and others and makes them relevant for contracting practitioners trying to craft strategic, collaborative relationships with their procurement and outsourced business partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Unpacking Relational Contracts: The Practitioner's Go-To Guide for Understanding Relational Contracts"[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/] 2016|Vested Way|accessed 26 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
The white paper, &lt;ref&gt;“Unpacking Relational Contracting”&lt;/ref&gt; outlines basic tenets that are foundational to relational contracting, including: communication, risk allocation, problem solving, no-blame culture, joint working, gain and pain sharing, mutual objectives, performance measurement and continuous improvement.
The Unpacking Relational Contracting white paper also describes a five-step process for developing a relational contract:
# Focus on the relationship, not the deal. This step is designed to help build the trust necessary to focus on the relationship. It includes ensuring alignment within the organization and using a process for choosing a partner that considers relational competencies in addition to service offerings, quality levels, etc.
# Establish a Partnership instead of Arms-Length Relationship. This step is designed to explore and lay the foundation of trust, transparency and compatibility between the parties.
# Embed Social Norms in the Relationship. This step is designed helps the parties jointly discover and formally agree to six guiding principles: reciprocity, autonomy, honesty, loyalty, equity, integrity.  
# Avoid and Mitigate Risks by Alignment of Interests. This step lays the foundation for continuously aligning interests, beginning agreement on a shared vision and strategic objectives for the partnership, specifying what joint success and value looks like. 
# Create a Fair and Flexible Framework. Establish a governance framework for continuous relationship management. The parties agree upon the contract clauses that are necessary to establish the more specific rules of the relationship, all of them aligned with the guiding principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Remote service software''' is used by equipment manufacturers to remotely monitor, access and repair products in use at customer sites. It’s a secure, auditable gateway for service teams to troubleshoot problems, perform proactive maintenance, assist with user operations and monitor performance.  This technology is typically implemented in mission-critical environments like hospitals or IT data centers – where equipment downtime is intolerable.

==Benefits==
Remote service software helps to:
* Increase uptime, improve performance and extend the life of a device
* Control service costs by deploying patches and upgrades remotely, and ensure a first-time fix when an onsite visit is required
* Streamline administration of pay-per-use models, with automated usage monitoring
* Focus highly trained service teams on preventative maintenance, by diagnosing and repairing issues before they cause system failure
* Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty

Manufacturers are using aftermarket service a competitive differentiator.  Remote service software provides a platform for manufacturers to offer and meet stringent [[service level agreement]]s (SLAs) without increasing the size of their service team.

== Key characteristics of remote service software==
* '''Proactive:''' Remote monitoring of devices in use allows service teams to detect potential issues before they escalate, degrade performance or cause a system failure. This early warning system is a key component to issue avoidance and ability to meet more stringent [[key performance indicators|key performance indicator]] (KPIs) in SLAs. Once an issue is detected, service professionals can also use remote service technology gateways to push patches or resolve issues.
* '''Secure:''' Secure access is a core consideration of remote service.  Solutions should adhere to compliance guidelines and protect the remote connection between the manufacturer and the customer – ensuring that no data has been stolen and no outsiders have been granted access.
* '''Auditable:''' [ [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[PCI DSS|PCI]] ] compliance regulations require businesses to keep track of who does what on their network.  Auditors require forensic logs to trace the steps of every interaction a remote service technician has with every device.

== Other names for remote service software==
* [[Intelligent device management|IDM: intelligent device management]]
* SSM: strategic service management
* RDM: remote device management

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3466">'''Rules of origin''' are used to determine the [[country of origin]] of a product for purposes of [[international trade]].  There are two common types of rules of origin depending upon application, the preferential and non-preferential rules of origin (19 CFR 102).   The exact rules vary from country to country, from agreement to agreement.

== Non-preferential ==
Non-preferential rules of origin are used to determine the country of origin for certain purposes.
These purposes ''may'' be for quotas, anti-dumping, anti-circumvention, statistics or origin labelling.

The basis for the non-preferential rules originates from the Kyoto convention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trade/kyoto/ky-d1-e0.htm|title=Trade Programme – Trade – UNECE|website=www.unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if a product is wholly obtained or produced completely within one country the product shall be deemed having origin in that country. For a product which has been produced in more than one country the product shall be determined to have origin in the country where the '''last substantial transformation''' took place.

To determine exactly what was the last substantial transformation, three general rules are applied:
# Change of tariff classification (on any level, though 4-digit level is the most common)
# Value added-rule ([[ad valorem]])
# Special processing rule, the minimum transformation is described. For instance, in the EU non-preferential rules of origin for T-shirts (HS6109), the origin is supposed to be in the country where the ''complete making-up'' was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?direct=yes&amp;lang=en&amp;consleg=01993R2454|title=EUR-Lex – Simple search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the non-preferential rules a product always has exactly one country of origin.  However, the non-preferential rules may differ from country to country; the same product may have different origins depending on which country's scheme is applied. Usually it is the rules of the country into which a product is being imported that apply.

== Preferential ==
Preferential RoO are part of a [[free trade area]] or preferential trade arrangement which includes tariff concessions. These trade arrangements might be unilateral, bilateral or regional (also sometimes called multilateral) trade arrangements. The rules of origin determine what products can benefit from the tariff concession or preference, in order to avoid [[transshipment]].

'''Semantic Intelligence''' is the ability to gather the necessary information to allow to identify, detect and solve [[semantic gap]]s on all level of the organization.

Similar to [[Operational Intelligence]] or [[Operational Intelligence|Business Process Intelligence]], which aims to identify, detect and then optimize business processes, semantic intelligence targets information instead of processes. It aims to enable better understanding and insight in data by all stakeholders. This will support better information sharing, reuse and governance and support better business decision-making.

== Semantic Gap ==

Several types of semantic gaps can be identified:
# The semantic gap between different data sources - structured or unstructured
# The semantic gap between the operational data and the human interpretation of this data
# The semantic gap between people communicating about a certain information concept.

One application of semantic intelligence is the management of [[unstructured information]], leveraging [[semantic technology]]. These applications tackle R&amp;D, sales, marketing and security for activities that include [[Knowledge Management]], [[Customer Care]] and [[Corporate Intelligence]].

Several applications aim to detect and solve different types of semantic gaps. They range from [[search engine]]s to automatic categorizers, from [[ETL system]]s to [[natural language]] interfaces, special functionality include [[dashboard]]s and [[text mining]].

One approach that aims to provide a holistic solution to achieve semantic intelligence is [[Business semantics management]]. Instead of focusing on very specific type of semantic gap (i.e. unstructured data), it aims to provide a whole solution to align business and it to share the understanding and semantics of information concepts.

== History ==

In 2002, the software company [[Expert System S.p.A.]] started to popularize Semantic Intelligence as a term to describe a new generation of information access technology applications based on semantic analysis. In opposition to standard systems to process unstructured information (such as keyword based systems), semantic intelligence applications focus on the meaning of the texts.

In 2008, the software company [[Collibra]] started commercializing years of academic research on semantic technology. It has positioned its [[Business semantics management]] approach as a way to achieve Semantic Intelligence.

[[File:Stakeholder (en).svg|thumb|Internal and external stakeholders]]
In management, a '''stakeholder approach''' suggests that managers should formulate and implement processes which satisfy [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' needs in order to ensure the long-term success of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=James E.|last2=Preston|first2=Lee E.|last3=Sachs|first3=Sybille|date=2002-10-01|title=Managing the Extended Enterprise: The New Stakeholder View|url=http://cmr.ucpress.edu/content/45/1/6|journal=California Management Review|volume=45|issue=1|pages=6–28|doi=10.2307/41166151|issn=0008-1256}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the degree of participation of the different groups, the company can take advantage of market imperfections in order to create valuable opportunities. It emphasizes active management of the business environment, relationships and the promotion of shared interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|last2=McVea|first2=John|date=2001-01-01|title=A Stakeholder Approach to Strategic Management|ssrn=263511}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is based on the [[stakeholder theory]] which arises as a counterpart to the dominant way of understanding business and management that is focused on shareholders satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=xF8-WN1QlIMC|title=Stakeholder Theory: The State of the Art|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|last2=Harrison|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Wicks|first3=Andrew C.|last4=Parmar|first4=Bidhan L.|last5=Colle|first5=Simone de|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139484114|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this approach can reinforce the firm values and create competitive advantage. However, it has been criticized for overvaluing stakeholders and its difficulty to reach consensus. [[File:Stakeholder management process.png|thumb|Stakeholder management process]]

== Utility ==
=== Competitive advantage ===
This approach is more able to create competitive advantage because it creates a link between the firm and stakeholders. The latter will perceive the coherent application of the organizational values and will relate those values with his own. In that way, the company will have the needed information about stakeholders in order to treat them well and develop important initiatives. By doing that, the firm’s reputation and loyalty will be reinforced among customers and other stakeholders alike, it will create stronger [[brand recognition]] and will increase trust in the firm.  Even if there are limits in loyalty and reputation can be damaged, those two key elements can make a big difference creating barriers to other companies that may want to have information about stakeholder utility functions. A firm that follows the stakeholder approach will get the information needed to work for satisfying the stakeholders’ needs, making it easier to develop expertise. Those acquired skills can be transmitted, promoted and reinforced across the [[Business operations|business operation]] of the firm creating [[Core competency|core competencies]]. Over time, this approach can become an indispensable issue in the organizational culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maignan|first=Isabelle|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Tracy|last3=Hult|first3=Tomas|last4=Ferrell|first4=O.C.|date=25 July 2011|title=Stakeholder orientation: development and testing of a framework for socially responsible marketing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232971635_Stakeholder_orientation_Development_and_testing_of_a_framework_for_socially_responsible_marketing|journal=Journal of Strategic Marketing|volume=19|pages=313–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Value creating through innovation ===
Firms that manage for stakeholders are more able to attract a higher-quality workforce. Employees’ job satisfaction has an impact on the firm’s ability to foster innovation. Workers who are satisfied with their jobs are more likely to engage in long-term thinking and generate potentially valuable ideas. Those firms can use information about stakeholder to devise new ways of satisfying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flammer|first=Caroline|last2=Kacperczyk|first2=Aleksandra|date=2014-08-19|title=The Impact of Stakeholder Orientation on Innovation: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|ssrn=2353076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity is a key aspect in this approach: when stakeholders stand to benefit, they are more likely to reveal information about their utility function. That is why firms and firm managers can better meet consumers' needs by understanding their own customers and suppliers and using this information strategically and flexibly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Bosse|first2=Douglas A.|last3=Phillips|first3=Robert A.|date=2010-01-01|title=Managing for Stakeholders, Stakeholder Utility Functions, and Competitive Advantage|jstor=27735509|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=31|issue=1|pages=58–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divergent interests ===
The implication of all the stakeholders may produce divergent views making it difficult to reach consensus.&lt;ref name="O’Haire"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62575/|title=Strengths and Limitations of Stakeholder Engagement Methods|last=O’Haire|first=Christen|last2=McPheeters|first2=Melissa|last3=Nakamoto|first3=Erika|last4=LaBrant|first4=Lia|last5=Most|first5=Carole|last6=Lee|first6=Kathy|last7=Graham|first7=Elaine|last8=Cottrell|first8=Erika|last9=Guise|first9=Jeanne-Marie|date=2011-06-01|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each stakeholder may care mostly about its own benefits or self-interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265225773_The_Risks_of_Relying_on_Stakeholder_Engagement_for_the_Achievement_of_Sustainability|title=The Risks of Relying on Stakeholder Engagement for the Achievement of Sustainability (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to satisfy a large number of players will complicate governance.{{cn|date=August 2017}} It can result in time consuming in engaging all the parties. Moreover, in this approach, an equality of stakeholders and business is implied in negotiating issues of mutual interest. That assumption has been critiqued in terms of an inequality of resources, negotiating power and time required. The identification of prices and opportunity costs for the different stakeholders difficult and reduce the operability of this approach.&lt;ref name="O’Haire"/&gt;

=== Overvaluing stakeholders ===
It has been suggested that obtaining information about stakeholders' utility functions may produce costs that can exceed the benefits. Therefore, in its intention to create value, managing for stakeholders can end up allocating too many resources to stakeholders. Also, having into account that the power among stakeholders is not equal, some powerful actors can get much of the firm’s profitability. And with that distribution of value, shareholders cannot expect a maximization of returns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In law, a '''voidable floating charge''' refers to a [[floating charge]] entered into shortly prior to the [[company (law)|company]] going into [[liquidation]] which is [[void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]] in whole or in part under applicable insolvency legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and section 267 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, a floating charge is only potentially vulnerable if it is entered into within the vulnerability period under applicable law. The vulnerability period is a period prescribed by statute immediately preceding the company going into liquidation. Most jurisdictions provide for alternative vulnerability periods: a longer one for parties who are "connected" to the company, and a shorter one for unrelated third parties.&lt;ref&gt; Under English law, a floating charge in favour of an unconnected third party is only vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 12 months, but a floating charge in favour of a connected person is vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 2 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of laws relating to voidable floating charges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries simply provide that such charge are automatically void or not enforceable,&lt;ref&gt;Under English law they are stated to be "invalid", which is taken to mean unenforceable.&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions, they are only [[voidable]] and an application must be made by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or creditor for the floating charge to be set aside.

In most jurisdictions, a floating charge is only vulnerable to the extent that it does not secure new money for the company.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; So if a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an "all-monies" floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a [[security interest]] which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the [[unsecured creditor]]s. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.

Most legislation relating to voidable floating charges is also expressed to apply to charges which, as created, were floating charges but which subsequently crystallised into fixed charges.
