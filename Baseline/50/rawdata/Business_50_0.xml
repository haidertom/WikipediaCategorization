==History==
[[File:adbusters talkingrainforest.jpg|thumb|Adbusters' first uncommercial]]

Adbusters was founded in 1989 by [[Kalle Lasn]] and Bill Schmalz, a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.

In 1988, the ''British Columbia Council of Forest Industries,'' the "voice" of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a [[television ad]] campaign called "Forests Forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAzlAu3sK3A |title=Forests Forever Ad (1988) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early example of [[greenwashing]]: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.

Lasn and Shmalz, outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda,  responded by producing the "Talking Rainforest"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49mUeTWGWBE |title=Adbusters - Talking Forest |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that "a tree farm is not a forest." But the duo proved to be unable to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} According to a former Adbusters employee, "The CBC's reaction to the proposed television commercial created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz's commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered 'advocacy advertising' and was disallowed, even though the 'informational' messages that glorified clearcutting were OK."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010222222933/http://www.evolutionzone.com/kulturezone/futurec/culture.jammers.manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation was born out of their belief that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation's key campaigns continues to be the Media Carta,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817064152/http://adbusters.org/campaigns/mediacarta/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; a "movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."

The foundation notes that concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public's access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.

==Mental environmentalism==
The subtitle of ''Adbusters'' magazine is "The Journal of the Mental Environment."

In a 1996 interview, [[Kalle Lasn]] explained the foundation's goal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What we're trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We're motivated by a kind of 'greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.

You can't recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |date=30 April 1996 |title=Cultural Jammin' |url=http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |journal=[[E - The Environmental Magazine]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235938/http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Issues==

===Anti-advertising===
Adbusters describes itself as anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating and maintaining consumer culture. This argument is based on the belief that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities.  Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly "colonized" public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Adbusters's stated goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask "Are we consumers and citizens?"&lt;ref&gt;[Marnie W. Curry-Tash, "The Politics of Teleliteracy and Adbusting in the Classroom", ''English Journal'' 87(1), 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Adbusters'' concludes that advertising conditions people to look to external sources, to define their own personal identities, the magazine advocates a "natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society".&lt;ref&gt;[ Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol.19(2), February 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist feelings. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine attempts to create a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/gcp/pdf/culturejamsandmemewarfare.pdf |title="Culture Jams and Meme Warfare: Kalle Lasn, Adbusters, and media activism", Wendi Pickerel, Helena Jorgensen, and Lance Bennett, 19 April 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and ‘art as protest', often incorporating humor.  This includes  billboard modifications, [[google bombing]], [[flash mobs]] and fake parking tickets for [[SUVs]].  A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods' smile into the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods' persona as a product.  Adbusters calls it "trickle up" activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 "Graphic Anarchy" issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer [[Ernst Bettler]] as "one of the greatest design interventions on record", unaware that Bettler's story was an elaborate [[hoax]].

===Media Carta===
"Media Carta" is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to "make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain."&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt;  Over 30,000 people have signed the document {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} voicing their desire to reclaim the public space.
On 13 September 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including [[CanWest Global Communications|CanWest Global]], [[Bell Globemedia]], [[CHUM Limited|CHUM Ltd.]], and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the television commercial spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials, fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violate business principles by "contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages".&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt; The lawsuit claims that Adbusters' [[freedom of expression]] was unjustly limited by the refusals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html |publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Adbusters Takes Canadian TV Networks to Court |date=15 September 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206041611/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html |archivedate=6 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard.  Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Adbusters-Media-Foundation-971292.html "Adbusters Wins Legal Victory in Ongoing Case Against the CBC and CanWest", Marketwire.com, 6 April 2009] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the [[Advertising|advertisements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satyamag.com/may05/lasn.html |title=Satya May 2005: Interview with Kalle Lasn of Adbusters |publisher=Satyamag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation's commercials to run.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Legal action===
On 3 April 2009, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] unanimously overturned a [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|BC Supreme Court]] ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008.  The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad "Autosaurus". The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  [[Kalle Lasn]] declared the ruling a success and said, "After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Fiona (6 April 2009).  [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090406.wads0406/BNStory/National/home, Fiona Morrow, "Adbusters Wins Right To Sue Broadcasters over TV Ads"] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Detox Week===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Adbusters DigitalDetox.jpg|thumb|250px|Campaign logo for Digital Detox Week {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 4 January 2013}}]] --&gt;
In April 2009, the foundation transformed [[TV Turnoff Week]] into [[Digital Detox Week]], encouraging citizens to spend seven days "unplugged" without any of electronic devices such as video-game systems and computers.

===One Flag===
The "One Flag" competition encouraged readers to create a flag that symbolized "[[global citizenship]]", without using language or commonly known symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters |title=#118 - Adbusters &amp;#124; Journal of the mental environment |publisher=Adbusters |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2017-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031172500/http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters |archive-date=31 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
===Culture jamming===
[[File:American Corporate Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;!-- vector version of the --&gt;American Corporate Flag]]
[[Culture jamming]] is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Lasn, Kalle (2000). Culture Jam, New York: Quill.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was described by [[Joseph Heath]] and Andrew Potter in their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' as "the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement."&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;[[Joseph Heath|Heath, Joseph]] and Potter, Andrew. ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''. Harper Perennial, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the [[Situationist International]] and the tactic of ''[[détournement]]''. The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Adbusters believe large corporations control mainstream media and the flow of information, and culture jamming aims to challenge this as a form of protest. The term "jam" contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine.&lt;ref name="1 April 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410234323/http://cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787 |archivedate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As already noted, the foundation's  approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the [[situationists]] and in particular their concept of ''détournement''. This involves the "turning around" of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates "a limitless artificiality", blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  In the "culture jamming" context, ''détournement'' means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the "dominant discourse" of "late capitalism" is communicated and changing them&amp;nbsp;– frequently in significant but minor ways&amp;nbsp;– to subvert the "monologue of the ruling order" [Debord].

The foundation's activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will "reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mar.10006 |title=Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of ''Adbusters'' |year=2002 | author = Rumbo, Joseph D. |journal=Psychology and Marketing |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=127–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation is particularly well known for its [[culture jamming]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Willan, Claude |title=We're All Borf in the End |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072202231_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |date= 24 July 2005 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the magazine often features photographs of politically motivated [[billboard]] or advertisement [[vandalism]] sent in by readers. The campaigns attempt to remove people from the "isolated reality of consumer comforts".&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt;

===Blackspot Shoes campaign===
In 2004, the foundation began selling [[vegan]], indy shoes. The name and logo are "open-source";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522105440/http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php |archivedate=22 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php# ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to each pair was a "Rethink the Cool" leaflet, inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots&amp;nbsp;– one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for "kicking corporate ass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veganline.com/rethinkthecool.htm |title=Rethink the Cool - from Adbusters |website=Veganline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker.  The V1 is designed to resemble the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]-owned [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] (Nike bought Converse in 2003).&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Aitch, Iain |title=Kicking against the system |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |work=The Independent |date=15 December 2003 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206133717/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |archivedate=6 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a V1 in "fiery red."

The V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer [[John Fluevog]]. It is made from organic [[hemp]] and [[recycled]] car tires.

After an extensive search for [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs&lt;ref name="adbusters.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |title=Blackspot – Blackspot Shoes |publisher=Adbusters.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing.&lt;ref name="adbusters.org" /&gt;

Adbusters describes its goals vis-à-vis Blackspot as follows:

{{quote|Blackspot shoes is our experiment with grassroots capitalism. After spending many years railing against the practices of megacorporations like McDonalds, Starbucks and Nike, we wanted to prove that running an ethical, environmentally responsible business is possible ... and that taking market share away from megacorporations is better than whining about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Support + Subscribe | work = Adbusters.org | url = http://www.adbusters.org/support_subscribe | accessdate = 20 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120519224410/http://www.adbusters.org/support_subscribe | archivedate = 19 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Text 'hidden' under the "Why do we sell?" tab.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Reception====
Heath and Potter's ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe's existence proves that "no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture."&lt;ref name="rebel" /&gt;

In the June 2008 cover story of ''[[Businessweek|BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine]]'', the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on "antipreneurs." Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article's "Ask the Experts" sidebar.  Brian Martin of ''Brand Connections'' and Dave Weaver of [[TM Advertising]] both gave the campaign favorable reviews.

Martin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, "We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters," while Weaver stated that "This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Meet the Antipreneurs | date = June–July 2008 |publisher = businessweek.com | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_66/s0806039879656.htm?chan=search | accessdate =31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Text on the poster reads: "What is our one demand?#OCCUPYWALLSTREET September 17th. Bring Tent."]] --&gt;
In mid-2011, Adbusters Foundation proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Andrew|title=Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest Vancouver-based activists behind street actions in the U.S|url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|publisher=The Vancouver Courier|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=30 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AIbOo25w?url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|archivedate=30 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in [[Tahrir Square#2011 Egyptian Revolution|Tahrir Square]] with the [[consensus decision making]] of the [[2011 Spanish protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/micah-white-adbusters-_b_996931.html Sira Lazar "Occupy Wall Street: Interview With Micah White From Adbusters"], Huffington Post, 7 October 2011, at 3:40 in interview&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters' senior editor [[Micah M. White|Micah White]] said they had suggested the protest via their email list and it "was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world."&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Adbusters' website said that from their "one simple demand—a presidential commission to separate money from politics" they would "start setting the agenda for a new America."&lt;ref name="wallstreet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/adbusters-blog/occupywallstreet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63DZ1nIDl?url=http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/adbusters-blog/occupywallstreet.html |archivedate=15 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic [[Charging Bull]].&lt;ref name="inline.poster"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Link (newspaper)|The Link]]|title=The Ballerina and the Bull: Adbusters' Micah White on 'The Last Great Social Movement'|first=Laura|last=Beeston|date=11 October 2011|url=http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/1951|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nation.FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupy Wall Street: FAQ|first=Nathan|last=Schneider|date=29 September 2011|work=[[The Nation]]|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/163719/occupy-wall-street-faq|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 2011 it was the staff at the magazine that created the #OCCUPYWALLSTREET hashtag on Twitter.&lt;ref name=branding/&gt;

While the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since [[Occupy movement|grown worldwide]].

==Criticisms==
===Commercial style===
The foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are too similar to the media and commercial product that adbusters attack, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Carrie. "[http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm Culture Jamming (tm): Brought To You By Adbusters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825220611/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm |date=25 August 2005 }}." ''[[Stay Free!]]''. Retrieved 13 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath and Potter posit that the more alternative or [[subversion|subversive]] the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values.&lt;ref name="rebel" /&gt;

The Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing technique which it denounces other companies for using by originally purchasing much advertising space for the shoe.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

===Legal issues===
Adbusters launched a legal challenge in 1995. A second in 2004 was against CBC, CTV, CanWest and CHUM, for refusing to air anti-consumerism commercials, therefore infringing on the staff's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friesen|first=Joe|title=Adbusters sing networks for not airing its TV spots|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=15 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a CHUM representative is quoted as saying the ads "were so blatantly against television and that is our entire core business. You know we can't be selling our airtime and then telling people to turn their TVs off."&lt;ref name="Friesen"/&gt;

===Antisemitism===
&lt;!--Editors wishing to make substantive edits to this section are advised to peruse the relevant discussions that have taken place at the article's Discussion page.--&gt;
In March 2004, ''Adbusters'' was accused of [[antisemitism]] after running an article titled "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?" The article compiled a list of [[neoconservative]] supporters within the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] and marked the names of those it perceived as Jewish with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel's role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the Middle East were not a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="AdbustersJewish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |title=Why won't anyone say they are Jewish? |author = [[Kalle Lasn|Lasn, Kalle]] | date = March–April 2004 |publisher=Adbusters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223012106/http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |archivedate= 23 February 2004 |deadurl=yes |quote=Here at Adbusters, we decided to tackle the issue head on and came up with a carefully researched list of who appear to be the 50 most influential neocons in the US (see above). Deciding who exactly is a neocon is difficult since some neocons reject the term while others embrace it. Some shape policy from within the White House, while others are more peripheral, exacting influence indirectly as journalists, academics and think tank policy wonks. What they all share is the view that the US is a benevolent hyper power that must protect itself by reshaping the rest of the world into its morally superior image. And half of them are Jewish.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Adbusters, Max Cleland, and more |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/794ebwmq.asp |work=The Weekly Standard |date=8 March 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |postscript= |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071226054703/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/794ebwmq.asp |archivedate=26 December 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffective activism===
Some critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference.&lt;ref name="1 April 2009" /&gt;  Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign "[[Buy Nothing Day]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These critics feel a need for "resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The '''American Chamber of Commerce Japan''' ('''ACCJ''') is a non-profit business organization consisting mainly of executives from American companies.  Currently, the ACCJ has members that represent over 1,000 companies with offices located in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.  Working closely with the governments of the United States and Japan, business organizations and others, the ACCJ actively promotes activities that help achieve its mission of further developing commerce between the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ: About the ACCJ|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/en/about/about-the-accj|publisher=ACCJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The  ACCJ was established in 1948 by representatives of 40 American companies. Originally, the ACCJ had six committees and nine board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ: History|url=http://www.ajstokyo.org/ajs_j/samuel_h_kidder-j.html|accessdate=15 May 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223152013/http://www.ajstokyo.org/ajs_j/samuel_h_kidder-j.html|archive-date=2013-02-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCJ claims to be Japan’s most influential foreign business organization, and serves as the primary forum for the foreign business community in Japan to identify and pursue shared interests and goals. There are more than sixty Chamber committees, subcommittees, task forces, and advisory councils that cover such diverse areas as: financial services, corporate social responsibility, marketing, independent business, healthcare services, e-business, transportation and logistics, legal services, the travel industry, and human resource management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ: Committees|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/en/about/committees/accj-committees|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

The ACCJ committees combined hold over 500 programs annually, and these events are exclusively attended by ACCJ members and their accompanied guests. The backbone of the annual agenda is hundreds of engagements with leading experts and shapers of policy and business trends in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APCAC|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/noda/statement/201203/02summit_e.html|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers are drawn from the ranks of global business leaders, top U.S. and Japanese government officials, industry experts, scholars and pop culture icons. Former speakers Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe; JP Morgan Japan Director of Research, Jesper Koll; [[Rakuten]] Inc CEO, [[Hiroshi Mikitani]]; [[General Electric]] CEO, [[Jeffrey R. Immelt]]; [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] CEO, [[Tom J.

==Advocacy==

As a key stakeholder in the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, the ACCJ works to influence the discussions that frame policy in both countries.  The ACCJ issues its official positions on policy issues in Viewpoint position papers, white papers, public comments and other reports.  The ultimate goal of these policy positions and the advocacy carried out to communicate them and promote their implementation is to further the mission of the ACCJ to improve the business environment in Japan for Chamber members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ:Advocacy|url=http://www.tokyoweekender.com/2007/06/accj/|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACCJ Board of Governors (as of 2018)==

Leadership positions within the ACCJ are held by elected officials who represent top-level Japanese businesspeople and expats in Japan from the U.S. and around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ Leadership|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/en/about/leadership|accessdate=2 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18039">An '''application for employment''' is a standard business document which is prepared with questions deemed relevant by an [[employer]] in order for the employer to determine the best [[candidate]] to be given the responsibility of fulfilling the work needs of the company.  Most companies provide such forms to anyone upon request at which point it becomes the responsibility of the applicant to complete the [[form (document)|form]] and returning it to the employer at will for consideration.  The completed and returned document notifies the company of the applicants availability and desire to be employed and their [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]] and background so a determination can be made as to which candidate should be hired.

[[File:Southmayd letter 1 0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A job application letter dated January 1, 1913]]
[[File:Southmayd letter 2 0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Rejection letter dated January 16, 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruminski|first1=Clayton|title=Manuscripts and Archives: Early Twentieth Century Job Applications - A Personal Affair|website=Hagley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Definition==
From the employer's perspective, the application serves a number of purposes. These vary depending on the nature of the job and the preferences of the person responsible for hiring, as "each organization should have an application form that reflects its own environment".&lt;ref name=DA111&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, an application usually requires the applicant to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that he or she is legally permitted to be employed. The typical application also requires the applicant to provide information regarding relevant [[skill]]s, [[education]], and [[experience]] (previous employment or volunteer work). The application itself is a minor test of the applicant's [[literacy]], [[penmanship]], and [[communication skills]] - a careless job applicant might disqualify themselves with a poorly filled-out application.

The application may also require the applicant to disclose any [[criminal record]], and to provide information sufficient to enable the employer to conduct an appropriate [[background check]]. For a business that employs workers on a [[part-time]] basis, the application may inquire as to the applicant's specific times and days of availability, and preferences in this regard. It is important to note, however, that an employer may be prohibited from asking applicants about characteristics that are not relevant to the job, such as their political view or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=DA111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Weiss, ''Fair, Square &amp; Legal: Safe Hiring, Managing &amp; Firing Practices to Keep You and Your Company Out of Court'' (2004), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs, particularly those requiring communication skills, the employer will typically require applicants to accompany the form with a [[cover letter]] and a [[résumé]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Bunting, ''The Interviewer's Handbook: Successful Interviewing Techniques for the Workplace'' (2005), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even employers who accept a cover letter and résumé will frequently also require the applicant to complete a form application, as the other documents may neglect to mention details of importance to the employers.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Kennedy, ''The Small Business Owner's Manual'' (2005), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, an application is effectively used to dissuade "walk-in" applicants, serving as a barrier between the applicant and a [[job interview]] with the person with the authority to hire.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many businesses, applications for employment can be filled out online, and do not have to be submitted in person. However, it is still recommended that applicants bring a printed copy of their application to an interview.&lt;ref&gt;A C "Buddy" Krizan, Patricia Merrier, Joyce P. Logan, ''Business Communication'' (2010), p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Application blanks are the second most common hiring instrument next to personal interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Tarun|title=Role of Application Blank in the Selection Process|url=http://gradsup.com/application-blank-in-selection-process|publisher=GradsUp|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307052125/http://gradsup.com/application-blank-in-selection-process/|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies will occasionally use two types of application blanks, short and long.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} They both help companies with initial screening and the longer form can be used for other purposes as well. The answers that applicants choose to submit are helpful to the company because they can become an interview question for that applicant at a future date.

==Standardization and Regulation==
The employment application is not a standardized form so every company may create its own as long as [[regulations]] set by the government are adhered.  &lt;!-- in the US, this would be EEOD --&gt;

==Document Elements==
Applications usually ask the applicant at the minimum for their name, phone number, and address.  In addition, applications also ask for previous employment information, educational background, emergency contacts, references, as well as any special skills the applicant might have.

The three categories application fields are very useful for discovering are; physical characteristics, experience, and environmental factors.

===Physical characteristics===
If the company has a [[bona fide occupational qualification]] (BFOQ) to ask regarding a physical condition, they may ask questions about it,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} for example:
:The job requires a lot of physical labor. Do you have any physical problems that may interfere with this job?

===Experience===
Experience requirements can be separated into two groups on an application, work experience and educational background.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Educational background is important to companies because by evaluating applicants' performance in school tells them what their personality is like as well as their intelligence. Work experience is important to companies because it will inform the company if the applicant meets their requirements. Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed and when/why the applicant left their previous job.

===Socio-environmental qualifications===
Companies are interested in the applicant's [[social environment]] because it can inform them of their personality, interests, and qualities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} If they are extremely active within an organization, that may demonstrate their ability to communicate well with others. Being in management may demonstrate their leadership ability as well as their determination and so on.

===Photograph===
Customs vary internationally when it comes to the inclusion or non-inclusion of a [[photograph]] of the applicant. In the English-speaking countries, notably the United States, this is not customary, and books or websites giving recommendations about how to design an application typically advise against it unless explicitly requested by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/should-include-photo-cover-letter-resume-job-application-11576.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229025658/http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/should-include-photo-cover-letter-resume-job-application-11576.html |archivedate=2013-12-29 |df= }}, accessed 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, for instance Germany, the inclusion of a photograph of the applicant is still common, and many employers would consider an application incomplete without it.

==In other non-English speaking European countries==

===France===
In [[France]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Equal Opportunities Act (France)|fr|3=Loi pour l'égalité des chances|lt=2006 Equal Opportunities Act}} requires companies with more than 50 employees to request an anonymous application (''{{lang|fr|CV anonyme}}'').

===Germany===
The job application is called ''Bewerbung'' in Germany and usually consists of three parts, such as the ''Anschreiben'', the ''Lebenslauf'' and the ''Zeugnisse''. ''Anschreiben'' is the German word for [[Cover Letter]] and aims at the same goal: convincing the employer to submit an invitation for a [[job interview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tt-bewerbungsservice.de/applying-in-germany.html |title=Applying in Germany,  Bewerbung: Anschreiben and Lebenslauf |publisher=T. Tauber (German) |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329023800/http://www.tt-bewerbungsservice.de/applying-in-germany.html |archivedate=2015-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to work with the paper size [[DIN A4]] and to stay with a length of one single page. The ''Anschreiben'' must be signed by hand and accompanied by a ''Lebenslauf'', the [[Curriculum Vitae]], and ''Zeugnisse'' as copies of relevant reference documents. The ''Lebenslauf'' is of an anti-chronological structure and should give information on work experience, education and [[professional training]] as well as on applicant's skills. In Germany, the ''Lebenslauf'' – respectively the Curriculum Vitae – usually includes a photograph called ''Bewerbungsfoto''. Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the [[photograph]] to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. A length of two pages is to be aimed at when generating the ''Lebenslauf''. In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (''Bewerbungsmappe'') or online (''Onlinebewerbung''). According to a study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_70955.aspx |title=Internet überholt die Bewerbungsmappe auf Papier |publisher=BITKOM (German) |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122506/http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_70955.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Onlinebewerbung'' was more favored in Germany than the ''Bewerbungsmappe'' by 2012. Presumably, this development will persist..

===Italy===
The CV is the most important part of the application and should not be longer than two to three pages. It is divided into three areas:

in chronological order
* Details of the person (Informazioni personali)
* School and education (Studi e Formazione)

in anti-chronological order
* additional capabilities (Altre conoscenze) 
* Experience (Esperienze professionali). As graduate this section is omitted. Brief information on the application motivations may be mentioned here.

The application letter (La Lettera di accompagnamento al curriculum) will be taken relatively short, polite and formal in Italian applications. Long versions and extensively explained motivations, as well as photos and copies of certificates shall be presented only at the interview.

===Spain===
In Spain, the application consists of two parts: the cover letter (''Carta de Candidatura'') and the CV. No work or training certificates are attached. The cover letter should contain information on the motivation and drafted shortly. The CV should be structured in a tabular form. In Spain, multiple job interviews in the same company are common.

==Usage by hackers==
Job applications are known to be used by hackers to get employees to open [[Email attachment|attachments]] or links or connect [[USB_flash_drive_security#Malware_infections|USB sticks]] with [[malware]]. As companies typically have more financial resources than private individuals they are often a target of [[cyberextortion]] − so called [[ransomware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindner|first1=Martin|title=Computerkriminalität: Hacker im Spital|url=https://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/computerkriminalitaet-hacker-im-spital-ld.143720|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209002241/https://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/computerkriminalitaet-hacker-im-spital-ld.143720|archivedate=9 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning: Malware is showing up in job applicants’ files|url=http://www.hrmorning.com/warning-malware-is-showing-up-in-job-applicants-files/|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081457/http://www.hrmorning.com/warning-malware-is-showing-up-in-job-applicants-files/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ransomware such as "Petya"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Email scam Petya locks down PCs until a ransom is paid|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/petya-malware/|publisher=Digital Trends|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=25 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081954/http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/petya-malware/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angebliches Bewerbungsschreiben: Ransomware Petya verschlüsselt Master File Table|url=http://www.zdnet.de/88264556/angebliches-bewerbungsschreiben-ransomware-petya-verschluesselt-master-file-table/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=de-DE|date=29 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080450/http://www.zdnet.de/88264556/angebliches-bewerbungsschreiben-ransomware-petya-verschluesselt-master-file-table/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "GoldenEye"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoldenEye ransomware disguised as job application|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/malware/27866/goldeneye-ransomware-disguised-as-job-application|publisher=IT PRO|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081426/http://www.itpro.co.uk/malware/27866/goldeneye-ransomware-disguised-as-job-application|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmer|first1=Danny|title=This ransomware targets HR departments with fake job applications|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-targets-hr-departments-with-fake-job-applications/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080335/http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-targets-hr-departments-with-fake-job-applications/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoldenEye Ransomware analysiert|url=http://www.security-insider.de/goldeneye-ransomware-analysiert-a-577610/|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080937/http://www.security-insider.de/goldeneye-ransomware-analysiert-a-577610/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziemann|first1=Frank|title=Goldeneye: Bewerbungs-Mails mit Erpresser-Malware|url=http://www.pcwelt.de/news/Bewerbungs-Mails-mit-Erpresser-Malware-10088421.html|publisher=PC-WELT|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080641/http://www.pcwelt.de/news/Bewerbungs-Mails-mit-Erpresser-Malware-10088421.html|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were found to make use of job applications.

===Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] of Commerce degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|title=Bachelor Of Commerce (Bcom) - Varsity College|website=www.varsitycollege.co.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131853/https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business (see aside). 
Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, business management, human resources, marketing, and economics; some programs also require [[Business statistics|(business) statistics]], [[Business mathematics#University level|(introductory) calculus]] and information systems. 
Depending on the institution, a formal [[academic major]] may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

For a comparison with other business degrees, see [[Business education#Undergraduate education]].

===Honours Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Honours degree|Honours]] Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com. (Hons) or B.Comm. (Hons) or H.B.Com. or H.B.Comm.) is further advanced. It may consist of a four-year program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|title=Bachelor of Commerce Degree (Bcom)- University Canada West|website=ucanwest.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044341/https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|archivedate=2016-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoit.ca/ac-calendar/0506/EN/main/programs/103887/bcom_hons_92.html|title=Commerce - Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)|first=The University of Ontario Institute of|last=Technology|website=www.uoit.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year [[Bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105318/http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree requires additional academic courses to be completed with higher academic performance standards and may also require a researched [[thesis]] component; the one-year program is often focused exclusively on a single subject-area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|title=Qualifications|website=www.unisa.ac.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216065503/http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|archivedate=2014-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126230943/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |archivedate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours|title=BCom Students - Faculty of Business and Economics|website=bcom.unimelb.edu.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005629/http://www.bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours/|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Master of Commerce]] (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degrees.

===Duration===
The [[curriculum]] generally lasts three years in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Malta]], [[South Africa]], some parts of [[Canada]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The curriculum requires four years of study in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the majority of [[Canada]], [[Ghana]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In [[Nepal]], the duration of the program can be three years.

In [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and some universities in [[India]], the B.Com. (Hons) degree is considered an additional [[postgraduate]] qualification, whereas in [[Malta]], an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification. In [[Pakistan]], [http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/22/Hailey-College-of-Commerce] the B.Com. degree lasts two years, the B.Com. (Hons) degree lasts three years, and a four-year program leads to the BS (Hons) Commerce degree.

==History==
:''See: [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|Birmingham Business School#History and background]].''&lt;!--{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}} --&gt;
The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the [[University of Birmingham]]. The [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|University's School of Commerce]] was founded by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], an Englishman from [[Oxford University]], who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Toronto]]. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at [[Harvard University]], and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce.  Ashley began the program which was the forerunner of many other B.Com. degree programs throughout the [[British Empire]].

Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham program in Commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.

'''Borf''' was a [[graffiti]] campaign seen in and around [[Washington, D.C.]] during 2004 and 2005, carried out by John Tsombikos while studying at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]]. This four letter word was ubiquitous around the [[Washington, D.C. (northwest)|Northwest]] quadrant of Washington, and ranged from simple tagging to complete sentences to two-color stencils to the massive defacement on an overhead exit sign from the [[Theodore Roosevelt Bridge]] to [[Constitution Avenue]].&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{cite web

One of the most visible tags was the "BUSH HATES BORF" message painted above other graffiti on the back wall of the Vision Lighting Building and visible from the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Metro Red Line]] near the [[Takoma station|Takoma Metro station]]. This message was later replaced by a message saying "OBAMA HATES BORF" in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ggwash.org/view/11799/obama-hates-borf-buffed-from-the-red-line |title="Obama hates BORF" buffed from the Red Line|publisher=Greater Greater Washington|author= John Muller |date=2012-02-08|accessdate=2009-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graffiti was also reported to have appeared in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/04/13/borf_on_the_wes.php |title=Borf on the West Coast? |publisher=Dcist.com |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407131425/http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/04/13/borf_on_the_wes.php |archivedate=2007-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]],&lt;ref name="Sung 1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ellen Sung |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/324689.html |title='Borf' is watching us, |publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022205254/http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/324689.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sung 2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ellen Sung |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/230481.html |title=Arrest may end artist's spree |publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022205249/http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/230481.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rome, Italy]],&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/09/07/the_borf_saga_c.php |title=The Borf Saga Continues...

In 2009, director Paris Bustillos created a documentary film about the campaign entitled ''Borf!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphoppress.com/2009/03/borf-and-chocolate-city-burning-a-private-screening-of-two-films-documenting-graffiti-culture-in-was.html |title=Borf! and Chocolate City Burning |publisher=hiphoppress.com | date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The campaign attracted widespread attention without first explaining its motivations. According to Tsombikos and subsequent Borf communiqués, both the nickname "Borf" and the Borf face belonged to Bobby Fisher, a close friend of Tsombikos' who had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="libsyn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dissonance.libsyn.com/ |title=Borf Brigade interview on Dissonance Radio |publisher=Dissonance.libsyn.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video shown on July 29, 2006, the Borf Brigade – the group claiming responsibility for the graffiti spree – asserted that capitalism and the culture of aesthetics created alienation and feelings of worthlessness that contributed to the 16-year-old's suicide. The group said that they used other peoples' property to commemorate and pay homage to their deceased friend. The graffiti usually had overtones of anti-authority sentiments and [[Youth Rights|youth liberation]].&lt;ref name="Communique"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Borf Brigade Communique

| publisher = visualresistance.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court appearance==
Approximately four months after his arrest, Tsombikos appeared before the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia]]. His paint-stained coat, which resembled one that he wore in [[Libby Copeland]]'s July 14 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article (published after his arrest), was declared evidence by the judge and handed over to the prosecution.

On December 12, 2005, Tsombikos agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony destruction of property. He also agreed to perform community service (cleaning up graffiti) and to pay $12,000 in restitution. Judge Leibovitz ordered him to stay out of the District except for court appearances and classes at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]].

On February 9, 2006, Tsombikos was sentenced to 30 days in the D.C. jail, with an additional 17 months suspended, as well as the community service and restitution specified in his plea agreement. At his sentencing, the judge said, "You profess to despise rich people. You profess to despise the faceless, nameless forms of government that oppress. That's what you've become. That's what you are. You're a rich kid who comes into Washington and defaces property because you feel like it. It's not fair. It's not right."&lt;ref name="Sentencing"&gt;{{cite news

==Communiqués==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2007}}
At a [[Dupont Circle]] event after Borf's arrest, young people distributed spray paint and anarchist pamphlets.&lt;ref name="Borf-In"&gt;[http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/07/24/a_borf-in_at_du.php "A Borf-in at Dupont Circle", DCist.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019085916/http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/07/24/a_borf-in_at_du.php |date=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following was distributed as a "communiqué" at the event:

On July 29, 2006, a group of young people calling themselves the "Borf Brigade" held a march in the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood of Washington, and projected a "video communiqué" on a wall in which a young woman wearing a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]]-style face mask read a statement labeling Tsombikos a "minor Borfist" and announced that he had been "purged" from the group.&lt;ref name="Communique" /&gt; The video also said,

{{quote|On October 22, 2003, our friend Borf hanged himself from a basement pipe in a suburb of the nation's capital. This was not a solitary act. Over 30,000 people in the U.S. alone fall victim to this conspiratorial violence. It is the third leading killer of young people ages 15-24, and outnumbers homicides 3 to 2. This epidemic cannot be medicated into remission. It is not a problem confined to our family bloodline. "Trouble at home" is not the only trigger for depression.}}

==Consolation of Ruin art show==
[[File:Bobby Fisher Memorial Building tag.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Borf piece on the side of the Bobby Fisher Memorial Building in Washington, D.C.]]
In April 2007, wheat-pasted posters announcing a "BORF SHOW" slated for the weekends of May 18–20 and May 25–27 began appearing around Washington. The location was "The Bobby Fisher Memorial Building" at 1644 North Capitol Street NW.&lt;ref name="libsyn1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borfyou.com/ |title=Borfyou.com |publisher=Borfyou.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP Borf"&gt;{{cite news

The show, entitled "Consolation of Ruin" and sponsored by [[philanthropist]] Chuck Burgundy,{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} featured two floors of oil paintings, screen prints, etchings, installations, and video, all for sale in an effort to pay for Tsombikos' $12,000 restitution. One installation (a direct reference to Banksy's "[[elephant in the room]]" piece) was of a male figure hanging from a belt from the ceiling and painted to match the wallpaper designs on the wall, camouflaging the lifeless figure. A number of the original stencils used in the graffiti campaign were on display.&lt;ref name="Indymedia Show"&gt;{{cite news

A '''budtender''' is a title of a staff member who works within a [[dispensary]] or store where medical or recreational [[cannabis]] is sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/11/11/marijuana_legalization_and_language_budtenders_ganjapreneurs_420_joints.html|title=How Will Legalization Affect the Language Around Marijuana?|last=Dictionaries|first=Oxford|date=2014-11-11|work=Slate|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their job is to offer suggestions to customers, answer questions, handle products and showcase products being sold.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2014/06/13/marijuana-terms-and-definitions-cannabis-lexicon-glossary-pot-terminology/13174/|title=The definitive cannabis lexicon: Marijuana terms from A-Z|date=2014-06-13|work=The Cannabist|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Budtender, a term recognized by [[Merriam-Webster]] as of March 2018,&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/budtender-as-marijuana-goes-legal-so-does-its-slang|title=As Marijuana Goes Mainstream, So Does Its Slang|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[portmanteau]] that combines the word [[bartender]] and [[bud]]. Like a bartender, budtenders serve customers within a licensed establishment while the word bud is referring to the dried flower tops of Cannabis used for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_basics.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis Vault: Basics|website=www.erowid.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications ==
The first budtenders gained knowledge through Cannabis farmers, extraction technicians, edible chefs and other cannabis experts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early days of legalized medical cannabis no prior schooling was needed to work as a budtender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of 2017, no [[license]] or [[certification]] is needed to be a budtender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because Cannabis is still illegal on a national level, no national licensing standards have been implemented.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/19/marijuana-salesperson-budtender-license/83958/|title=Do you need a license or certificate to be a budtender (weed salesperson)?|date=2017-07-19|work=The Cannabist|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most budtenders are self taught cannabis [[connoisseur]]s while some are trained formally. Training institutions include: Green CulturED, The Cannabis Training Institute, and Cannabis Trainers each with their own curriculum. For Green Cultured the total cost of the certifications is $119.00, Cannabis Training Institute is $299.00 for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecannabisreporter.com/want-budtender/|title=Want to Be A Budtender? Here's What You Need to Know|last=Bishop|first=Snowden|date=2016-05-19|work=The Cannabis Reporter|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions offer certifications in completed courses with subjects like [[Cannabis concentrate]]s, [[Cannabis consumption]], growing cannabis, cannabis laws and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some courses are offered online while some are workshop that require physical attendance.

== Careers ==

=== Experience and knowledge ===
[[File:Cannabis Dispensary flower.jpg|thumb|right|Budtender behind a counter with various cannabis strains, 2018]]

Budtenders have to be qualified to work in a dispensary and must have a wide range of cannabis knowledge. In order to provide customers with a positive experience at a dispensary, budtenders need to demonstrate their knowledge of [[Cannabis strains|strains]], [[Cannabis edible|cannabis products]] and [[Medical cannabis|medical use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/budtender-product-spotlight-austin-tucker-dockside-cannabis-sodo-seattle|title=Budtender Spotlight: 5 Favorites From Dockside’s Austin Tucker {{!}} Leafly|date=2017-04-26|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They need to know the characteristics of each strain of cannabis they sell, based on their taste, smell and [[Effects of cannabis|effects]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leafly.com/news/industry/how-to-get-hired-to-work-in-the-medical-cannabis-industry-part-2|title=How to Get Hired to Work in the Legal Cannabis Industry Part 2: Getting Hired as a Budtender {{!}} Leafly|date=2015-05-05|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a customer were to ask about a specific strain that the dispensary does not have, a budtender should be able to recommend a similar strain with their broad understanding of cannabis in terms of the attributes of the customer’s original request. A budtender should also be able to adhere to the necessity for a medical marijuana user. Their ability to understand the medical circumstances of certain strains is critical and essential for the safety of the customer. Budtenders may stay aware of cannabis trends is by checking [[social media]] and industry [[blog]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Customer service ===
Since budtenders work one-on-one with customers, it is essential that they provide a welcoming environment for them. A budtender's job is to provide and share their knowledge of cannabis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leafly.com/news/industry/4-traits-of-a-bad-cannabis-budtender|title=4 Bad Budtender Habits that Consumers Notice (and Hate) {{!}} Leafly|date=2015-08-13|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a customer, have the ability to teach those who have never tried cannabis before and to provide insight to new trends or strains. Budtenders also sometimes share stories&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in order to market to a customer and also to create a friendlier environment. These stories are meant to provide apprehension of what a customer might feel or do when they use a certain type of cannabis. However, budtenders are not recommended to push their products by telling fake stories and experiences in order to get a customer to buy something;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; this is considered bad customer service within the industry. Also, budtenders are commended when they have good hygiene when addressing or working with customers. Having clean hands and tidy attire&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; are critical when a budtender works with a customer. Budtenders are also recommended to use tongs or gloves&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; when pulling out a sample from a jar instead of reaching in with their bare hands. Finally, budtenders are also highly recommended to express a sense of passion for their product in order to spark interest from a customer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Income ===
Because the distribution and use of marijuana is illegal on a [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]], budtending salaries vary per state. However as of 2014, the general hourly income for a budtender is $11–12 per hour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cannarecruiter.com/budtender-job-description/|title=Budtender Job Description: What is a Budtender? Qualifications Overview|date=2016-11-28|work=Canna Recruiter|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the perks of being a budtender is that many dispensaries give [[Discounting|discounts]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; of their product to their employees. Budtenders will often get tips from their customers, and sometimes a yearly [[salary]] (with tips) can be from $31,000–$42,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cannabistraininguniversity.com/cannabis-job-salaries|title=Cannabis Job Salaries {{!}} Cannabis Training University|work=Cannabis Training University|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
In the United States, there are 9 states that have legalized recreational marijuana, and another 21 states that have made medical marijuana legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/where-can-you-can-legally-smoke-weed-2018-1|title=Here's where you can legally smoke marijuana in 2018|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budtenders in these states are held to state legislation, and must comply with state law.

===Oregon===
Oregon, one of the 9 recreational marijuana states, is regulated by the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] (OLCC), and require all budtenders to be at least 21 years or older to obtain a license and or permit.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Documents/Marijuana_Worker_Permit/MJ_WorkerPermitEducation_English.pdf|title=Recreational Marijuana Worker Permit Education|last=|first=|date=May 21, 2018|website=www.oregon.gov|archive-url=http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Documents/Marijuana_Worker_Permit/MJ_WorkerPermitEducation_English.pdf|archive-date=July 1, 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be production or processing purposes, any budtender who actively handles marijuana, must have a permit to secure or sell marijuana items.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Having these permits is necessary under Oregon law, however; permits are only valid for five years from the date issued by the OLCC. All permits under the commission grant an employee access to any licensed marijuana business in the state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Being a fairly regulated business, all budtenders are required by state law to have their worker permits readily available at any time while working, in case of immediate inspection by OLCC regulatory staff or enforcement officer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is advised to keep the permit on one's self when working, for this immediate reason. If a budtender who possesses a legal permit were to be convicted by the state for misdemeanor or felony, they have 10 days to submit a written notification to the Commission.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; No permit is transferable; the permit to sell recreational marijuana belongs to the permittee.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The only applicable license type that allows the sale of marijuana items to a consumer is the retail license. Every retailer must verify the age of every customer, for any and all purchases, and can only sell between the hours of 7am-10pm.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A budtender cannot offer free samples to customers, give free marijuana items, or provide any form of discount if the sale is inline with the sale of other items. Retailers may only receive marijuana products from the OLCC licensed producers, processors, and wholesalers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7974">The '''cement industry in the United States''' produced {{convert|82.8 |e6t}} of [[cement]] in 2015, worth US$9.8 billion, and was used to manufacture concrete worth about US$50 billion. The US was the world's third-largest producer of cement, after [[Cement industry in China|China]] and [[India]]. The US [[cement industry]] includes 99 [[cement mill]]s in 34 states, plus two plants in [[Puerto Rico]]. The industry directly employed 10,000 workers in 2015. Ten percent of the cement used in the United States in 2015 was imported.&lt;ref name="Summary"&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/ Cement], Mineral Commodity Summary, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The types and amounts of cement produced in 2015 were:
* [[Portland cement]]  80.4 million tons
* Masonry cement  2.4 million tons
* Other [[hydraulic cement]]  0.6 million tons

Cement production is predominantly [[portland cement]], which is mostly used in concrete. Cement for concrete is an essential material for construction, and demand is a function of construction spending. Single-family residential construction is considered only moderately cement-intensive; multifamily residential somewhat more intensive. Nonresidential construction and government construction projects are considered the most cement-intensive.

In 2013, 70.8 percent of portland cement was sold as [[ready-mix concrete]], such as is delivered in cement-mixer trucks. 11.5 percent was sold dry to contractors and construction materials stores; 11.3 percent was sold to manufacturers of concrete products; 4.6 percent was sold for oil and gas wells, and 1.8 percent was sold to government agencies and others.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/myb1-2013-cemen.pdf Cement], Minerals Yearbook, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Because cement is a bulk commodity, transportation can be a significant part of the cost. To minimize transportation costs, cement plants are ideally located close to the market, with access to efficient transportation such as ship or railroad. Most cement plants are located close to the limestone deposits.

Thirty-four states have cement manufacturing plants. In 2013, the five leading cement-producing states, in descending order, were: [[Texas]], [[California]], [[Missouri]], [[Florida]], and [[Alabama]]. Together, the five accounted for almost half of US cement production. The list of top five cement-consuming states is similar: Texas, California, Florida, [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;

In 2015, about 10 percent of US cement consumption came from imports. The largest sources of US cement imports were [[Canada]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="Summary"/&gt;

==Industry structure==
In 2013, the top producers of portland cement in the US were:&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;

* 1 - [[CEMEX]]
* 2 - [[Holcim]] (now [[LafargeHolcim]])
* 3 - Lehigh Hanson Inc.
* 4 - [[Buzzi Unicem]]
* 5 - [[Ash Grove Cement Company]] (to be acquired by [[CRH plc]] in early 2018)
* 6 - [[Lafarge North America]] (merged with Holcim in 2015)
* 7 - [[Texas Industries Inc]]
* 8 - Eagle Minerals Inc.
* 9 - Essroc Cement Corp.
* 10 - St. Marys Cement Group

In 2013, the top 5 companies produced 54 percent of US portland cement; the top 10 companies produced 78 percent.

==Inputs==
Portland cement is a complex mixture, mostly calcium, with admixtures of aluminium, silica, and iron. The choice of source materials depends on local availability. The calcium is usually supplied by limestone, but sometimes shell or coral. Slightly clayey limestones are preferable, because they already contain the necessary aluminium. Cement cannot contain more than 5 percent magnesium, so the limestone must be low in magnesium.

Energy sources used in the US to manufacture cement in 2013 were:
* Coal  6.0 million metric tons
* Petroleum coke  1.6 million metric tons
* Solid waste  1.1 million metric tons
* Used tires  0.4 million metric tons
* Oil  15.7 million liters
* Liquid waste  0.8 million liters
* Natural gas  694 million cubic meters
* Electricity  10.5 billion kilowatt-hours

==Environmental Effects==
The cement industry has both positive and negative effects on the environment.

===Source of waste and pollutants===
Cement manufacture is a source of the following airborne contaminants: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch11/final/c11s06.pdf Cement manufacture], US EPA, accessed 1 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cement production releases carbon dioxide by [[sintering]] limestone or shells. It is also very energy-intensive, with the result that the cement industry is a large emitter of carbon dioxide.

===Destruction of waste and pollutants===
The high temperatures of [[cement kiln]]s, the ability of concrete to incorporate different materials, and the stable and nonreactive nature of the concrete end product, all make cement kilns a desirable method for the destruction of hazardous waste. 

Hazardous wastes efficiently destroyed by cement kilns include chlorinated solvents ([[methylene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[trichloromethane]], [[trichloroethane]], [[carbon tetrachloride]]), [[Freon]]-113, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), [[dioxin]], waste oil, and used hydrocarbon solvents. Whatever undesirable materials are not destroyed are locked in the finished concrete, a stable material with low permeability. Hydrocarbon waste and used tires contribute to the kiln heat, and reduces fuel use. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/trimewebhelp/test/WebHelp.1282016/section_4_5_3_cement_kilns_burning_hazardous_waste_as_supplemental_fuel.htm "Cement kilns burning hazardous waste as supplemental fuel], US Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to destruction of hazardous waste, waste materials from other industries, such as slag and fly ash, are commonly incorporated into cement, eliminating the need to landfill the waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industrialresourcescouncil.org/Applications/PortlandCementManufacturing/tabid/384/Default.aspx Portland cement manufacturing], Industrial Resources Council, accessed 1 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of cement to incorporate different materials allows contaminated soil to be added to the feed, eliminating the need to take the material to a hazardous waste landfill. The US EPA estimated that in 2014, 13.1 million tons of coal fly ash, which otherwise would have to be landfilled, was beneficially used in cement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-reuse&lt; Coal as reuse], US EPA, 24 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the use of fly ash improves the strength and durability of concrete&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/recycling/fach03.cfm Fly ash concrete for highways], US Dept. of Transportation, accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a term used in the [[Retailing|retail]] industry.   [[Retailing|Retailers]] contract with their [[Supply chain|suppliers]] to supply a quantity of product in a specified time period to a specific location at an agreed price.  The quantity and value of the [[balance of contract]] represents a risk to the retailer from the point of view that the retailer will have to discount a product that experiences a [[Demand curve|slump in demand]].   The setting of targets and maxima at various levels in the retailer's product hierarchies and time dimensions; and the subordination of purchasing to these limits, is known as "Commitment control".

Cortex states that once their master plan is completed, there will be $2.3 billion of construction and more than 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use development, including 13,000 jobs in technology.&lt;ref name="cortex-thedistrict" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpublicradio-aloft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

The current initiative for Cortex is called Cortex 3.0, $170 million expansion of Cortex to be completed in fall 2018.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eqstl.com/cortexs-evolution-life-science-district-magnet-st-louis-innovators-feature-series/ | title=Cortex’s Evolution From A Life Science District To A Magnet For St. Louis Innovators: A Feature Series | first=Mary | last=Mack | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=27 February 2017 | work=EQSTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eqstl.com/cortexs-evolution-life-science-district-magnet-st-louis-innovators-feature-series/ | title=Cortex Looks Ahead: Cortex Special Feature, Chapter 4, 2017 And Beyond | first=Mary | last=Mack | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=2 March 2017 | work=EQSTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1998, [[William Henry Danforth]], whom 3 years prior had retired as chancellor of [[Washington University]] in St. Louis, recognized that the region was not building upon its core strengths in medicine and plant sciences. He formed the Coalition for Plant and Life Sciences, now known as [[BioSTL]].&lt;ref name="ninenet-oral" /&gt;

This eventually led to the creation of the [[Donald Danforth Plant Science Center]].

Coming off that successful project, [[William Henry Danforth]] and [[John Dubinsky]], CEO of financial consulting firm [[Westmoreland Associates]] and the eventual chairman of the Cortex board, went to Cambridge to study [[Kendall Square]], the most notable [[innovation district]] to see how the concept could be used in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;

The idea for Cortex came from the idea to create a district where companies could have a presence with access to talent, new technology, labs and intellectual property in order to innovate.  The reason the [[Midtown St. Louis|Midtown neighborhood]] was selected for the location of Cortex is because the founding institutions are nearby and the Millenial Generation showed desire to live and work in the nearby urban areas.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="curbed-millenials"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/7/17658662/university-real-estate-development-startup| accessdate=18 September 2018 | title=Universities, chasing the startup economy, reshape urban real estate | first= Patrick | last=Sisson | date=7 Aug 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

Cortex as an organization was founded in 2002 by [[Washington University]] (WashU), [[BJC HealthCare]] (BJC), [[University of Missouri – St. Louis]] (UMSL), [[St. Louis University]] (SLU), and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;

Cortex is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization.&lt;ref name="cortex-whoweare"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cortexstl.com/who-we-are/ | accessdate=18 September 2018 | title=Cortex Official Who We Are }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

To start the initial nonprofit to purchase land, members contributed $29 million USD as collateral for loans and purchasing of land. Washington University provided $15 million, BJC and SLU gave $5 million each, and UMSL gave $4 million USD.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;

The Cortex West Redevelopment Corporation was classified by the city under Missouri statute Chapter 353, as a master developer of the district. St. Louis Mayar [[Francis Slay]] gave Cortex the ability to redevelop the area broadly in the "public interest" with the tools of issuing tax abatements and using [[eminent domain]] if necessary, as has been documented as least two times.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

The first hire by Cortex was CEO, Dennis Lower. Lower executed a plan called Cortex 2.0 and converted Cortex from a bioscience district to an open mixed-used district. Also part of Cortex 2.0 was a shift to startup technology companies.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution3"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eqstl.com/cortexs-evolution-life-science-district-magnet-st-louis-innovators-feature-series/ | title=Cortex Shifts Focus: Cortex Special Feature, Chapter 3, 2010-2016 | first=Mary | last=Mack | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=1 March 2017 | work=EQSTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer of 2014, [[Square, Inc.|Square]], the payments company setup by St. Louis natives [[Jim McKelvey]] and [[Jack Dorsey]] opened offices at Cortex 4240.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution3" /&gt;

In 2015, [[Ikea]] opened in Cortex.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution3" /&gt;

In 2018, [[Microsoft]] opened its first midwest headquarters in Cortex building 4220.&lt;ref name="curbed-millenials" /&gt;

In Fall 2018, once [[Venture Cafe|Venture Cafe Innovation Hall]] opens at the 4220 Building in Cortex, 23 City Blocks Hospitality Group's restaurant and cafe, The Chocolate Pig will open.&lt;ref name="feast-chocopig"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.feastmagazine.com/the-feed/st_louis_news/article_e7ee9272-3d93-11e8-b775-b773792b4624.html | title=The Chocolate Pig to Open at Cortex Innovation Hall This Fall | first=Nancy | last=Stiles | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=11 April 2018 | work=Feast Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, [[Aon (company)|AON]] announced it was relocating 200 of its employees to the Cortex new 4220 building.&lt;ref name="stltoday-aon"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/aon-relocating-employees-from-clayton-to-st-louis-cortex-district/article_04bcae19-7754-5009-8ed4-0836c00cca0f.html | title=Aon relocating 200 employees from Clayton to St. Louis' Cortex district | first=Brian | last=Feldt | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=8 June 2018 | work=[[St. Louis Post Dispatch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

The Cortex Innovation Community is located in the [[Midtown St. Louis|Midtown neighborhood]]. It is over 200 acres of land and is situated nearby St. Louis’ [[Central West End]] and [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]] neighborhoods. It is next to internationally known [[Washington University]], its medical campus, [[St. Louis University]], and [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]]. Cortex is near cultural institutions including the [[Grand Center Arts District, St. Louis|Grand Center Arts District]] and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]. Cortex is next to [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], which is home to the [[St. Louis Zoo]], the [[St. Louis Art Museum]], the [[St. Louis Science Center]], the [[Missouri History Museum]].

He is author of ''Who Cares Wins: Why Good Business Is Better Business''&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Who-Cares-Wins-business-Financial/dp/0273762532 |title=Who Cares Wins: Why good business is better business (Financial Times Series) (9780273762539): David Jones: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pearson/FT Publishing, November 2011) and the creator of the "Social Business Idea".

==Career==

Fluent in German, French and English, he began his career as an account executive at [[BDH Manchester]] (now [[TBWA]]) before moving to [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] in Paris and then [[Lowe Europe]]. Returning to London, he became the youngest board member at [[AMV BBDO]].

Jones' career with Havas began in 1998, when he was appointed CEO of Euro RSCG Australia at age 32. After launching the network's first digital agency, he became president of global brands for Euro RSCG Worldwide and served as global brand director on [[Reckitt Benckiser]]. In 2004 he was promoted to CEO of Euro RSCG New York and in 2005 he succeeded Jim Heekin as CEO of Euro RSCG Worldwide and also taking on duties as directeur general of Havas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-online.ru/eng/index.php3?id=23806 |title=Euro Rscg Chairman-Ceo Resigns |publisher=Media-online.ru |date=2 August 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Euro RSCG became the first agency to be named Global Agency of the Year by both [[Advertising Age]] and [[Advertising campaign|Campaign]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/global-agency-network-year-euro-rscg/114126/ |title=Global Agency Network of the Year: Euro RSCG &amp;#124; News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/610113/ |title=The Annual 2006: Advertising Network of the Year – Euro RSCG &amp;#124; Advertising news &amp;#124; Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Jones added the title of CEO of Havas Worldwide, running all the creative, marketing and design companies throughout the Havas network of 300+ offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/euro-chief-david-jones-oversees-80-havas/134949/ |title=Euro Chief David Jones Now Oversees 80% of Havas &amp;#124; Agency News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007–2010, Jones led the Euro RSCG team advising [[David Cameron]] and the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2011/mar/14/david-jones-tory-adman-enjoys-going-for-the-jugular |title=David Jones: the Tory ad-man who enjoys going for the jugular &amp;#124; James Silver &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 14 March 2011|accessdate=8 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Jones expanded his position to encompass the entire Havas network, including [[Havas Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/david-jones-named-ceo-havas-group/149283/ |title=David Jones Named CEO of Havas Group &amp;#124; News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named CEO of Havas.

In 2014 Jones left Havas and one year later he raised $350m and launched a new 'brandtech' group under the name "You &amp; Mr. Jones". &lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2016/02/15/new-york-says-shalom-to-israeli-startups/

==Change leadership==
David Jones is creator of the "Social Business Idea"—a principle and practice that "operates at the intersection of social responsibility and social media" and "aligns the goals of doing well and doing good."&lt;ref name="amazon1"/&gt; He cites the [[Dulux Let's Colour Project]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letscolourproject.com/ |title=Home – Let's Colour Project |publisher=Letscolourproject.com |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Business Ideas are a focus of Jones' book, Who Cares Wins: Why Good Business Is Better Business, scheduled to be published by Pearson/FT Publishing in late 2011.
At [[Mashable]] Connect 2011 and other forums, Jones has advocated using the communication skills of the advertising industry to drive social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/01/david-jones-connect-keynote/ |title=5 Key Shifts Happening Right Now in the World of Digital Marketing |publisher=Mashable.com |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told [[Adweek]] "I passionately believe that what our industry actually excels at is using our creativity to change people's behavior. Given the state of the world, I believe that we in the creative industries not only have an opportunity but an obligation to use that talent and our creativity to change people's behavior around some of the bigger issues facing the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chapman |first=Mike |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/beds-are-burning-climate-change-100485 |title='Beds Are Burning' for Climate Change |publisher=Adweek |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Jones co-founded youth forum [[One Young World]], called "arguably the most forward-looking and comprehensive piece of corporate social responsibility ever attempted"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choueke |first=Mark |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/collaborative-approach-marks-new-age-of-csr/3003613.article |title=Collaborative approach marks new age of CSR &amp;#124; News |publisher=Marketing Week |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Marketing Week]]. In 2011, Jones' work with One Young World was recognised by the [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Initiative .28CGI.29|Clinton Global Initiative.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=One |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/oneyoungworld/5035426813 |title=David Jones receiving Clinton Global Initiative for One Young World &amp;#124; Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In advance of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] in Copenhagen in 2009, Jones was asked by former U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] to create a campaign to communicate the urgent need for action. Jones drove the creation of the TckTckTck Campaign for Climate Justice, an open source campaign that recruited more than 17 million "climate allies" to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcktcktck.org/ |title=The Global Campaign for Climate Action : The Global Campaign for Climate Action |publisher=Tcktcktck.org |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 TckTckTck was short-listed for a [[Webby Award]] for world's best advocacy campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=14 |title=Webby Nominees |publisher=Webbyawards.com |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421181147/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=14 |archivedate=21 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and listed by [[The Guardian]] as one of the Top 50 climate tweeters in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards |first=Rhiannon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/may/11/top-50-twitter-climate-accounts |title=Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 11 May 2010|accessdate=8 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Business Idea==
In ''Who Cares Wins'', Jones defines the Social Business Idea as the overlap between what a company is good at ("a genuine and credible role for the brand or business"), and what consumers or customers are looking for ("real issues that consumers care about"). He lists as examples [[M·A·C]]'s Viva Glam cosmetics partnering with [[Lady Gaga]] to raise money and awareness for HIV;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.maccosmetics.com/whats_new/4800/index.tmpl?cm_mmc=Google-_-ENG_ENG%7cVanity%7cProduct%7cPhrase%7cPC-_-M%7cX%7cViva%20Glam%7cX%7cX%7cSPP%7cOK-_-Viva%20Glam |title=MAC Cosmetics: Viva Glam| date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Levi's]] Water&lt;Less jeans line, produced with lower water usage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://store.levi.com/waterless |title=Levi's: Water&lt;Less| date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] "Plan A"  environmental commitment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plana.marksandspencer.com/ |title=Marks &amp; Spencer: Plan A|date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] "Better World";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nikebetterworld.com/ |title=Nike Better World|date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pepsi Refresh Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.refresheverything.com/ |title=Nike Better World|date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17171">{{main|Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010}}

The Canadian auto industry is closely linked to the U.S., due to the [[Automotive Products Trade Agreement]] and later the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and is in similar trouble.  Canada's 3,500 car dealers, which employ 140,000 people, told the federal and Ontario governments in mid-November they are at risk from the financial crisis; they are asking the national government to help out despite a record year{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} of sales.  Ottawa is considering providing financial aid to the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, and possibly auto parts companies as well. The auto industry argued that loan guarantees and other help would try to save tens of thousands of Canadian jobs threatened by the sudden drop in North American car sales. Chrysler Canada has asked for $1 billion in aid, making it the only Canadian arm of the Big Three to make a specific dollar request.

Industry analyst Anthony Faria criticized the labor contracts that [[Canadian Auto Workers]] then-president [[Buzz Hargrove]] negotiated with the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three US automobile manufacturers]] in 2007, predicting that the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and currency would hit Canadian auto production especially hard. Faria noted that [[UAW]] president [[Ron Gettelfinger]] agreed to have the UAW's "all-in" wage, benefit and pension costs drop from a high of $75.86 per hour in 2007 to an average of about $51 per hour starting in 2010. By comparison, the CAW's cost per hour was $77 in 2007 and will rise to over $80 per hour by the end of the new contract. Faria said that Gettelfinger went into negotiations "with the right intention...Save jobs. The CAW strategy was to squeeze every dime out of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris Vander |last=Doelen |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=63a938bc-58fa-4795-9ec4-10741d105193 |title=Thousands of CAW auto job losses predicted |work=The Windsor Star |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215053440/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=63a938bc-58fa-4795-9ec4-10741d105193 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrove was said to have "instilled backbone and an attitude that the union could always make the auto makers buckle at the bargaining table".&lt;ref name="business.theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Derek Decloet |url=http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090309.wdecloet0310/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/home |title=reportonbusiness.com: Columns and Blogs |publisher=Business.theglobeandmail.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313035141/http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090309.wdecloet0310/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/home |archivedate=2009-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current union president [[Ken Lewenza, Sr.|Ken Lewenza]] has argued that labor is not responsible for the bankruptcy crisis facing the Big Three automakers, saying that his members would not make concessions part of any taxpayer-funded bailout. "We don't see this as us being the problem", Lewenza said, adding he would "absolutely not" accept any further cuts after losing tens of thousands of jobs in recent years. "We've suffered our share of pain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5grcl5q0uPoqkOoWENxe22Q3dbqwg]{{dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lawenza argued that the CAW agreed in 2007 to make concessions that will save the Big Three $900 million over three years.&lt;ref&gt;"Car dealers plead for government help," 
[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081121.wcdeals1121/BNStory/National/home ''The Canadian Press'' Nov. 21, 2008 online]; "Labour rates not a problem in auto industry: Lewenza," [http://www.edmontonsun.com/Business/News/2008/11/20/7474801.html Canadian Press, Nov. 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123013323/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081121.wcdeals1121/BNStory/National/home |date=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]] has criticized the CAW's "no-concession" stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that "It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to do anything to help itself to begin with", since they "fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Grace |last=Macaluso |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=c07f9882-2f99-4479-b067-831ac302129a |title=Lewenza 'petulant' child |work=The Windsor Star |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215051012/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=c07f9882-2f99-4479-b067-831ac302129a |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly McParland, a columnist for the [[National Post]], has suggested that "if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything." He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labor alike, criticizing labor for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelly |last=McParland |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/11/19/kelly-mcparland-stop-the-revolution-the-caw-wants-to-get-off.aspx |title=Kelly McParland: Stop the revolution, the CAW wants to get off |publisher=National Post |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-12 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTF has opposed the proposed $3.5 CAD billion bailout for Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, saying that it was an unfair financial burden on the average Canadian, as well as another excuse for the Detroit automakers to postpone much needed change. The CTF noted that federal and provincial governments spent $782-million in the past five years on the Big Three, saying "These have been a bottomless pit of requests for cash". Lewenza disagreed, saying that the bailout should be seen by Canadians as a loan that will be paid back when the country's economy is prosperous again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Nguyen |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=1073285 |title=Canadian taxpayers and auto union butt heads over bailout |agency=Canwest News Service |publisher=National Post |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, the government of Canada and the province of [[Ontario]] offered $3.3 billion in loans to the auto industry. Under the plan [[General Motors|GM]] will receive $3 billion and [[Chrysler]] will receive the rest. [[Ford]] only asked for a line of credit but will not be participating in the bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Austen |first=Ian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21canada.html?ref=business |title=Canada Agrees to Its Own Auto Industry Bailout |location=Canada |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAW negotiated a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract for an additional year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual "special bonus," and reduce special paid absences or "SPA days" from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a "major sacrifice." However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; DBRS analyst Kam Hon described it as "not material." Automotive industry consultant [[Dennis DesRosiers]] said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/CityandRegion/2009/03/09/8687446.html |title=London Free Press - City &amp; Region - GM missed the boat, auto analyst says |publisher=Lfpress.ca |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}{{dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill as a condition of the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking.&lt;ref name="business.theglobeandmail.com"/&gt; He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that "they [GM] got six or seven" when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in [[paid time off]] merely means "five fewer spa days." [[University of Toronto]] professor Joe D'Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support.

The agreement is contingent on Canada being allocated 20% of GM's North American, and getting billions of dollars in federal and provincial taxpayer support, which Lewenza stressed will be loans. However, some suggested that this would not be the final time that automakers would request a bailout.&lt;ref name="financialpost1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |title=John Ivison: Automotive bailout must not be free ride |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402161023/http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dennis DesRosiers estimated that GM will go through its government loans in a couple of quarters, long before any recovery in the market. Furthermore, GM Canada president Arturo Elias had admitted to MP [[Frank Valeriote]] that GM had pledged all its assets worldwide to the U.S. government in order to secure the first [[tranche]] of a US$30-billion loan, leaving no assets to collateralize the $6 billion loan from the Canadian government. The Canadian Taxpayers' Federation noted that between 1982 and 2005, Ottawa handed out over $18.2 billion to corporations, of which only $7.1 billion was repayable, and only $1.3 billion was ever repaid.
&lt;ref name="financialpost2"/&gt;

Chrysler vice-chairman and president [[Thomas W. LaSorda]] (himself the son of a CAW official) and Ford's chief of manufacturing Joe Hinrichs said that the GM-CAW deal was insufficient, suggesting that they would break the CAW's negotiating pattern set by GM. LaSorda told the [[House of Commons of Canada]] finance committee that he would demand an hourly wage cut of $20, suggested that Chrysler may withdraw from Canada if it fails to achieve more substantial cost savings from the CAW.

On March 31, 2009, the Canadian federal and Ontario governments jointly rejected the restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler. This came a day after US President [[Barack Obama]] had rejected the plans of their parent companies. Both federal Industry Minister [[Tony Clement]] and Ontario Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] suggested the CAW's initial deal was insufficient in cutting costs and the union had return to the bargaining table to make further concessions, in order to show that taxpayers' money is justified.

'''Electronic Case Filing System (ECFS)''' is an automated system developed in [[Tarrant County]], [[Texas]] that enables law enforcement agencies, criminal district attorney, county criminal courts, criminal district courts, and the defense bar to process and exchange information about criminal offenses.  ECFS software does not work on the Apple Mac platform.

== History ==

ECFS was conceived in November 2002 in [[Tarrant County]], [[Texas]]. Initially, the purpose of the system was to enable law enforcement agencies to submit offense reports to the criminal district attorney's office for possible prosecution. In July 2003, the Criminal District Attorney's accepted the first electronic case filing via ECFS.  Since that time, more than 100,000 cases have been filed in ECFS by the 47 Law Enforcement Agencies located in Tarrant County, Texas. ECFS was expanded in June 2004 to incorporate the Grand Jury function which is able to return Indictments to the Criminal District Courts on the same day that a True Bill is decided.

In January 2005, ECFS was extended to enable the Judges and their Court Staff to effectively manage the docket (case load) for each of the nine (9) Criminal District Courts. Since the implementation of ECFS, Tarrant County has been able to control the Jail population, despite a significant increase in the number of cases being filed. In August 2005, ECFS was extended to enable members of the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to browse and view defendant, offense, and evidence via ECFS. Through this process, defense attorneys are no longer required to visit the Criminal District Attorney's Office to view and copy file.

Since January 2006, the Criminal District Attorney's Office has been completely paperless and all Offense Reports are submitted via ECFS and made available to Law Enforcement Agencies, County and District Courts, and Defense Attorneys. In July 2006, ECFS was extended to allow criminal defendants to be masgistrated electronically.  This process also allows the Office of Attorney appointments to be notified that the defendant has requested that defense counsel be appointed which triggers a business process that captures financial information, facilitates a determination of indigency, and when appropriate appoints defense counsel.

In 2005, the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association, a non-profit charitable association, implemented its own software design to enable all attorney's, whether members of TCCDLA or not, to access the ECFS system.  The software only works on PCs and will not work on Apple's Mac platform. The process enables an attorney to access his or her case files from any computer on the World Wide Web, and is secure and reliable. TCCDLA has continuously revised its software process to enable access 24-7, with little down time. TCCDLA also installed computers in the Tarrant County Justice Center that allow subscribers to access files while in the courthouse. Storm's Edge Technologies is the computer software company that exclusively provides support and design of the TCCDLA ECFS access system.

}}The '''European Foundation for Management Development''' ('''EFMD''') is an international not-for-profit association, based in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=L'European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.groupeiam.com/index.php/accueil-efmd/72-international/organismes-internationaux-de-labellisation/100-l-european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://www.groupeiam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's largest network association in the field of management development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba-courses.com/efmd.htm |title=European Foundation for Management Development: EQUIS Accreditation: A Level of Quality |work=MBA Courses Worldwide |publisher=Sandringham Publishing Ltd |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has over 890 member organizations from [[academia]], business, public service and consultancy in 88 countries (as of September 2017). EFMD provides a forum for networking in [[management development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development|url=http://10times.com/organizers/european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://10times.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFMD operates the '''EFMD Quality Improvement System''' ([[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]]), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hayleys case study by INSEAD wins top award in Europe |location=Sri Lanka |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|The Daily Mirror]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/print/index.php/business/127-local/12150.html |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation also runs the EPAS accreditation system for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.unprme.org/about-prme/governance/efmd.php|journal=http://www.unprme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types of accreditation ==

While the [[EQUIS]] accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EPAS Accreditation EFMD Programme accreditation System (EPAS) |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/services-for-business-schools/epas-accreditation |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA ([[Association of MBAs]]) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of [[MBA]] programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP).

== Triple Accreditation ==

In business and management education, acquiring multiple accreditation by [[EQUIS]], [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] is often considered the "gold standard" because a business school must go to through a rigorous certification process by each of the three accreditation bodies. Schools that acquire all three are often referred to as having a [[Triple accreditation]] or Triple Crown accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Grandes écoles: les labels enfin décryptés|url=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/info/labels-accreditations-grandes-ecoles-enfin-decryptes.html|journal=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr|date = 13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EFMD activities ==

EFMD is the European partner in the [[China Europe International Business School]] ([[CEIBS]]), a joint venture with [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the [[European Commission]] and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
EFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[AACSB]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFMD organizes conferences and seminars around the world for management development industry and published the [http://globalfocusmagazine.com Global Focus magazine].

In 2009, EFMD received an EU grant worth €2.2m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2009 Annual Action Programme for Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/documents/aap/2009/af_aap_2009_dci-nsa_p2.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of Cuban companies by providing training to senior managers.

The '''feminine style of management''' is a [[management style]] generally characterized by more feminine quality [[soft skills]] and behaviors such as empathy, effective communication, and a generally more democratic or team-styled work environment. The style is a growing trend within businesses and is characterized by a form of [[transformational leadership]] style. The feminine style of management, although characterized by traits commonly labeled as [[feminine]], it is not a style of management that is only used by females; it is also a style which has been found beneficial for particular types of businesses and organizations.

==Historical development==

===Early 1900s===
Beginning with textile mills and the shoe-making industry of post-revolutionary America, the first real appearance of an explosion of women in a general workforce, whether at home or manufacturing, came at the turn of the century. By [[World War I]], many women were poised to join the workforce as a high population of men served in the war. As men returned from the war and a falling economy led to the [[Great Depression]], women suffered displacement. By [[World War II]] there was a similar growth of women in business that had been previously reserved for men. The combination of a better economy and a quickly changing standard of society norms, many women's roles and functions in business steadily increased following World II.

===1970s–1980s===
In the 1970s feminist authors denied or minimized the differences between men and women to establish that women had similar talents to men and should have equal labor opportunities. In [[Schutlz v. Wheaton Glass Co]]., a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled jobs held by men must be "substantially equal" but not "identical" to fall under the protection of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] and that it is therefefore illegal for employers to change the job titles of women workers in order to pay them less than men.

However, as the 1980s began, differences were more emphasized and noted as a means of progression due the management style differences that came of feminine values and ways of behaving, feeling, and thinking.&lt;ref name="Management Style-British Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|title=Desperately Seeking Differences: Is management style gendered?|journal=British Journal of Industrial Relations|date=September 1996|volume=34|pages=333–349|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.1996.tb00478.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2011-10-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–present===
In 1991, women represented 45% of all managerial positions.&lt;ref name="Business Encylopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Business|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/Val-Z/Women-in-Business.html|work=Encyclopedia of Business|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, although the feminine management style can be found being utilized throughout organizations internationally now, barriers to acceptance of this management style include stereotype and perceptions, mentoring and networking availability, [[workplace discrimination]], family related issues, as well as funding availability.&lt;ref name="Organizational Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Modaff|first=D.P|title=Organizational Communication: Foundations, challenges, and misunderstandings|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=978-0-205-79825-4|pages=255–273|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in female leaders is a result of changing theories and practices of [[leadership]].

==Gendered organizations==
Reasons a systematic [[theory]] of gender and organizations is necessary:&lt;ref name="Gendered organizations Acker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acker|first=Joan|title=Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations|journal=Gender and Society|date=June 1990|volume=4|pages=139–158|doi=10.1177/089124390004002002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The gender segregation of work, including divisions between paid and unpaid work, is partly created through organizational practices.
# Related to gender segregation, income and status inequality between women and men is also partly created in organizational processes; understanding these processes is necessary for understanding gender inequality.
# Organizations are one arena in which widely disseminated cultural images of gender are invented and reproduced. Knowledge of cultural productions is important for understanding gender construction.
# Some aspects of individual gender identity, perhaps particularly masculinity, are also products of organizational processes and pressures.
# An important feminist project is to make large-scale organizations more democratic and more supportive of humane goals.

===Gendering interaction processes===
In addition to the reasons that it is necessary to examine feminine styles of management within theories of gendered organizations, Acker adds, is because gendering occurs in at least five different interacting processes.&lt;ref name="Gendered organizations Acker" /&gt;

* First, the construction of divisions along lines of gender-[[division of labor]], of allowed behaviors, of locations in physical space, of power, including the institutionalized means of maintaining the divisions in the structures of labor markets, the family, the state.
* Second, the construction of [[symbols]] and images that explain, express, reinforce, or sometimes oppose those divisions.
* Third, interactions between women and men, women and women, men and men, including all those patterns that enact dominance and submission.
* Fourth, processes help to produce gendered components of individual [[Identity (social science)|identity]], which may include consciousness of the existence of the other three aspects of gender, such as, in organizations, choice of appropriate work, language use, clothing, and presentation of self as a gendered member of an organization.
* Finally, [[gender]] is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualizing social structures.

==Characteristics==

===Types of management===
Within the three main types of managerial styles, studies have examined differences in [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] styles. The first is the [[task management]] style, or how much a leader initiates, organizes, and/or defines work activities and processes. The second style,an [[interpersonal]] based style, which is a style where generally the leader builds morale, relationships, satisfaction, and commitment in the organization. Lastly, the third is the [[group decision making]] style, which is when the leader encourages a participative, democratic approach&lt;ref name="Business Encyclopedia" /&gt;

===Feminine style characteristics===
Some studies find differences between males' and females' task accomplishment styles and interpersonal styles. Males tended to be more task-oriented; females tended to be more relationship-oriented. These differences, however, have been observed only in men and women subjects of laboratory experiments, that is, people asked to speculate how they would behave if they were leaders. Management traditionally been male dominated and constructed in masculine terms. Present ideas involving femininity in management include transforming places of work into relation-oriented, flexible, and humane institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Due Billing|first=Yvonne|author2=Mats Alvesson| author-link= Mats Alvesson |title=Questioning the Notion of Feminine Leadership: A Critical Perspective on the Gender Labeling of Leadership|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=July 2000|volume=7|issue=3|pages=144–157|doi=10.1111/1468-0432.00103}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences disappear in studies where actual managers are compared: most conclude that women do not behave differently from men in the same or similar kind of leadership position. Moreover, experienced women managers show no differences in leadership abilities from experienced male managers. These women, in fact, are likely to more closely resemble their male counterparts in drive, skills, temperament, and competitiveness, than the average woman in the population.&lt;ref name="Business Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Leadership|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/For-Gol/Gender-and-Leadership.html|work=Reference for Business Encyclopedia|accessdate=10/02/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Cummings stated, ""The notion of what makes an effective leader is changing, and you will find both [traditionally defined] ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ components." &lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-masculine-and-feminine-sides-of-leadership-and-culture-perception-vs-reality/&lt;/ref&gt; In order for women to make an impact within an organization as an executive they need to be aware of their leadership styles and strengths.&lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Examples in research===
In 1990, Alice Eagly and Johnson conducted a study on gender and leadership and found results they later emphasized with supporting meta-analysis data.&lt;ref name="Eagly 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A|author2=Johnson, B.T.|title=Gender and leadership style: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1990|volume=108|pages=233–256|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.2.233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in 1992 and 1995, researchers Eagly and Johnson also conducted meta-analysis on the effectiveness and evaluation, respectively, of differing management styles. The results showed that the main difference in management styles in men and women were that women are more democratic, while men were found to generally be more autocratic, however, the studies show little evidence that would suggest males and females differ in their leadership effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Eagly 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A |author2=Makhijani, M.G. |author3=Klonsky, B.G.|title=Gender and the effectiveness of leaders: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1992|volume=111|pages=3–22|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagly 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A|author2=Karau, S. J.|author3=Makhijani, M. G.|title=Gender and the effectiveness of leaders: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1995|volume=117|pages=125–145|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.125|pmid=7870858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that women tend to be more focused on encouraging participation and involving their workforce in business decisions while men are more focused on encouraging performance and driving towards tangible production.

In 2003, a meta-analysis was conducted by Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and Van Engen that compared male and female managers on measures of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles; their findings emphasized the results of their previous study.The meta-analysis study showed that women were slightly more likely than men to exercise a transformational leadership style.&lt;ref name="Eagly, Johannesen, &amp; Van Engen 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A |author2=Johannesen-Schmidt, M.C. |author3=Van Engen, M.|title=Transformational, transactional, and laissezfaire leadership styles: A meta-analysis comparing women and men.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=108|pages=569–591|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a style of management that is likely to be used by coaches, teachers, and other individuals focused on developing subordinates. The transformational leadership encourages participation and creative problem solving. Eagly proposes that the transformational style of management is likely more advantageous for women to employ however. Men were shown to be more likely to critique their employees and be less interactive, in contrast to the women who utilized a more "hands-on" approach.

In contrast, research in the past few decades shows that these results are only averages. Men and Women do not show a significant difference in these management styles, only slight differences. Some men proved to use more feminine styles, while some women proved to use more masculine styles. Eagly states that,"the sex differences are small because the leader role itself carries a lot of weight in determining people's behavior.""

In 2005, a year-long study conducted by Caliper, a Princeton, New Jersey-based management consulting firm, and Aurora, a London-based organization that advances women, identified a number of characteristics that distinguish women leaders from men when it comes to qualities of leadership: Women leaders are more assertive and persuasive, have a stronger need to get things done and are more willing to take risks than male leaders....Women leaders were also found to be more empathetic and flexible, as well as stronger in interpersonal skills than their male counterparts....enabling them to read situations accurately and take information in from all sides....These women leaders are able to bring others around to their point of view....because they genuinely understand and care about where others are coming from....so that the people they are leading feel more understood, supported and valued.  These findings were summarized into four specific statements about women's leadership qualities: (1) Women leaders are more persuasive than their male counterparts, (2) When feeling the sting of rejection, women leaders learn from adversity and carry on with an "I'll show you" attitude, (3) Women leaders demonstrate an inclusive, team-building leadership style of problem solving and decision making, (4) Women leaders are more likely to ignore rules and take risks.&lt;ref name="Lowen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowen|first=Linda|title=Qualities of Women Leaders: The Unique Leadership Characteristics of Women|url=http://womensissues.about.com/od/intheworkplace/a/WomenLeaders.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=4/8/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BET's CEO, Debra Lee, explains that it is easy to generalize the differences in gender leadership styles as "women do it this way, and men do it that way."  Instead of simply generalizing, Debra Lee asserts that it is important to discuss these differences so that women don't feel uncomfortable managing differently from men.  During this interview she further states that we should encourage young women to climb the corporate ladder.  Lee explained that her hardest lesson was learning to follow her gut when others challenged it, but that lesson has truly paid off.  She insists that we encourage young women to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Lillian|title=On women and Washington: A leadership interview with BET's Debra Lee|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/on-women-and-washington-a-leadership-interview-with-bets-debra-lee/2012/03/20/gIQAoo5GSS_story.html|accessdate=4/8/12|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=3/21/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's vital for women to embrace these differences. During a 2006 speech given by Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, the World YWCA Secretary General, she explained that the attitudes toward leadership are changing and what women offer is essential.  She stated: "Domination as a leadership style is becoming less and less popular. There is a new growing appreciation of....those traits that women use to keep families together and to organize volunteers to unite and make change in the shared life of communities. These newly admired leadership qualities of shared leadership; nurturance and doing good for others are today not only sought after but also indeed needed to make a difference in the world....A feminine way of leading includes helping the world to understand and be principled about values that really matter."&lt;ref name="Lowen"/&gt;

===Recent examples in global society===
The feminine style of management embodying organizational progression, more and more female leaders are found within society today. In addition to the thousands of women who now receive graduate and doctoral degrees, many hold managerial positions within companies, and females hold 45% of all managerial posts.&lt;ref name="Sharpe Businessweek"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharpe |first=Rochelle |title=As Leaders, Women Rule |url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708145.htm |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=20 November 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128040043/http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708145.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many nonprofit organizations take a feminine style of leadership approach when handling employees.  These particular organizations tend to encourage participation among group members, show flexibility, and maintain a non-hierarchical work environment.&lt;ref&gt;Questioning the notion of feminine leadership: a critical perspective on the gender labeling of leadership, Yvonne Due Billing &amp; Mats Alvesson, Gender, Work and Organization, 7(3), 2000, pp 144-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders that take on this style tend to show genuine care and understanding towards their employees. The empathy they have for others enables their employees to feel as though they are recognized and valued within the organization. These leaders are also known for their communication skills and tendency to listen to multiple perspective before making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;"Women Leaders Study: The Qualities That Distinguish Women Leaders." Caliperonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Their desire to use team-building activities creates a sense of community within organizations, which in turn helps to meet overall goals.&lt;ref&gt;Kanyoro, Musimbi. "Challenges to Women's Leadership." Speech in honor of YWCA of Salt Lake centennial celebration. 13 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a company using team-building, genuinely understand its employees needs, and embracing femininity is Mary Kay Cosmetics. This company strives to treat employees as individuals and help them reach their personal goals. When employees meet particular sales goals they are rewarded with things they desire, such as pink Cadillacs and diamonds. These actions show employees that they are valued and understood, which leads to a positive corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;Knowledge@Wharton (2005). [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1287 "The 'Masculine' and 'Feminine' Sides of Leadership and Culture: Perception vs. Reality."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung-Joo Kim, chairman and chief executive of luxury-goods company MCM Worldwide, is an example of a woman using the feminine style of management to help successfully run a company.Kim's sensitivity and openness towards employees gives her an advantage over other luxury-good corporations. Kim has to find a balance between her sensitivity and still maintaining order and a level of toughness. Kim grew up in a patriarchal Korean household and her experiences led her to strive to prove to others that femininity and power are not mutually exclusive and it is quite possible to be a nurturing woman and still run a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;Covel, Simona. (2008). [https://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2008/06/09/the-benefits-of-a-feminine-leadership-style/ "The Benefits of a 'Feminine' Leadership Style."]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Esther Wachs Book, "A new breed of leader is emerging, and that breed is female."  She contends that women, such as Meg Whitman of eBay and Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner, succeed because they embody seven uniquely female abilities: they can sell their visions; they are not afraid to reinvent the rules; they are focused on achievement; they show courage under fire; they turn challenges into opportunities; they are aware of customer preferences; and they maximize what Book calls "high touch" in an era of high tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are women natural leaders, and men...the opposite?|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=265|publisher=Knowledge@Wharton|accessdate=4/8/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Fourdrinier.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henry Fourdrinier]]
'''Henry Fourdrinier''' (11 February 1766 – 3 September 1854) was a [[British people|British]] paper-making entrepreneur.

He was born in 1766, the son of a paper maker and stationer, and grandson of the engraver [[Paul Fourdrinier]], 1698-1758, sometimes mistakenly called [[Pierre Fourdrinier]]. With his brother, [[Sealy Fourdrinier|Sealy]], he commissioned the development of the [[Fourdrinier machine]], a [[papermaking]] machine that produced continuous rolls of paper. The machine is an industrialised version of the historical hand paper-making method, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of printing and writing materials. 

A [[patent]] was granted on 24 July 1806,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9k0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327 ''Repertory of Patent Inventions''. London, 1807]&lt;/ref&gt; for a machine that could make a long continuous web of paper. This had the dual advantage of considerably higher productivity plus production in roll form, for applications such as wallpaper printing. The range of cut paper sizes was also extended as it was not limited by the frame or [[deckle]] size of hand made paper.

[[File:Papermaking machine at a paper mill near Pensacola.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Large Fourdrinier-style paper-making machine. A row of heated drums dry out the paper, which enters the machine as wet pulp.&lt;br&gt;Large rolls are usually sliced into a number of thin rolls, which can feed continuous presses (e.g. newspapers) or be cut into separate sheets.]]

The invention cost £60000, and caused the brothers to go bankrupt. Due to various laws, it was difficult to protect the patent on the machine, and the new system was widely adopted but with no benefit to the inventors. 

In 1814, two machines were made in [[Petergof|Peterhof]], Russia, by order of the Russian emperor on the condition £700 would be paid to Fourdrinier every year for ten years &amp;mdash; but, despite petitioning [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]], no money was ever paid. In 1839, a petition was brought before parliament, and in 1840, £7000 was paid to Fourdrinier and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fourdrinier, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourdrinier died in 1854, at the age of 88.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5064">The modern '''Australian native food industry''', also called the '''[[bushfood]] industry''', had its initial beginnings in the 1970s and early 1980s, when regional enthusiasts and researchers started to target local native species. In the mid 1970s Brian Powell recognized the commercial potential of [[Santalum acuminatum|quangdong]] fruit and began its cultivation in orchards. Following this, the [[CSIRO]] became involved in quangdong research.

In the late 1970s, [[Peter Hardwick]] began investigating subtropical native plants suitable for commercial cropping, selecting fruit species like [[riberry]], [[Davidsonia]], and later leaf-spices, like [[lemon myrtle]], [[Aniseed myrtle]], and [[Dorrigo Pepper]]. Hardwick started targeting strong flavoured species suitable for processing, which later became the main industry strategy. In the 1980s, Hardwick worked in the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, where he met essential oils researcher, Dr Ian Southwell. Southwell played a significant role in providing the [[essential oil]] profiles of many of the most popular native spices.

In 1983. the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, headed by [[Jennie Brand-Miller]], undertook a nutritional analysis programme analyzing bushfood for Aboriginal health. [[Vic Cherikoff]], a member of the Human Nutrition Unit team, started-up a wholesale distribution company marketing native Australian ingredients. Cherikoff played a vital role in linking-up the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and regional bushfood research with the restaurant and food processing industry. Cherikoff also contributed to Jennifer Isaacs' book, ''Bush Food'' and authored ''The Bushfood Handbook'' and ''Uniquely Australian, A wildfood cookbook'' which publicly defined the emerging industry.

In the mid-1980s several Australian theme restaurants opened-up in [[Sydney]]. This included ''Rowntrees The Australian Restaurant'', run by Chef [[Jean-Paul Bruneteau]] and Jenny Dowling. In 1996, Bruneteau, Dowling and Cherikoff opened a second restaurant, ''Riberries – Taste Australia''. ''Edna’s Table'' restaurant also opened-up and was run by brother and sister team, Chef Raymond Kersh and Jennice Kersh. The ''Red Ochre Grill'' in [[Adelaide]] opened-up in the early 1990s, with Andrew Fielke as its chef. Fielke also co-founded a production company, ''Australian Native Produce Industries'' (ANPI).

Value-added production emerged in the late 1980s with products marketed via mainstream retailers. Ian and Juleigh Robbins, established a line of processed sauces, jams and dried spice products through ''Robin's Foods Pty Ltd''. Boutique value-added production − such as jams, sauces and beverages – has become increasingly significant in the regional development of native foods.

Small-scale trial commercial production of native food plants started to occur in the late 1980s, especially in Northern New South Wales. In 1994 the [[Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation]] and [[Greening Australia]] co-sponsored a conference on growing bushfoods near Lismore. The [[2000 Olympic Games]], in Sydney, were targeted by the developing industry as an event for promoting native foods.

Various regionally based industry associations were formed to represent growers in a national process. Government agencies have become increasingly involved with new native crop development. [[CSIRO]] researcher, Dr Stephen Sykes,  developed a range of native ''Citrus'' hybrids which became available through ANPI.

Since 2000 the industry has continued to consolidate, with a growing overseas market for produce and greater refinement in production methods to supply the demand. Some new products have been introduced, including [[Finger Lime]], mintbush and ''[[Eucalyptus olida]]''. However, while the rate of introduction of new native food-plant species has slowed since the early period of the industries conception in the 1980s, the marketing of herb and spice blends, fruit mixtures and functional extracts has grown, potentially leading the industry into new and larger market segments.

Crops initially associated mainly with bushfood, such as [[lemon myrtle]], have since broadened to become associated with [[essential oils]] and [[cosmetics]].

{{Sociology}}
'''Industrial sociology''', until recently a crucial research area within the field of '''sociology of work''', examines
{{quote|the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions.{{sfn|Watson|2008|p=392}}}}

== Labour process theory ==
One branch of industrial sociology is [[labour process theory]] (LPT). In 1974, [[Harry Braverman]] wrote ''[[Labor and Monopoly Capital]]'', which provided a critical analysis of scientific management. This book analysed [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic production|productive]] relations from a [[Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Meiksins |first=Peter |year=1994 |title='Labor and Monopoly Capital' for the 1990s: A Review and Critique of the Labor Process Debate |magazine=Monthly Review |volume=46 |issue=6 |location=New York |issn=0027-0520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organizations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinization of the worker. The [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.

Braverman demonstrated several mechanisms of control in both the factory [[blue-collar]] and clerical [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] labour force.
His key contribution is his "[[deskilling]]" thesis.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Braverman argued that capitalist owners and managers were incessantly driven to deskill the labour force to lower production costs{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} and ensure higher productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Deskilled labour is cheap and above all easy to control due to the workers' lack of direct engagement in the production process.{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} In turn work becomes intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling; the lack of capitalist reliance on human skill reduces the need of employers to reward workers in anything but a minimal economic way.

Braverman's contribution to the sociology of work and industry (i.e., industrial sociology) has been important and his theories of the labour process continue to inform teaching and research.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Braverman's thesis has, however, been contested, {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=notably}} by Andrew Freidman in his work ''Industry and Labour'' (1977).{{sfn|Friedman|1977|pp=80–82}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} In it, Freidman suggests that whilst the direct control of labour is beneficial for the capitalist under certain circumstances, a degree of "responsible autonomy" can be granted to unionized or "core" workers, in order to harness their skill under controlled conditions. Also, Richard Edwards showed in 1979 that although hierarchy in organizations has remained constant, additional forms of control (such as technical control via email monitoring, call monitoring; bureaucratic control via procedures for leave, sickness etc.) has been added to gain the interests of the capitalist class versus the workers. Duncan Gallie{{sfn|Gallie|1991}} has shown how important it is to approach the question of skill from a social class perspective. In his study, the majority of non-manual, intermediate and skilled manual workers believed that their work had come to demand a higher level of skill, but the majority of manual worker felt that the responsibility and skill needed in their work had either remained constant or declined. This means that Braverman's claims can't be applied to all social classes.

The notion the particular type of technology workers were exposed to shapes their experience was most forcefully argued in a classic study by [[Robert Blauner]].{{sfn|Blauner|1964}} He argued that some work is alienating more than other types because of the different technologies workers use.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Alienation, to Blauner, has four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement.{{sfn|Blauner|1964|pp=15–16}} Individuals are powerless when they can't control their own actions or conditions of work; work is meaningless when it gives employees little or no sense of value, interest or worth; work is isolating when workers cannot identify with their workplace; and work is self-estranging when, at the subjective level, the worker has no sense of involvement in the job.

Blauner's claims however fail to recognize that the same technology can be experienced in a variety of ways. Studies have shown that cultural differences with regard to management–union relations, levels of hierarchical control, and reward and [[performance appraisal]] policies mean that the experience of the same kind of work can vary considerably between countries and firms.{{sfn|Jenkins|1994}} The individualization of work and the need for workers to have more flexible skills in order to respond to technological changes means that Blauner's characterization of work experience is no longer valid. Additionally, workers today may work in teams to alleviate workers' sense of alienation, since they are involved in the entire process, rather than just a small part of it. In conclusion, automative technologies and computerized work systems have typically enhanced workers' job satisfaction and skill deployment in the better-paid, secure public and private sector jobs. But, in more non-skilled manual work, they have just perpetuated job dissatisfaction, especially for the many women involved in this type of work.

==History==
Nien-Ling Wacker founded Compulink Management Center Inc., a custom software development company, in 1974. By the early 1980s, Wacker had identified an emerging need among her clients for an electronic document repository that would provide both secure storage and instant retrieval by any word or phrase in the document.

The concept for a [[Personal computer|PC]]-based [[document management]] system began in 1981 when a client, a large Japanese auto manufacturer, required litigation support for a large volume of documents.{{citation needed
|date=July 2017}}  At the time, paralegals had to wade through thousands of pages of depositions, entering [[Index term|keyword]]s into a database.  Attorneys were limited to searching on keywords to find relevant testimony.&lt;ref name="AIIM"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.aiim.org/article-docrep.asp?ID=25296
|last=Duhon
|first=Bryant
|publisher=AIIM e-doc magazine
|title=One-on-One With Nien-Ling Wacker
|date=November 12, 2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nien-Ling Wacker realized that if a [[full-text index]] of every page were available, the search capabilities would be greatly enhanced, and the amount of physical labor required to index the documents would decrease substantially.  With the release of [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] drives that cost "only" $200 for 200MB of diskspace, the conceived system could be made cost effective.&lt;ref name="AIIM" /&gt;

The first version of Laserfiche was released in 1987, becoming the first [[DOS]]-based [[document imaging]] system in the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news

In 2002, Laserfiche 6 marked the company’s first foray into MSSQL{{Clarify|date=November 2013}}-based document management. That year, the company also introduced Quick Fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Fields|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Quick-Fields|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an automated document processing module, and WebLink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weblink|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/WebLink|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided read-only, Web-based access to documents stored in Laserfiche.

In 2004, Laserfiche 7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Plans Continued Growth with Release of Version 7|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2004/08/31/laserfiche-plans-continued-growth-with-run-smarter-market-positioning-and-release-of-its-version-7|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the company’s first offering for Oracle users.

In early 2008, the company released Laserfiche 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Generation Laserfiche 8|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2008/01/14/next-generation-laserfiche-8-optimizes-infrastructure-integrating-content-with-business-processes|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a re-written workflow engine and integration with Microsoft SharePoint. In August 2008, the company launched Laserfiche Rio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Rio|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2008/08/08/rio|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enterprise content management offering with unlimited servers, named user licensing and bundled functionality including content management, business process management and a thin-client interface called Web Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Access|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Web-Access|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Laserfiche opened an international office in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Hong Kong|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2009/10/26/laserfiche-opens-new-international-office-in-hong-kong|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a separate company Laserfiche International.

In 2010, Laserfiche filed a lawsuit against [[SAP AG|SAP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche files lawsuit against SAP|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2010/10/25/laserfiche-files-lawsuit-against-sap-for-trademark-infringement|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for trademark infringement over the disputed trademark phrase "Run Smarter". In 2011, Laserfiche announced that the litigation had been settled amicably and involved a license of the “Run Smarter” trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche &amp; SAP Lawsuit Resolution|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2011/09/20/laserfiche-resolves-trademark-infringement-lawsuit-against-sap|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Laserfiche was listed as a Champion in Info-Tech Research Group’s Enterprise Content Management (ECM) for Process Workers Vendor Landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Identified as champion by Info-Tech Research Group|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2011/12/28/laserfiche-identified-as-a-champion-by-info-tech-research-group|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Info-Tech, “Laserfiche is a stalwart that is exploiting the new capabilities of emerging technology.

In 2012, Laserfiche released Laserfiche Mobile for [[iPad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Mobile for iPad|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Laserfiche-Mobile-iPad|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an app that extends governance, risk and compliance standards to the iPad.

Laserfiche said it was profitable since 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buyers Lab Report|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/pdf/document/1210111|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing at what Wacker describes as a managed pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optimistic &amp; Positive Environment at Laserfiche|url=http://www.sbnonline.com/2007/09/a-popular-culture-how-nien-ling-wacker-fosters-an-optimistic-and-productive-environment-at-laserfiche/|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of brand name condiments'''. A [[condiment]] is a supplemental food, such as a [[sauce]], that is added to some foods to impart a particular flavor, enhance its flavor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condiment | title=Merriam-Webster: Definition of condiment | publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary | accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in some [[cultures]], to complement the dish.

The '''Medal "For the Tapping of the Subsoil and Expansion of the Petrochemical Complex of Western Siberia"''' ({{lang-ru|Медаль «За освоение недр и развитие нефтегазового комплекса Западной Сибири»}}) was a civilian award of the [[Soviet Union]] established on July 28, 1978 by Decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]]&lt;ref name="siberianoil"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of July 28, 1978 | publisher = Legal Library of the USSR | date= 1978-07-28 | url = http://www.libussr.ru/doc_ussr/usr_9718.htm | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognise three years of dedicated work in developing the [[petrochemical industry|Petrochemical Complex]] of [[Western Siberia]].

==Medal statute==
The Medal "For the Tapping of the Subsoil and Expansion of the Petrochemical Complex of Western Siberia" was awarded to active members in the underground exploration and development of the oil and gas complex of Western Siberia for selfless labour in the identification, exploration and development of the mining and industrial processing of oil and gas, for work in construction, in manufacturing, in housing and other civilian facilities, in building highways, in electricity, transport or other services to the oil and gas industries, as well as to employees of scientific, research or design organizations, of institutions and organizations, of the service sector, Party, Soviet, trade union or [[Komsomol]] organs of the oil and gas industry, who produced conscientious work and contributed to the development of the petrochemical complex of Western Siberia over a period of at least three years.&lt;ref name="siberianoil"/&gt;

Recommendations for award of the Medal "For the Tapping of the Subsoil and Expansion of the Petrochemical Complex of Western Siberia" were made by the administrative heads of enterprises, institutions, organizations, party, trade union or Komsomol organizations or labour collectives and the executive committees of the District or City Council of People's Deputies.  The names of the potential recipients were then forwarded to the various ministries and agencies overseeing the different companies and organisations which were working in the development of the petrochemical complex of Western Siberia for approval.  The names of the recipients was then forwarded to the executive committees of the [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]] or [[Tomsk Oblast|Tomsk oblasts]] Soviets of People's Deputies for award on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the [[USSR]] and of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the [[RSFSR]].&lt;ref name="siberianoil"/&gt;
  
The Medal "For the Tapping of the Subsoil and Expansion of the Petrochemical Complex of Western Siberia" was worn on the left side of the chest and in the presence of other medals of the USSR, immediately after the [[Medal "For Transforming the Non-Black Earth of the RSFSR"]]. If worn in the presence of awards of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.&lt;ref name="decree1099"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 7, 2010 No 1099 | publisher = Russian Gazette | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://www.rg.ru/2010/09/15/nagrady-dok.html | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each medal came with an attestation of award, this attestation came in the form of a small 8&amp;nbsp;cm by 11&amp;nbsp;cm cardboard booklet bearing the award's name, the recipient's particulars and an official stamp and signature on the inside.&lt;ref name="siberianoil"/&gt;

==Medal description==
The Medal "For the Tapping of the Subsoil and Expansion of the Petrochemical Complex of Western Siberia" was a 32&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter circular brass medal.  On its [[obverse]], in the right half, the relief image of a sickle over a vertical hammer, in the background, the relief images of two oil rigs at center, two gas tanks at left, a tractor and piping at lower center, at the bottom a small relief five pointed star, along the medal circumference, the relief inscription "For the tapping of the subsoil and expansion of the petrochemical complex of Western Siberia" ({{lang-ru|«За освоение недр и развитие нефтегазового комплекса Западной Сибири»}}).  On the reverse, in the central upper half, a relief five pointed star emitting rays from between its arms forming an inversed pentagon, superimposed over the star, the relief inscription "USSR" ({{lang-ru|«СССР»}}), at the bottom, crossed laurel and oak branches.&lt;ref name="siberianoil"/&gt;

The Medal "For the Tapping of the Subsoil and Expansion of the Petrochemical Complex of Western Siberia" was secured to a standard Soviet pentagonal mount by a ring through the medal suspension loop. The mount was covered by a 24&amp;nbsp;mm wide overlapping green silk [[moiré]] ribbon with a 6&amp;nbsp;mm wide central blue stripe bordered on both sides by 2&amp;nbsp;mm black stripes themselves bordered on the outside by 1&amp;nbsp;mm wide white stripes.&lt;ref name="siberianoil"/&gt;

The '''world's most livable cities''' is an informal name given to any [[list of cities]] as they rank on an annual survey of [[standard of living|living conditions]]. Regions with cities commonly ranked in the top 50 include the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="MercerSurvey2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=2015 quality of living survey | work=Mercer | date=4 March 2015 |url=http://www.uk.mercer.com/newsroom/2015-quality-of-living-survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three examples of such surveys are [[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'s "Most Liveable Cities Index", the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s "Global Liveability Ranking", and "[[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] Quality of Living Survey". Numbeo has the largest statistics and survey data based on cities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ Numbeo official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Livability rankings may be used by employers assigning hardship allowances as part of job relocation.

==The EIU's Global Liveability Ranking==
[[File:Façade nord château Schönbrunn Vienna.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|Vienna tops the Economist Intelligence Unit Ranking in 2018, replacing Melbourne which held top rank from 2011-2017]]
{{main article|Global Liveability Ranking}}

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s (EIU) publishes an annual Global Liveability Ranking, which ranks 140 cities for their urban [[quality of life]] based on assessments of their stability, [[healthcare]], culture and environment, [[education]] and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/topic/liveability|title=Global Liveability Ranking 2016|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne]], Australia, had been ranked by the EIU as the world's most livable city for seven years in a row, from 2011 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-16/melbourne-named-worlds-most-liveable-city-for-seventh-year/8812196|title=World's most liveable city: Melbourne takes top spot for seventh year running|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 August 2017|author=Stephanie Chalkley-Rhoden|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2010, [[Vancouver]], Canada, was ranked the EIU's most livable city, with Melbourne sharing first place in the inaugural 2002 report. Vancouver has ranked third since 2015, while [[Vienna]], Austria, ranked second until 2018 when it ranked first.

The Syrian capital, [[Damascus]], was ranked the least livable city of the 140 assessed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A summary of the liveability ranking and overview|last=Economist Intelligence Unit|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EIU also publishes a Worldwide Cost of Living Survey that compares the cost of living in a range of global cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/topic/worldwide-cost-of-living|title=The Worldwide Cost of Living Survey|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mercer's Quality of Living Ranking==

{{main article|Mercer Quality of Living Survey}}

American global [[human resources]] and related [[financial services]] consulting firm [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting|Mercer]] annually releases its [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]], comparing 221 cities based on 39 criteria. New York City is given a baseline score of 100 and other cities are rated in comparison. Important criteria are [[safety]], [[education]], [[hygiene]], [[health care]], [[culture]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[recreation]], political-economic stability, [[public transport]] and access to goods and services. The list is intended to help [[multinational companies]] decide where to open offices or plants, and how much to pay employees. For nine consecutive years (2009–2017), Mercer ranked [[Austria]]'s capital [[Vienna]] first in its annual "Quality of Living" survey, a title the city still held in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monocle|title=Quality of Live Survey 2015|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/the-monocle-quality-of-life-survey-2015/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=24 June 2015}}[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle's]] 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality of Life Survey 2012|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/The-Monocle-Quality-of-Life-Survey-2012/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocle's top 25 cities for 2011, on businessinsider.com|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/monocle-quality-of-life-2011-6?op=1|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocle's 2011 "Quality of LIfe" summary|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/Most-liveable-city-Helsinki/|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Magazine-Articles/08-Vienna/ |title=08 Vienna |publisher=Monocle.com |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monocle's Quality of Life Survey==
[[File:Stadtbild_München.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Munich]] was ranked highest by ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' in 2018]]

Since 2006, the lifestyle magazine ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' has published an annual list of livable cities. The list in 2008 was named "The Most Liveable Cities Index" and presented 25 top locations for [[quality of life]].

Important criteria in this survey are safety/crime, international connectivity, climate/sunshine, quality of architecture, public transport, tolerance, environmental issues and access to nature, urban design, business conditions, pro-active policy developments and medical care.

The 2018 Monocle Survey determined the world's most livable city was [[Munich]], followed by [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]] and [[Zurich]]. A total of four [[German cities]] were on the list of the 25 most livable cities, 15 out of the 25 were [[Europe|European]], 3 each from [[Japan]] and [[Australia]], and one from [[North America]] ([[Vancouver]]). No cities from [[South America]], [[South Asia]], or [[Africa]] made it into the list.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbes|forbes.com]] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#35c5a3bd6153 Munich Named The Most Livable City In The World] Published: 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OLAP Cube.svg|thumb|An example of an OLAP cube]]

In database engineering in computing, '''OLAP cube''' is a term that typically refers to a multi-dimensional [[array data structure|array]] of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Gray, Jim |author2=Bosworth, Adam | author3=Layman, Andrew | author4=Pirahesh, Hamid |title=Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By, Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals | booktitle=Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) | year=1996 | pages=152–159 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/492099/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OLAP'' is an acronym for '''[[online analytical processing]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-online-analytical-processing-olap-15d2cdde-f70b-4277-b009-ed732b75fdd6 |title=Overview of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) |publisher=support.office.com |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights. The term ''cube'' here refers to a multi-dimensional
dataset, which is also sometimes called a [[hypercube]] if the number of dimensions is greater than 3.

== Terminology ==
A cube can be considered a multi-dimensional generalization of a two- or three-dimensional [[spreadsheet]].  For example, a company might wish to summarize financial data by product, by time-period, and by city to compare actual and budget expenses.  Product, time, city and scenario (actual and budget) are the data's dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.653 | title=Cybertec releases OLAP cubes for PostgreSQL | publisher=PostgreSQL | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cube'' is a shorthand for ''multidimensional dataset'', given that data can have an arbitrary number of ''[[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]''. The term [[hypercube]] is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. A cube is not a "cube" in the strict mathematical sense, as all the sides are not necessarily equal. But this term is used widely.

''Slice'' is a term for a dimension which is held constant for all cells so that multi-dimensional information can be shown in a two-dimensional physical space of a [[spreadsheet]] or [[pivot table]].

Each cell of the cube holds a number that represents some ''measure'' of the business, such as sales, profits, expenses, budget and forecast.

OLAP data is typically stored in a [[star schema]] or [[snowflake schema]] in a [[relational database|relational]] [[data warehouse]] or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the records in the [[fact table]] and dimensions are derived from the [[dimension table]]s.

== Hierarchy ==
The elements of a dimension can be organized as a [[hierarchy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/awcourse/oracle/server.920/a96520/glossary.htm#432038 | title=Oracle9i Data Warehousing Guide hierarchy | publisher=Lorentz Center | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of parent-child relationships, typically where a parent member summarizes its children. Parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.olapcouncil.org/research/glossaryly.htm | title=OLAP and OLAP Server Definitions | publisher=The OLAP Council | year=1995 | accessdate=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, May 2005's parent is Second Quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of Year 2005.  Similarly cities are the children of regions; products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure.

== Operations ==
Conceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis. Aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt; The user-initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively, through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down/up is sometimes called "slice and dice".  Common operations include slice and dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot.

[[File:OLAP slicing.png|thumb|OLAP slicing|350x350px]]
''Slice'' is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt; The picture shows a slicing operation: The sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2005 and 2006 are "sliced" out of the data cube.

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP dicing.png|thumb|OLAP dicing|350x350px]]
''Dice'': The dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/courses/cmput690/glossary.html | title=Glossary of Data Mining Terms | publisher=University of Alberta | year=1999 | accessdate=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture shows a dicing operation: The new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories, the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before.

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP drill up&amp;down.png|thumb|alt=OLAP-functionalities|OLAP Drill-up and drill-down|350x350px]]
''Drill Down/Up'' allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down).&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;
The picture shows a drill-down operation: The analyst moves from the summary category "Outdoor-Schutzausrüstung" to see the sales figures for the individual products.

{{Clear}}
''Roll-up'': A roll-up involves summarizing the data along a dimension. The summarization rule might be computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as "profit = sales - expenses".&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP pivoting.png|thumb|OLAP pivoting|350x350px]]
''[[Pivot table|Pivot]]'' allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces. For example, cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter. Pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/multidimensional-views?cat=technology | title=Computer Encyclopedia: multidimensional views |publisher=Answers.com | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture shows a pivoting operation: The whole cube is rotated, giving another perspective on the data.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; an abstract representation of a [[projection (relational algebra)|projection]] of an [[RDBMS]] relation. Given a [[relation (database)|relation]] of order ''N'', consider a projection that subtends ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' as the key and ''W'' as the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]] [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]. Characterizing this as a [[function (mathematics)|function]],

:''f'' : (''X'',''Y'',''Z'') → ''W'',

the attributes ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' correspond to the axes of the cube, while the ''W'' value corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube.

Insofar as two-dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize three dimensions, it is more practical to project "slices" of the data cube (we say ''project'' in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction, not in the [[SQL]] sense, although the two are conceptually similar),

:''g'' : (''X'',''Y'') → ''W''

which may suppress a primary key, but still have some semantic significance, perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given ''Z'' value of interest.

The motivation&lt;ref name=DataCubeGray1995/&gt; behind [[OLAP]] displays harks back to the ''cross-tabbed report'' paradigm of 1980s [[DBMS]]. The resulting spreadsheet-style display, where values of ''X'' populate row $1; values of ''Y'' populate column $A; and values of ''g'' : ( ''X'', ''Y'' ) → ''W'' populate the individual cells "southeast of" $B2, so to speak, $B2 itself included.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3683">In [[financial accounting]], '''operating cash flow''' (OCF), '''cash flow provided by operations''', '''cash flow from operating activities''' (CFO) or '''free cash flow from operations''' (FCFO), refers to the amount of [[cash]] a [[company]] generates from the [[revenue]]s it brings in, excluding [[cost]]s associated with long-term [[investment]] on [[Financial capital|capital]] items or investment in [[securities]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephen, Randolf Westerfield and Bradford Jordan '''Fundamentals of Corporate Finance'''&lt;/ref&gt; The International Financial Reporting Standards defines operating cash flow as cash generated from operations less [[tax]]ation and [[interest]] paid, [[investment]] income received and less [[dividend]]s paid gives rise to operating cash flows.&lt;ref&gt;'''International Accounting Standards 7, Cash Flow Statements (January 2007)'''&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate cash generated from operations, one must calculate cash generated from customers and cash paid to suppliers. The difference between the two reflects cash generated from operations.

Cash generated from ''operating'' customers
* revenue as reported
* - increase (decrease) in [[''operating'' accounts receivable|''operating'' trade receivables]] (1)
* - investment income (Profit on asset Sales, disclosed separately in Investment Cash Flow)
* - other income that is non cash and/or non sales related

Cash paid to ''operating'' suppliers
* [[cost of goods sold|costs of sales]]- Stock Variation = Purchase of goods. (2)
* + all other expenses
* - increase (decrease) in [[''operating'' accounts payable|''operating'' trade payables]] (1)
* - non cash expense items such as [[depreciation]], provisioning, impairments, [[bad debt]]s, etc.
* - financing expenses (disclosed separately in Finance Cash Flow)

(1): ''operating'':  Variations of Assets Suppliers and Clients accounts will be disclosed in the Financial Cash Flow

(2): Cost of Sales = Stock Out for sales. It is Cash Neutral. Cost of Sales - Stock Variation = Stock out - (Stock out - Stock In)= Stock In = Purchase of goods: Cash Out

==Operating Cash Flow vs. Net Income, EBIT, and EBITDA==
Interest is an operating flow. Since it adjusts for liabilities, receivables, and depreciation, operating cash flow is a more accurate measure of how much cash a company has generated (or used) than traditional measures of profitability such as [[net income]] or [[Earnings before interest and taxes|EBIT]]. For example, a company with numerous fixed assets on its books (e.g. factories, machinery, etc.) would likely have decreased [[net income]] due to [[depreciation]]; however, as depreciation is a non-cash expense&lt;ref&gt;[[wikinvest:depreciation|Definition of depreciation via Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt; the operating cash flow would provide a more accurate picture of the company's current cash holdings than the artificially low net income.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikinvest:Operating Cash Flow|Definition of OCF via Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ([[EBITDA]]) is a non-[[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] metric that can be used to evaluate a company's profitability based on net working capital. The difference between EBITDA and OCF would then reflect how the entity finances its net working capital in the short term. OCF is not a measure of free cash flow and the effect of investment activities would need to be considered to arrive at the free cash flow of the entity.

'''Organising''' is a systematic process of structuring, integrating, co-ordinating task goals, and activities to resources in order to attain objectives.

==History==
The [[information organization|organizing of information]] could be seen since humans began to [[write]]. Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history, but also supports the communication of history. Recording ideas in a written text, as opposed to verbally communicating with someone, and more specifically cataloging ideas and thoughts, is also an attempt to organize information.

[[Science book]]s are notable by their organization of a specific subject.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Encyclopedia]]s usually organize subjects into a single place, for faster [[index (publishing)|indexing]] and seeking of meanings.

== Characteristics ==
The following are the important characteristics of organization.

*'''Specialization and division of work.''' The entire philosophy of organization is centered on the concepts of [[specialization of work|specialization]] and [[division of work]]. The division of work is assigning responsibility for each organizational component to a specific individual or group thereof. It becomes specialization when the responsibility for a specific task lies with a designated expert in that field. The efforts of the operatives are coordinated to allow the process at hand to function correctly. Certain operatives occupy positions of [[management]] at various points in the process to ensure coordination.
*'''Orientation towards goals.''' Every organization has its own purposes and objectives. Organizing is the function employed to achieve the overall goals of the organization. Organization harmonizes the individual goals of the employees with overall objectives of the firm.
*'''Composition of individuals and groups.''' Individuals form a group and the groups form an organization. Thus, organization is the composition of individual and groups. Individuals are grouped into departments and their work is coordinated and directed towards organizational goals.
*'''Continuity.''' An organization is a group of people with a defined relationship in which they work together to achieve the goals of that organization. This relationship does not come to end after completing each task. Organization is a never ending process.
*'"FLEXIBILITY.'" The organising process should be flexible so that any change can be incorporated. It ensures the ability to adapt and adjust the activities in response to the change taking place in the external environment. The programmes, policies and strategies can be changed as and when required if the provision for flexibility is made in the organising process.

== Purpose ==

*'''Helps to achieve organizational goal.''' Organization is employed to achieve the overall objectives of business firms. Organization focuses attention of individuals objectives towards overall objectives.
*'''Optimum use of resources.''' To make optimum use of resources such as men, material, money, machine and method, it is necessary to design an organization properly. Work should be divided and right people should be given right jobs to reduce the wastage of resources in an organization.
*'''To perform managerial function.''' Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing and Controlling cannot be implemented without proper organization.
*'''Facilitates growth and diversification.''' A good organization structure is essential for expanding business activity. Organization structure determines the input resources needed for expansion of a business activity similarly organization is essential for product diversification such as establishing a new product line. it also stimulates creativity in managers by organizing.
*'''Humane treatment of employees.''' Organization has to operate for the betterment of employees and must not encourage monotony of work due to higher degree of specialization. Now, organization has adapted the modern concept of systems approach based on human relations and it discards the traditional productivity and specialization approach.

==Applications==
'''Organizing''', in [[company|companies]] point of view, is the management function that usually follows after planning. And it involves the assignment of tasks, the grouping of tasks into departments and the assignment of authority with adequate responsibility and allocation of resources across the organization to achieve common goals.

===Structure===

The framework in which the organization defines how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and departments are coordinated.

#A set of formal tasks assigned to individuals and departments.
#Formal reporting relationships, including lines of authority, decision responsibility, number of hierarchical levels and span of managers control.
#The design of systems to ensure effective coordination of employees across departments.

=== Work specialization===

Work specialization (also called [[division of labour]] or job specialization) is the degree to which organizational tasks are sub-divided into individual jobs. It may increase the efficiency of workers, but with too much specialization, employees may feel isolated and bored. Many organizations enlarge jobs or rotate assigned tasks to provide greater challenges.

===Chain of command===
[[Command hierarchy|Chain of command]] is the vertical lines of a command structure that is used for the purposes of overall responsibility and accountability in the achieving of stated goals and objectives through the use of orders one direction and reports of compliance in the other direction.  Chain of command differs from horizontal lines in an organization which are basically the communication and coordinating lines of the organization.
Chain of command(also referred to as 'scalar principle') states that a clear , unbroken chain of command should link every employee with someone at a higher level, all the way to the top of the organisation.

===Authority, responsibility, and accountability===

*'''Authority''' is a manager's formal and legitimate right to make decisions, issue orders, and allocate resources to achieve organizationally desired outcomes.
*'''Responsibility''' means an employee's duty to perform assigned task or activities.
*'''Accountability''' means that those with authority and responsibility must report and justify task outcomes to those above them in the chain of command.

===Delegation===

Delegation is the transfer of authority and/or responsibility to others, often lower in position. Delegation can improve flexibility to meet customers’ needs and adapt to competitive environments.
Possible reasons for delegation:
1. Efficiency - many people can complete a task faster than one/few
2. Specialization - delegating simple tasks allows more important/complex tasks to be completed by the most qualified
3. Training - delegating a task to a trainee so that they may learn from experience

===Types of authority (and responsibility)===

'''Line authority''' managers have the formal power to direct and control immediate subordinates. The superior issues orders and is responsible for the result and the subordinate obeys and is responsible only for executing the order according to instructions.

'''Functional authority''' is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is "advice" rather than "order".

'''Staff authority''' is granted to staff specialists in their areas of expertise. It is not a real authority in the sense that a staff manager does not order or instruct but simply advises,  recommends, and counsels in the staff specialists' area of expertise and is responsible only for the quality of the advice (to be in line with the respective professional standards etc.) It is a communication relationship with [[management]].  It has an influence that derives indirectly from line authority at a higher level.

''' Line and Staff Authority''' is the combination of Line organization and Staff organization.  Such organization follows both the principles of scalar chain of command and there is a provision for specialized activities  to be performed by staff officers who act in an advisory capacity

===Span of management===
Categories:
*Direct single relationship.
*Direct group relationships.
*Cross relationship.
Factors influencing larger span of management.
#Work performed by subordinates is stable and routine.
#Subordinates perform similar work tasks.
#Subordinates are concentrated in a single location.
#Subordinates are highly trained and need little direction in performing tasks.
#Rules and procedures defining task activities are available.
#Support systems and personnel are available for the managers.
#Little time is required in non-supervisory activities such as coordination with other departments or planning.
#Managers' personal preferences and styles favor a large span.

===Tall versus flat structure===

*'''Tall''' - A management structure characterized by an overall narrow span of management and a relatively large number of hierarchical levels. Tight control. [[Hierarchical organization|Reduced communication overhead]].
*'''Flat''' - A management structure characterized by a wide span of control and relatively few hierarchical levels. Loose control. Facilitates delegation.

===Centralization, decentralization, and formalization===

*'''Centralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near top organizational levels.
*'''Decentralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near lower organizational levels.
*'''Formalization''' - The written documentation used to direct and control employees.

===Departmentalization===

[[Departmentalization]] is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations. Approach options include:
#'''Functional''' - by common skills and work task
#'''Divisional''' - common product, program or geographical location
#'''Matrix'''     - combination of Functional and Divisional
#'''Team'''       - to accomplish specific tasks
#'''Network'''    - departments are independent providing functions for a central core breaker

===Importance of organizing===

*Organizations are often troubled by how to organize, particularly when a new strategy is developed
*Changing market conditions or new technology requires change
*Organizations seek efficiencies through improvements in organizing

'''''Planet Coaster''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Frontier Developments]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was released worldwide on 17 November 2016. Frontier had previously worked in the amusement park construction and management genre with ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'' (to which ''Planet Coaster'' is a [[spiritual successor]]), ''[[Thrillville]]'', ''[[Thrillville: Off the Rails]]'', and ''[[Zoo Tycoon (2013 video game)|Zoo Tycoon]]''.

There are three different modes in the game, namely Sandbox, Challenge, and Career. In the career mode, players assume the role of a theme park manager, and must complete tasks such as constructing unfinished roller coasters or hiring janitors. In Sandbox mode, players are tasked to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. The challenge mode is similar to the sandbox mode, but with added difficulty, as players need to take funds into account.

Originally called ''Coaster Park Tycoon'', the game was revealed on 29 January 2015 and was renamed during [[E3 2015]]. ''Planet Coaster'' is Frontier's second self-published franchise, following ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]''. Frontier organized multiple alpha and beta testings before launching in November 2016. The game was supported with free post-release [[downloadable content]] upon launch. The title received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's sandbox mode and creation tools. Criticisms were mainly directed to the game's career mode. It was a commercial success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in its first month of release.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Planet Coaster Guests.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional image of guests riding a [[Pirate ship (ride)|pirate ship ride]].]]
''Planet Coaster'' is a [[construction and management simulation]] video game. Similar to its spiritual predecessor, the game allows players to build different theme park rides and roller-coasters. These player-created attractions can be shared through a mechanic called "global village".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/16/elite-dangerous-studio-debuts-planet-coaster-theme-park-simulator/|title=Elite: Dangerous studio debuts Planet Coaster theme-park simulator (update)|first=Gavin|last=Greene|date=16 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also comes with ten [[Costumed character#In theme parks, international fairs, and festivals|mascot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Christopher|title=The Planet Coaster mascots ranked from worst to best|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-planet-coaster-mascots-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=PC Gamer|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before starting the game, the player must create their own [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. Afterwards, the player is able to choose between three game modes: sandbox, challenge, and career.

Similar to Frontier's previous game, ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', the Sandbox Mode enables players to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. In Sandbox Mode, all features and rides of the game are unlocked and your funds are unlimited. This is the mode most players use to create items (parks, coasters, scenery, etc.) and then post them to Steam's Planet Coaster Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forward|first1=Jordan|title=The best Planet Coaster creations|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/planet-coaster/planet-coaster-creations|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=PCGamesN|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Challenge Mode, the player must construct an amusement park on an empty lot (similar to Sandbox Mode) but with limited funds and research depending on chosen difficulty—Easy, Medium, or Hard. As the player develops their park, the game presents the player with challenges that the player must accept or decline. Upon completion of a challenge, the player is given a reward such as a park rating boost or a sum of money.

In the Career Mode, the player must complete objectives such as constructing [[roller coaster]]s, achieving park ratings or hiring [[janitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harker|first1=Clover|title=Gamereactor UK|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/reviews/482583/Planet+Coaster/|accessdate=23 November 2016|work=www.gamereactor.eu|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Frontier's previous game, ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', Career Mode allows players to progress by completing scenarios with objectives in different difficulties.

First unveiled at [[EGX (expo)|EGX 2016]], the game also features a dedicated mode called the "crash mode" which allows players to construct incomplete coasters and let them crash into the park's visitors.&lt;ref name="Venture"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/24/planet-coaster-announces-a-mode-dedicated-to-crashes/|title=Planet Coaster announces a mode dedicated to crashes|first=Mike|last=Minotti|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=24 September 2016|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2017, Frontier revealed the existence of several cheat codes that were previously undiscovered on their official [[Internet forum|forums]]. These included the ability to ride [[go-kart]]s and the ability for [[security guard]]s to plough through guests similarly to a [[bulldozer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Tom|last2=Fenlon|first2=Wes|title=Planet Coaster cheat lets you drive go-karts in first person|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/planet-coaster-cheat-lets-you-drive-go-karts-in-first-person-make-everyone-puke/|accessdate=27 April 2017|work=PC Gamer|date=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wales|first1=Matt|title=There's a Cheat Code That Turns Planet Coaster into a Mini Racer|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/04/26/theres-a-cheat-code-that-turns-planet-coaster-into-a-mini-racer|accessdate=27 April 2017|work=Kotaku UK|date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Planet Coaster Art.jpg|thumb|right|Concept art of an [[Animatronics|animatronic]] [[Red coat (British Army and Royal Marines)|redcoat]].]]

=== Pre-release ===
The game was met with praise upon release of the alpha. Andy Kelly of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' commented that Frontier was "off to a tremendous start", adding that creating buildings with the creation tools hinted at "immense possibilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Andy|title=Planet Coaster: hands-on with Frontier's theme park sim|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/planet-coaster-we-play-frontiers-theme-park-sim/|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mark Walton of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' noted several small flaws including the "hard to navigate" menus and the lack of custom built roller coasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walton|first1=Mark|title=Planet Coaster: A theme park sim so good its developers forgot to develop it|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2016/03/planet-coaster-theme-park-sim-alpha-preview/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2016, about a month after the release of the alpha, Frontier announced that ''Planet Coaster'' had grossed nearly two million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Alex|title=Planet Coaster Has Nearly Made $2 Million Already|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/04/planet-coaster-has-nearly-made-2-million-already/|website=www.kotaku.com.au|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===

Matt Wales of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' recommended the game, concluding that the game is "the finest simulator yet".&lt;ref name="EuroG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wales|first1=Matt|title=Planet Coaster review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-20-planet-coaster-review|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Eurogamer|date=21 November 2016|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ben Reeves of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game for its creative mode but criticized the game's career mode, referring it to as "boring" and "tedious".&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; TJ Hafer of ''[[IGN]]'' compared the game's integration of [[Steam Workshop]] to ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Edmond Tran of ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised the game for its accessible creative tools and for its evocative tone.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Jonathan Leack of [[Game Revolution]] claimed that the game "resurrected the [theme park simulation] genre".&lt;ref name=Rev/&gt; In a critical review of the game, Jody Macgregor of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the game's challenge mode but criticized the game for not innovating enough from ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]''.

'''Polymer solution casting''' is a [[manufacturing process]] used to make flexible plastic components which are typically in the shape of a single or multi-lumen tube commonly utilized in the medical device industry.  This manufacturing technology is unique in that the process does not require conventional [[extrusion]] or [[injection molding]] technologies, yet it readily incorporates components and features traditionally produced by these processes.

The polymer solution casting process utilizes a [[mandrel]], or inner diameter mold, that is immersed in a tank of polymer solution or liquid plastic that has been specifically engineered for the process.  Due to a combination of thermal and frictional properties, the polymer solution then forms a thin film around the mold.&lt;ref name=thinfilm&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2Fb107336 Solvent cast technology - a versatile tool for thin film production]. springer.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mold is then extracted from the tank in a precisely controlled manner, followed by a curing or drying process.  Once the first layer of thin film is appropriately solidified, secondary features can be added to the product such as braided or coiled wire, laser-cut hypotubes or engineered metal reinforcements to prevent kinking, or imaging targets specific to the intended medical application.  Multiple casting steps can then be repeated to encapsulate the reinforcements, build up wall thickness, add additional lumens and optimize column strength. The part is then removed from the mold after it is cured or solidified. 
 
The most notable attribute of this thin-film process technology is the ability to alternate the material properties (i.e. strength, [[durometer]], color, [[lubricity]]) amongst the individual layers or even down the length of the part, resulting in a feature-rich single-piece construction. This process also allows other components to be incorporated into the structure of the part during the layering processes, such as injection molded components and extruded tubes made of [[High Performance Polymers|high performance polymers]] such as [[PTFE]], [[Pebax|PEBAX]], and [[polyimide]].

Another notable advantage of polymer solution casting technology is that the total manufacturing cost for both prototyping and production volumes are frequently less than the conventional technologies. This cost benefit results from the use of inexpensive molds coupled with the scalability and adaptability of the manufacturing line.  As a result, new products and processes are readily developed and implemented, facilitating cost-effective creation of very feature rich and complex [[catheters]].
Since the 1990s, Avalon Laboratories and Piper Plastics Corp. have aggressively pioneered polymer solution casting technology, focusing on complex medical devices.  The history of these technologies dates back to many highly regarded names in the medical industry including [[Medtronic]], BioMedicus, Bard, [[Terumo]], Research Medical Inc., Shiley, Polaris Plastics, and Caplugs.

== Materials ==
Polymer solution casting technology can be deployed utilizing a host of different polymer materials depending on the application and design inputs, including those used in Class I, II and III medical devices.&lt;ref name=polymers&gt;[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4613-1809-5 Polymers in Medicine II]. springer.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest and most commonly found materials were polyvinyl chlorides ([[PVC]]) due to their advantages in cost, physical properties and clarity.  Over the past twenty years, there has been scrutiny of the long term health effects of the PVC base materials relating to the plasticizers and stabilizers which are needed to ensure adequate shelf life of sterilized product. More recently, newly engineered formulations have eliminated these biocompatibility concerns while extending the shelf life, and PVC has re-emerged as a preferred polymer for use in interventional and surgical applications.

[[Polyurethane]] has emerged as another polymer that meets the medical device market's demands for thinner wall sections, longer lengths and extended blood exposure.  The high strength and range of properties make these materials an excellent choice for soft [[elastomer]] applications.  Among the first commercial polyurethane medical products were non-allergenic [[medical gloves]], developed as a response to latex allergies.  These advanced polymers offer a full range of physical properties, improved biocompatibility, and lubricous properties by way of custom formulations and coatings.

Another material choice for polymer solution casting is silicone urethane copolymers, which are among the most biocompatible synthetic materials. This class of medical grade material was developed for long-term implantable device applications and offers the physical characteristics of high elongation, low [[modulus of elasticity]], excellent recovery, and resistance to chemicals, oil, and [[UV light]].

While there exists a number of materials to choose from while deploying polymer solution casting technology, the material science work continues in the areas of wall thickness, strength, lubricity, biocompatibility and clarity as well as interactions of the liquid polymers with extruded and injection molded components.

'''Process chemistry''' is the arm of pharmaceutical chemistry concerned with the development and optimization of a synthetic scheme and pilot plant procedure to manufacture compounds for the drug development phase. Process chemistry is distinguished from [[medicinal chemistry]], which is the arm of pharmaceutical chemistry tasked with designing and synthesizing molecules on small scale in the early drug discovery phase.

Medicinal chemists are largely concerned with synthesizing a large number of compounds as quickly as possible from easily tunable chemical building blocks (usually for [[Structure-activity relationship|SAR]] studies). In general, the repertoire of reactions utilized in discovery chemistry is somewhat narrow (for example, the [[Buchwald-Hartwig amination]], [[Suzuki coupling]] and [[reductive amination]] are commonplace reactions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roughley|first=S. D.|author2=Jordan, A. M.|title=The medicinal chemist's toolbox: an analysis of reactions used in the pursuit of drug candidates|journal=J. Med. Chem.|year=2011|volume=54|pages=3451–79|doi=10.1021/jm200187y|pmid=21504168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, process chemists are tasked with identifying a chemical process that is safe, cost and labor efficient, “green,” and reproducible, among other considerations. Oftentimes, in searching for the shortest, most efficient synthetic route, process chemists must devise creative synthetic solutions that eliminate costly functional group manipulations and oxidation/reduction steps.

This article focuses exclusively on the chemical and manufacturing processes associated with the production of small molecule drugs. [[Biologics|Biological medical products]] (more commonly called “biologics”) represent a growing proportion of approved therapies, but the manufacturing processes of these products are beyond the scope of this article. Additionally, the many complex factors associated with chemical plant engineering (for example, heat transfer and reactor design) and [[drug formulation]] will be treated cursorily.

== Process chemistry considerations ==
Cost efficiency is of paramount importance in process chemistry and, consequently, is a focus in the consideration of pilot plant synthetic routes. The drug substance that is manufactured, prior to formulation, is commonly referred to as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and will be referred to as such herein. API production cost can be broken into two components: the “material cost” and the “conversion cost.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dach|first=R.|author2=Song, J. J. |author3=Roschangar, F. |author4=Samstag, W. |author5= Senanayake, C. H. |title=The eight criteria defining a good chemical manufacturing process|journal=Org. Process Res. Dev.|year=2012|volume=16|pages=1697–1706|doi=10.1021/op300144g}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ecological and environmental impact of a synthetic process should also be evaluated by an appropriate metric (e.g. the EcoScale).

An ideal process chemical route will score well in each of these metrics, but inevitably tradeoffs are to be expected. Most large pharmaceutical process chemistry and manufacturing divisions have devised weighted quantitative schemes to measure the overall attractiveness of a given synthetic route over another. As cost is a major driver, material cost and volume-time output are typically weighted heavily.

=== Material cost ===
The material cost of a chemical process is the sum of the costs of all raw materials, intermediates, reagents, solvents and catalysts procured from external vendors. Material costs may influence the selection of one synthetic route over another or the decision to outsource production of an intermediate.

=== Conversion cost ===
The conversion cost of a chemical process is a factor of that procedure's overall efficiency, both in materials and time, and its reproducibility. The efficiency of a chemical process can be quantified by its atom economy, yield, volume-time output, and environmental factor (E-factor), and its reproducibility can be evaluated by the Quality Service Level (QSL) and Process Excellence Index (PEI) metrics.

[[File:Atom Economy - Claisen and Wittig Example.pdf|300px|thumbnail|right|An illustrative example of atom economy using the Claisen rearrangement and Wittig reaction.]]

==== Atom economy ====

The [[atom economy]] of a reaction is defined as the number of atoms from the starting materials that are incorporated into the final product. Atom economy can be viewed as an indicator of the “efficiency” of a given synthetic route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trost|first=B. M.|title=The atom economy - a search for synthetic efficiency|journal=Science|year=1991|volume=254|pages=1471–7|doi=10.1126/science.1962206|pmid=1962206|issue=5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;AE = \frac{\text{MW(product)}}{\sum \text{MW(raw materials)}}\times 100\%&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[Claisen rearrangement]] and the [[Diels-Alder|Diels-Alder cycloaddition]] are examples of reaction that are 100 percent atom economical. On the other hand, a prototypical [[Wittig reaction]] has especially poor atom economy (merely 20 percent in the example shown).

Process synthetic routes should be designed such that atom economy is maximized for the entire synthetic scheme. Consequently, “costly” reagents such as protecting groups and high molecular weight leaving groups should be avoided where possible. An atom economy value in the range of 70 to 90 percent for an API synthesis is ideal, but it may be impractical or impossible to access certain complex targets within this range. Nevertheless, atom economy is a good metric to compare two routes to the same molecule.

==== Yield ====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
[[Yield (chemistry)|Yield]] is defined as the amount of product obtained in a chemical reaction the yield of practical significance in process chemistry is the isolated yield—the yield of the isolated product after all purification steps.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In a final API synthesis, isolated yields of 80 percent or above for each synthetic step are expected.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The definition of an acceptable yield depends entirely on the importance of the product and the ways in which available technologies come together to allow their efficient application; yields approaching 100% are termed quantitative, and yields above 90% are broadly understood as excellent.&lt;ref&gt;In an academic perspective, Furniss, et al., in ''Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry'', describes yields around 100% as ''quantitative'', yields above 90% as ''excellent'', above 80% as ''very good'', above 70% as ''good'', above 50% as ''fair'', and yields below this as ''poor''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math chem title="An illustrative example of convergent synthesis"&gt;
\begin{array}{|r|r|r|}
\hline
&amp; \text{Illustrative Example} &amp; \text{Overall Yield}\\
\hline
\color{BrickRed}\text{Linear Synthesis} &amp; \ce{A -&gt;[85\%] B -&gt;[85\%] C -&gt;[85\%] Product} &amp; \color{BrickRed}{61.4\%}\\
\hline
\color{PineGreen}\text{Convergent Synthesis} &amp; \left. \begin{matrix}\ce{A -&gt;[85\%] B} \\ \ce{D -&gt;[85\%] E} \end{matrix} \quad \right\} \ce{-&gt; Product} &amp; \color{PineGreen}{72.3\%}\\

\hline
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
There are several strategies that are employed in the design of a process route to ensure adequate overall yield of the pharmaceutical product. The first is the concept of [[convergent synthesis]]. Assuming a very good to excellent yield in each synthetic step, the overall yield of a multistep reaction can be maximized by combining several key intermediates at a late stage that are prepared independently from each other.

Another strategy to maximize isolated yield (as well as time efficiency) is the concept of [[one-pot synthesis|telescoping synthesis]] (also called one-pot synthesis). This approach describes the process of eliminating workup and purification steps from a reaction sequence, typically by simply adding reagents sequentially to a reactor. In this way, unnecessary losses from these steps can be avoided.

Finally, to minimize overall cost, synthetic steps involving expensive reagents, solvents or catalysts should be designed into the process route as late stage as possible, to minimize the amount of reagent used.

In a pilot plant or manufacturing plant setting, yield can have a profound effect on the material cost of an API synthesis, so the careful planning of a robust route and the fine-tuning of reaction conditions are crucially important. After a synthetic route has been selected, process chemists will subject each step to exhaustive optimization in order to maximize overall yield. Low yields are typically indicative of unwanted side product formation, which can raise red flags in the regulatory process as well as pose challenges for reactor cleaning operations.

==== Volume-time output ====
The volume-time output (VTO) of a chemical process represents the cost of occupancy of a chemical reactor for a particular process or API synthesis. For example, a high VTO indicates that a particular synthetic step is costly in terms of “reactor hours” used for a given output. Mathematically, the VTO for a particular process is calculated by the total volume of all reactors (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that are occupied times the hours per batch divided by the output for that batch of API or intermediate (measured in kg).

:&lt;math chem&gt;VTO=\frac{\text{nominal volume of all reactors} [\ce{m}^3]*\text{time per batch} [\ce h]}{\text{output per step} [\ce{kg}]}&lt;/math&gt;

The process chemistry group at Boehringer-Ingelheim, for example, targets a VTO of less than 1 for any given synthetic step or chemical process.

Additionally, the raw conversion cost of an API synthesis (in dollars per batch) can be calculated from the VTO, given the operating cost and usable capacity of a particular reactor. Oftentimes, for large-volume APIs, it is economical to build a dedicated production plant rather than to use space in general pilot plants or manufacturing plants.

==== Environmental factor ([[Green chemistry metrics|e-factor]]) and process mass intensity (PMI) ====
Both of these measures, which capture the environmental impact of a synthetic reaction, intend to capture the significant and rising cost of waste disposal in the manufacturing process. The E-factor for an entire API process is computed by the ratio of the total mass of waste generated in the synthetic scheme to the mass of product isolated.

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{\sum \text{mass of waste}}{\text{mass of isolated product}}=\frac{\sum \text{mass of materials}-\text{mass of isolated product}}{\text{mass of isolated product}}&lt;/math&gt;

A similar measure, the process mass intensity (PMI) calculates the ratio of the total mass of materials to the mass of the isolated product.

&lt;math&gt;PMI=\frac{\sum \text{mass of materials}}{\text{mass of isolated product}} = E +1&lt;/math&gt;

For both metrics, all materials used in all synthetic steps, including reaction and workup solvents, reagents and catalysts, are counted, even if solvents or catalysts are recycled in practice. Inconsistencies in E-factor or PMI computations may arise when choosing to consider the waste associated with the synthesis of outsourced intermediates or common reagents. Additionally, the environmental impact of the generated waste is ignored in this calculation; therefore, the environmental quotient (EQ) metric was devised, which multiplies the E-factor by an “unfriendliness quotient” associated with various waste streams. A reasonable target for the E-factor or PMI of a single synthetic step is any value between 10 and 40.

==== Quality service level (QSL) ====
The final two "conversion cost" considerations involve the reproducibility of a given reaction or API synthesis route. The quality service level (QSL) is a measure of the reproducibility of the quality of the isolated intermediate or final API. While the details of computing this value are slightly nuanced and unimportant for the purposes of this article, in essence, the calculation involves the ratio of satisfactory quality batches to the total number of batches. A reasonable QSL target is 98 to 100 percent.

==== Process excellence index (PEI) ====
Like the QSL, the process excellence index (PEI) is a measure of process reproducibility. Here, however, the robustness of the procedure is evaluated in terms of yield and cycle time of various operations. The PEI yield is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{PEI yield}=\frac{\text{average yield}\cdot 100\%}{\text{aspiration level yield}}=\frac{\text{average yield}\cdot 100\%}{\frac{\text{median yield}+\text{best yield}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, if a process is high-yielding and has a narrow distribution of yield outcomes, then the PEI should be very high. Processes that are not easily reproducible may have a higher aspiration level yield and a lower average yield, lowering the PEI yield.

Similarly, a PEI cycle time may be defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{PEI cycle time}=\frac{\text{aspiration level cycle time}\cdot 100\%}{\text{average cycle time}}=\frac{\frac{\text{median cycle time}+\text{best cycle time}}{2}}{\text{average cycle time}}&lt;/math&gt;

For this expression, the terms are inverted to reflect the desirability of shorter cycle times (as opposed to higher yields). The reproducibility of cycle times for critical processes such as reaction, centrifugation or drying may be critical if these operations are rate-limiting in the manufacturing plant setting. For example, if an isolation step is particularly difficult or slow, it could become the bottleneck for an API synthesis, in which case the reproducibility and optimization of that operation become critical.

For an API manufacturing process, all PEI metrics (yield and cycle times) should be targeted at 98 to 100 percent.

=== EcoScale ===
In 2006, Van Aken, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Aken|first=K.|author2=Strekowski, L. |author3=Patiny, L. |title=EcoScale, a semi-quantitative tool to select an organic preparation based on economical and ecological parameters|journal=Beilstein J. Org. Chem.|year=2006|volume=2|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the safety and ecological impact of a chemical process, as well as minor weighting of practical and economical considerations. Others have modified this EcoScale by adding, subtracting and adjusting the weighting of various metrics. Among other factors, the EcoScale takes into account the toxicity, flammability and explosive stability of reagents used, any nonstandard or potentially hazardous reaction conditions (for example, elevated pressure or inert atmosphere), and reaction temperature. Some EcoScale criteria are redundant with previously considered criteria (e.g. E-factor).

=== Boehringer Ingelheim HCV protease inhibitor (BI 201302) ===
Macrocyclization is a recurrent challenge for process chemists, and large pharmaceutical companies have necessarily developed creative strategies to overcome these inherent limitations. An interesting case study in this area involves the development of novel NS3 protease inhibitors to treat [[Hepatitis C]] patients by scientists at [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faucher|first=A-M. |author2=Bailey, M. D. |author3=Beaulieu, P. L. |author4=Brochu, C. |author5=Duceppe, J-S. |author6=Ferland, J-M. |author7=Ghiro, E. |author8=Gorys, V. |author9=Halmos, T. |author10=Kawai, S.

Two significant shortcomings were immediately identified with the initial scale-up route to BILN 2061, depicted in the scheme below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yee|first=N. K. |author2=Farina, V. |author3=Houpis, I. N. |author4=Haddad, N. |author5=Frutos, R. P. |author6=Gallou, F. |author7=Wang, X-J. |author8=Wei, X. |author9=Simpson, R.

Chem.|year=2006|volume=71|pages=7133–7145|doi=10.1021/jo060285j}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The macrocyclization step posed four challenges inherent to the [[Cross metathesis|cross-metathesis]] reaction.

# '''High dilution''' is typically necessary to prevent unwanted dimerization and oligomerization of the diene starting material. In a pilot plant setting, however, a high dilution factor translates into lower throughput, higher solvent costs and higher waste costs.
# '''High catalyst loading''' was found to be necessary to drive the [[Ring-closing metathesis|RCM]] reaction to completion. Because of high licensing costs of the ruthenium catalyst that was used (1st generation [[Grubbs' catalyst|Hoveyda catalyst]]), a high catalyst loading was financially prohibitive. Recycling of the catalyst was explored, but proved impractical.
# '''Long reaction times''' were necessary for reaction completion, due to slow kinetics of the reaction using the selected catalyst. It was hypothesized that this limitation could be overcome using a more active catalyst. However, while the second-generation Hoveyda and Grubbs catalysts were kinetically more active than the first-generation catalyst, reactions using these catalysts formed large amounts of dimeric and oligomeric products.

Additionally, the final double [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]] sequence to install the [[quinoline]] heterocycle was identified as a secondary inefficiency in the synthetic route.

Analysis of the cross-methathesis reaction revealed that the conformation of the acyclic precursor had a profound impact on the formation of dimers and oligomers in the reaction mixture. By installing a [[Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc protecting group]] at the C-4 amide nitrogen, the Boehringer-Ingelheim chemists were able to shift the site of initiation from the vinylcyclopropane moiety to the nonenoic acid moiety, improving the rate of the intramolecular reaction and decreasing the risk of epimerization. Additionally, the catalyst employed was switched from the expensive 1st generation Hoveyda catalyst to the more reactive, less expensive Grela catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grela|first=K.|author2=Harutyunyan, S. |author3=Michrowska, A. |title=A highly efficient ruthenium catalyst for metathesis reactions|journal=Angew.

Additionally, the process chemistry team envisioned a [[Nucleophilic aromatic substitution|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar]] strategy to install the quinoline heterocycle, instead of the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 strategy that they had employed for the synthesis of BILN 2061. This modification prevented the need for inefficient double inversion by proceeding through retention of stereochemistry at the C-4 position of the hydroxyproline moiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=X. |author2=Shu, C. |author3=Haddad, N. |author4=Zeng, X. |author5=Patel, N.

It is interesting to examine this case study from a VTO perspective. For the unoptimized cross-metathesis reaction using the Grela catalyst at 0.01 M diene, the reaction yield was determined to be 82 percent after a reaction and workup time of 48 hours. A 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 35&amp;nbsp;kg of desired product. For the unoptimized reaction:

&lt;math&gt;\text{VTO} = \frac{6\text{ m}^{3} \times 48\text{ h}}{35\text{ kg}} = 8.2\text{ m}^{3} \cdot \text{ h / kg}&lt;/math&gt;

This VTO value was considered prohibitively high and a steep investment in a dedicated plant would have been necessary even before launching Phase III trials with this API, given its large projected annual demand. But after reaction development and optimization, the process team was able to improve the reaction yield to 93 percent after just 1 hour (plus 12 hours for workup and reactor cleaning time) at a diene concentration of 0.2 M. With these modifications, a 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 799&amp;nbsp;kg of desired product. For this optimized reaction:

&lt;math&gt;\text{VTO} = \frac{6\text{ m}^{3}\times 13\text{ h}}{799\text{ kg}} = 0.1\text{ m}^{3} \cdot \text{ h / kg}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, after optimization, this synthetic step became less costly in terms of equipment and time and more practical to perform in a standard manufacturing facility, eliminating the need for a costly investment in a new dedicated plant.

=== [[Biocatalysis]] and enzymatic engineering ===
Recently, large pharmaceutical process chemists have relied heavily on the development of enzymatic reactions to produce important chiral building blocks for API synthesis. Many varied classes of naturally occurring enzymes have been co-opted and engineered for process pharmaceutical chemistry applications. The widest range of applications come from [[Aldo-keto reductase|ketoreductases]] and [[transaminase]]s, but there are isolated examples from [[hydrolases]], [[aldolase]]s, oxidative enzymes, [[esterase]]s and [[dehalogenase]]s, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornscheuer|first=U.

One of the most prominent uses of biocatalysis in process chemistry today is in the synthesis of [[Januvia]]®, a [[DPP4 (gene)|DPP-4]] inhibitor developed by Merck for the management of [[type II diabetes]]. The traditional process synthetic route involved a late-stage enamine formation followed by rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation to afford the API [[sitagliptin]]. This process suffered from a number of limitations, including the need to run the reaction under a high-pressure hydrogen environment, the high cost of a transition-metal catalyst, the difficult process of carbon treatment to remove trace amounts of catalyst and insufficient stereoselectivity, requiring a subsequent recrystallization step before final salt formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savile|first=C.

[[File:Sitagliptin biosynthetic route.pdf|700px|frameless|center|Comparison of the chemosynthetic and biosynthetic routes toward sitagliptin.]]

Merck’s process chemistry department contracted [[Codexis]], a medium-sized biocatalysis firm, to develop a large-scale biocatalytic reductive amination for the final step of its sitagliptin synthesis. Codexis engineered a transaminase enzyme from the bacteria Arthrobacter through 11 rounds of directed evolution. The engineered transaminase contained 27 individual point mutations and displayed activity four orders of magnitude greater than the parent enzyme. Additionally, the enzyme was engineered to handle high substrate concentrations (100 g/L) and to tolerate the organic solvents, reagents and byproducts of the transamination reaction. This biocatalytic route successfully avoided the limitations of the chemocatalyzed hydrogenation route: the requirements to run the reaction under high pressure, to remove excess catalyst by carbon treatment and to recrystallize the product due to insufficient enantioselectivity were obviated by the use of a biocatalyst. Merck and Codexis were awarded the [[Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award]] in 2010 for the development of this biocatalytic route toward Januvia®.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Busacca|first=C.

=== Continuous/flow manufacturing ===
In recent years, much progress has been made in the development and optimization of [[Flow chemistry|flow reactors]] for small-scale chemical synthesis (the [http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/jamison/ Jamison Group] at MIT and [http://www.leygroup.ch.cam.ac.uk/ Ley Group] at Cambridge University, among others, have pioneered efforts in this field). The pharmaceutical industry, however, has been slow to adopt this technology for large-scale synthetic operations. For certain reactions, however, continuous processing may possess distinct advantages over batch processing in terms of safety, quality and throughput.

A case study of particular interest involves the development of a fully continuous process by the process chemistry group at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] for an [[asymmetric hydrogenation]] to access a key intermediate in the synthesis of LY500307,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=M. D. |author2=May, S. A. |author3=Calvin, J. R. |author4=Remacle, J. |author5=Stout, J. R. |author6=Dieroad, W. D. |author7=Zaborenko, N. |author8=Haeberle, B. D. |author9=Sun, W-M. |author10=Miller, M. T. |author11=Brannan, J. |title=Development and scale-up of a continuous, high-pressure, asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, workup, and isolation|journal=Org. Process Res. Rev.|year=2012|volume=16|pages=1017–1038|doi=10.1021/op200362h}}&lt;/ref&gt; a potent [[Estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]] agonist that is entering clinical trials for the treatment of patients with [[schizophrenia]], in addition to a regimen of standard antipsychotic medications. In this key synthetic step, a chiral rhodium-catalyst is used for the enantioselective reduction of a tetrasubstituted olefin. After extensive optimization, it was found that in order to reduce the catalyst loading to a commercially practical level, the reaction required hydrogen pressure up to 70 atm. The pressure limit of a standard chemical reactor is about 10 atm, although high-pressure batch reactors may be acquired at significant capital cost for reactions up to 100 atm. Especially for an API in the early stages of chemical development, such an investment clearly bears a large risk.

An additional concern was that the hydrogenation product has an unfavorable [[eutectic point]], so it was impossible to isolate the crude intermediate in more than 94 percent ee by batch process. Because of this limitation, the process chemistry route toward LY500307 necessarily involved a kinetically controlled [[crystallization]] step after the hydrogenation to upgrade the enantiopurity of this penultimate intermediate to &gt;99 percent ee.

[[File:LY500307 Continuous Flow Synthesis.pdf|800px|frameless|center|Comparison of the batch and continuous flow processes toward LY500307.]]

The process chemistry team at Eli Lilly successfully developed a fully continuous process to this penultimate intermediate, including reaction, workup and kinetically controlled crystallization modules (the engineering considerations implicit in these efforts are beyond the scope of this article). An advantage of flow reactors is that high-pressure tubing can be utilized for hydrogenation and other hyperbaric reactions. Because the head space of a batch reactor is eliminated, however, many of the safety concerns associated with running high-pressure reactions are obviated by the use of a continuous process reactor. Additionally, a two-stage mixed suspension-mixed product removal (MSMPR) module was designed for the scalable, continuous, kinetically controlled crystallization of the product, so it was possible to isolate in &gt;99 percent ee, eliminating the need for an additional batch crystallization step.

This continuous process afforded 144&amp;nbsp;kg of the key intermediate in 86 percent yield, comparable with a 90 percent isolated yield using the batch process. This 73-liter pilot-scale flow reactor (occupying less than 0.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; space) achieved the same weekly throughput as theoretical batch processing in a 400-liter reactor. Therefore, the continuous flow process demonstrates advantages in safety, efficiency (eliminates the need for batch crystallization) and throughput, compared with a theoretical batch process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7304">'''Product data management''' ('''PDM''') or [[Product information management|Product information management (PIM)]] is the business function often within [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) that is responsible for the management and publication of [[Product (business)|product]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npd-solutions.com/pdm.html Product Data Management/Product information management], Kenneth Crow&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivica Crnkovic, Ulf Asklund, Annita Persson Dahlqvist "Implementing and Integrating Product Data Management and Software Configuration Management" {{ISBN|978-1580534987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In software engineering, this is known as [[version control]]. The goals of product data management include ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding, that confusion during the execution of the processes is minimized, and that the highest standards of quality controls are maintained.

== Introduction ==
Product data management is the use of software or other tools to track and control data related to a particular product. The data tracked usually involves the technical specifications of the product, specifications for manufacture and development, and the types of materials that will be required to produce goods. The use of product data management allows a company to track the various costs associated with the creation and launch of a product. Product data management is part of product lifecycle management and [[configuration management]], and is primarily used by engineers.

Within PDM the focus is on managing and tracking the creation, change and archive of all information related to a product. The information being stored and managed (on one or more file servers) will include engineering data such as [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) models, drawings and their associated documents.

Product data management (PDM) serves as a central knowledge repository for process and product history, and promotes integration and data exchange among all business users who interact with products — including project managers, engineers, sales people, buyers, and quality assurance teams.

The central database will also manage [[metadata]] such as owner of a file and release status of the components. The package will: control check-in and check-out of the product data to multi-user; carry out [[Change management (engineering)|engineering change management]] and release control on all versions/issues of components in a product; build and manipulate the product structure [[bill of materials]] (BOM) for assemblies; and assist in configurations management of product variants.

This enables automatic reports on product costs, etc. Furthermore, PDM enables companies producing complex products to spread product data into the entire [[product lifecycle management|PLM]] launch-process. This significantly enhances the effectiveness of the launch process.

Product data management is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through its development and useful life.  Typical information managed in the PDM module include
*Brand name
*Part number
*Part description
*Supplier/vendor
*Vendor part number and description
*Unit of measure
*Cost/price
*Schematic or CAD drawing
*Material data-sheets

==Advantages==

* Track and manage all changes to product related data
* Spend less time organizing and tracking design data
* Improve productivity through reuse of product design data
* Enhance collaboration
* Helps using visual management

== Industrial Applications ==
Product Data Management is closely related and often used interchangeably with Product Information Management (PIM).  PDM software applications are commonly used by companies involved with manufacturing and retailing. Examples of PDM software vendors include CMPRO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psasys.com/cmpro/|title=CMPRO - PSA, Inc.|work=PSA, Inc.|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOLIDWORKS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/product-data-management/packages.htm|title=Packages|website=www.solidworks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zentail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zentail.com|title=Sell on Jet.com, Walmart, Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping {{!}} Zentail|website=www.zentail.com|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bintime/Gepard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bintime.com|title=BINTIME provides a e-commerce development team, dedicated to your business goals|website=bintime.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from those providers, in the market exist other kind of vendors that offer [https://saleslayer.com/product-data-management-pdm PDM systems] with extra functionalities such as Sales Layer.

== History ==

PDM stems from traditional engineering design activities that created product drawings and schematics on paper and using CAD tools to create parts lists (Bills of Material structures – BOM).  The PDM and BOM data is used in enterprise resource planning ([[enterprise resource planning|ERP]]) systems to plan and coordinate all transactional operations of a company (sales order management, purchasing, cost accounting, logistics, etc.)

PDM is a subset of a larger concept of product lifecycle management ([[product lifecycle management|PLM]]).  PLM encompasses the processes needed to launch new products ([[New product introduction|NPI]]), manage changes to existing products ([[engineering change notice|ECN]]/[[Engineering change order|ECO]]) and retire products at the end of their life ([[End-of-life (product)|EoL]]).

In [[arbitration]], the '''repeat-player effect''' is a proposition that, outside of the [[collective bargaining]] context, employers attain more favorable outcomes in arbitration.&lt;ref name=bingham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bingham|first=Lisa|title=Employment Arbitration: The Repeat Player Effect|journal=Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal|year=1997|volume=1|pages=189–220|ssrn=1324411}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Factors contributing to the repeat-player effect include employers' having more information to gain an advantage in the arbitrator selection process, as well as influence on arbitrators, who may want to rule in the employer's favor to be selected in future arbitrations.&lt;ref name=colvin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colvin|first=Alexander J.

The '''Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which amends section 7(4) of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 in respect of rights of several fishery.

==Background==
The original Bill was introduced in the Scottish Parliament on 8 March 2000 by [[Tavish Scott]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]. The existing Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 required that a shellfish farmer seeking a Several Order to allow them to control an area of seabed on which to farm shellfish frequently encountered opposition from fishermen who fish in the area to be covered by the Order. If the Several Order was issued, all fishing was banned within the area covered, regardless of whether or not the fishing operations damaged the interests of the shellfish farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/billsPassed/b11s1fm.pdf ''Financial Memorandum''], Scottish Parliament, 8 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment to the 1967 Act allows Scottish Ministers making a Several Order to authorise the continuation of specified non-damaging fishing operations
within the area covered by the Order. The aim of the Bill was thus to avoid unnecessary and avoidable conflicts of interests between shellfish farmers and fishermen.

==Provision==
The purpose of the Bill was to permit Scottish Ministers to authorise the use by fishermen of non-damaging types of fishing gear such as creels in areas covered by Several
Fisheries Orders. Thus, in section 7 of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 (c.83) (protection of fisheries), in subsection (4)(a), after sub-paragraph (ii) there was inserted:

"or

(iii) in the case of several fishery, an implement of a type specified in the order and so used as not to disturb or injure in any manner shellfish of the description in question."

== Passage through Parliament==
The Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act 2000 asp 12 was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 28 September 2000. The bill was given the [[Royal Assent]] on 2 November 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">The '''Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community''', commonly referred to as '''NACE''' (for the French term ''"'''n'''omenclature statistique des '''a'''ctivités économiques dans la '''C'''ommunauté '''e'''uropéenne"''), is the [[Industry classification|industry standard classification system]] used in the European Union. The current version is revision 2 and was established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 as well as certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains. OJ L 393, 30.12.2006, p. 1–39. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32006R1893 EurLex]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the European implementation of the UN classification [[International Standard Industrial Classification|ISIC]], revision 4.

There's a correspondence between NACE and [[International Standard Industrial Classification|United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regso.asp?Ci=70&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=&amp;T=0&amp;p=2&lt;/ref&gt;

NACE is similar in function to the SIC and NAICS systems:
* [[Standard Industrial Classification]]
* [[North American Industry Classification System]]

[[Image:NACE chooser.png|right|thumb|a screenshot of NACE being used in a computer program]]

NACE uses four hierarchical levels:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GEN_DESC_VIEW_NOHDR&amp;StrNom=NACE_REV2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN EU RAMON classification database]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level 1: 21 sections identified by alphabetical letters A to U; 
* Level 2: 88 divisions identified by two-digit numerical codes (01 to 99); 
* Level 3: 272 groups identified by three-digit numerical codes (01.1 to 99.0); 
* Level 4: 615 classes identified by four-digit numerical codes (01.11 to 99.00).

The first four digits of the code, which is the first four levels of the classification system, are the same in all European countries. National implementations may introduce additional levels. The fifth digit might vary from country to country and further digits are sometimes placed by suppliers of databases.

'''''Takahashi v. Fish and Game Comm'n''''', 334 U.S. 410 (1948), was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The issue at hand was a restrictive law in California requiring American citizenship to get a fishing license. The Court held that this was an unreasonable restriction and was discriminatory to residents of Japanese ancestry.

==Background==

===Facts===
Torao Takahashi came from Japan to the United States and became a resident of [[Terminal Island]] in Los Angeles County, California in 1907.  Prior to 1943 California issued commercial fishing licenses to all qualified persons without regard to alienage or ineligibility to citizenship. From 1915 to 1942 Takahashi, under annual commercial fishing licenses issued by the State, fished in ocean waters off the California coast, apparently both within and without the three-mile coastal belt, and brought his fresh fish ashore for sale.  In 1942, while the United States country was at war with Japan, Takahashi and other California residents of Japanese ancestry were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly interned]] under military orders. The evacuation was legally challenged in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' but a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the evacuation.

In 1943, during the period of war and evacuation, an amendment to the California Fish and Game Code was adopted prohibiting issuance of a license to any "alien Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Stats. 1943, ch. 1100.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the state code was again amended by striking the 1943 provision for fear that it might be "declared unconstitutional" because directed only "against alien Japanese"; the new amendment banned issuance of licenses to any "person ineligible to citizenship," which classification included Japanese. Cal. Stats. 1945, ch. 181. Because of this state provision barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship under federal law, Takahashi, who met all other state requirements, was denied a license by the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife|California Fish and Game Commission]] upon his return to California in 1945.

===Claim===

Takahashi, an alien ineligible for citizenship, brought an action for mandamus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, to compel the Commission to issue him a commercial fishing license.

===California Superior Court===

The Superior Court first ordered issuance of a commercial fishing license authorizing Takahashi to bring ashore "catches of fish from the waters of the high seas beyond the State's territorial jurisdiction."

After appeal to the State Supreme Court by the State Commission the Superior Court amended its judgment so as to order a commercial license authorizing Takahashi to bring in catches of fish taken from the three-mile ocean belt adjacent to the California coast as well as from the high seas.  It held that lawful alien inhabitants of California, despite their ineligibility to citizenship, were entitled to engage in the vocation of commercial fishing on the high seas beyond the three-mile belt on the same terms as other lawful state inhabitants, and that the California code provision denying them this right violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

===Supreme Court of California===
A judgment granting the writ was reversed by the State Supreme Court, three judges dissenting.

The Court held that California had a proprietary interest in fish in the ocean waters within three miles of the shore, and that this interest justified the State in barring all aliens in general and aliens ineligible to citizenship in particular from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them to California for commercial purposes. 30 Cal. 2d 719, 185 P. 2d 805.

The state court held that this interest justified the state in barring all aliens in general, and aliens ineligible for citizenship in particular, from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them into the state for commercial purposes.

===Certiorari and arguments===
The Supreme Court granted certiorari. 333 U.S. 853, "to review this question of importance in the fields of federal-state relationships and of constitutionally protected individual equality and liberty".

==Opinion of the court==

The Court reversed.  [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] was joined by six other justices.

It held that the California statute forbidding the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to aliens ineligible to citizenship was held to violate the constitutional right of such aliens to the equal protection of the laws. The contention that the statute might be supported as a conservation measure was rejected.  The state could not, consistent with the United States Constitution, use federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring petitioner from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean water off the state coast. The refusal to issue petitioner a commercial fishing license violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and there was no special public interest to support the state ban on petitioner's commercial fishing.

A state prohibition of the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible to citizenship makes an unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (distinguishing ''[[Terrace v. Thompson]]'', 263 US 197; ''[[Porterfield v. Webb]]'', 263 US 225; ''[[Webb v. O'Brien]]'', 263 US 313; and ''[[Frick v. Webb]]'', 263 US 326).

1. A California statute barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons "ineligible to citizenship," which classification included resident alien Japanese and precluded such a one from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of the State, held invalid under the Federal Constitution and laws. pp.&amp;nbsp;412–422.

2. For purposes of decision by this Court, it may be assumed that the object of the statute was to conserve fish in the coastal waters of the State, or to protect citizens of the State engaged in commercial fishing from the competition of Japanese aliens, or both. P. 418.

3. That the United States regulates immigration and naturalization in part on the basis of race and color classifications does not authorize adoption by a State of such classifications to prevent lawfully admitted aliens within its borders from earning a livelihood by means open to all other inhabitants. pp.&amp;nbsp;418–420.

4. The Fourteenth Amendment and federal laws, 8 U. S. C. § 41, embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide "in any state" on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws. pp.&amp;nbsp;419–420.

5. Whatever may be the interest of the State or its citizens in the fish in the 3-mile belt offshore, that interest does not justify the State in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all other persons to do so. pp.&amp;nbsp;420–421.

6. Assuming their continued validity, cases sustaining state laws barring land ownership by aliens ineligible to citizenship, which rested on grounds peculiar to real property, can not be extended to control the decision in this case. P. 422.

===Concurrence===
[[Frank Murphy|Justice Murphy]], joined by [[Wiley B. Rutledge|Rutledge]], expressed agreement with these views, but thought that the statute should also be condemned as being the direct outgrowth of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry and as having no relation whatever to any constitutionally cognizable interest of California.

===Dissent===
[[Stanley F. Reed|Justice Reed]], joined by [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], dissented on the ground that a state has the power to exclude all aliens from enjoyment of its natural resources, including its fisheries, and that a classification excluding such aliens as are ineligible to citizenship is not unreasonable.

'''Techsource''' involves the [[automation]], or conversion of a task or job from a manual task performed by a person, to a job performed entirely by machines. The concept of "techsourcing" has occurred across many industries for many years, however the phrase was coined by George Tosh, Principle Software Engineer for Salesforce in 2016.  Techsourcing might include the use of [[robotics]], or dedicated purpose-built machines to complete a task, but not always.

A popular example of techsourcing is the ATM or “[[Automated Teller Machine]]”. The ATM performs many of the tasks that human [[bank teller]]s performed. It has allowed banks and other financial institutions to increase customer satisfaction through decreased wait times, but often at the cost of job opportunities for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teach-ict.com/gcse_new/organisations/banking/miniweb/pg2.htm|title=Teach ICT - GCSE ICT - banking and ICT|website=www.teach-ict.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techsourcing usually occurs for jobs and roles that cannot be outsourced due to the specific nature of the job.

In 2015, and continuing into 2016, the push for a $15/hour minimum wage among many [[minimum wage]] earners has increased fears among [[economists]] that increasing the minimum wage will only lead to jobs being “techsourced”, automated, or eliminated entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/05/26/mcdonalds-ex-ceo-says-15-minimum-wage-would-lead-to-robots-and-automation-hes-right/#150611d57860|title=McDonald's Ex-CEO Is Right When He Says A $15 Minimum Wage Would Lead To Automation|last=Worstall|first=Tim|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that minimum wage jobs are not the only jobs at risk for being techsourced. In Belgium two hospitals have employed robots as receptionists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/345245/pepper-robot-lands-a-hospital-job|title=Pepper Robot Lands a Hospital Job|website=PCMAG|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offer directions and assist patients, jobs that previously would have been filled by humans.

==Background==

Barnard attended [[Harvard University]] between 1906 and 1909 where he majored in economics; however, he did not obtain a degree.&lt;ref name= Wolf1974&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Wolf | first1 = William B. | title = The Basic Barnard: an Introduction to Chester I.

Barnard | year = 1973 | publisher = [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University]] | location = Ithaca, NY | isbn = 087546047X }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} At New Jersey Bell, Barnard enjoyed "long hours of self-absorbed reflection and study."&lt;ref name=Hoopes2003&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoopes | first = James | title = False Prophets: the Gurus Who Created Modern Management and Why Their Ideas are Bad for Business Today | publisher = Perseus Publishing | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 2003 | isbn = 0738207985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}}

In 1936, Barnard gave a lecture at [[Princeton University]] entitled "Mind in Everyday Affairs."&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|19,92}} In the lecture, Barnard described the differences between "logical" and "non-logical" (i.e., "intuitional") mental processes.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|302}} He encouraged the use of non-logical processes "for many conditions and purposes."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|321}}

Barnard had many contacts with Harvard officials, for example in relation to fundraising activities.&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Wren | first1 = Daniel A. | last2 = Greenwood | first2 = Ronald G. | title = Management Innovators: the People and Ideas That Have Shaped Modern Business | year = 1998 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0195117050 | chapter = Chapter 8: Organizers | pages=155–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}} He and [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] were friends, and Henderson was a friend of [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], who had been president of Harvard and founder of the [[Lowell Institute]].&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|16–18}} Henderson suggested that Lowell invite Barnard to lecture at the Institute, and having read "Mind in Everyday Affairs" and another lecture by Barnard, Lowell did so.&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|18–21}} Barnard gave eight extemporaneous talks at the Lowell Institute in 1937 on the topic of "functions of the executive," and on the invitation of [[Dumas Malone]] (the director of [[Harvard University Press]] who met Barnard through [[Arthur W. Page]]), he revised the material from the talks to create the book.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|vii}}&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

Barnard's philosophy and thought processes in writing the book were characterized by [[humanism]], [[empiricism]], [[speculative philosophy]] (the interpretation of experience in a coherent framework), and analysis of the dichotomy of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|46–59}} As cited in the book, his intellectual influences included [[Arthur F. Bentley]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], Lawrence Joseph Henderson, [[Talcott Parsons]], [[W. H. R. Rivers]], [[Frederic Bartlett]], [[Elton Mayo]], [[Fritz Roethlisberger]], [[Mary Parker Follett]], [[James Harbord]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[John R. Commons]].&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|47,51,68,90,121,122,164,195,202}} His approach diverged from the "mechanistic conceptions" of Frederick Winslow Taylor and [[Henri Fayol]].&lt;ref name=Gabor2000/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Summary==

===Introduction to the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition===
In the 1968 edition, the Introduction by [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] evaluates the book and summarizes its place in the management literature. Andrews concludes that it is "the most thought-provoking book on organization and management ever written by a practicing executive."&lt;ref name=Barnard1968/&gt;{{rp|xxi}} He contrasts ''Functions of the Executive'' with the "classical" approaches to organizations found in books such as ''Principles of Management'' by [[Harold Koontz]] and [[Cyril J. O'Donnell]].&lt;ref name=Barnard1968/&gt;{{rp|xiv,xxii}}

===Preface===
Barnard gives an overview of his arguments in his Preface:&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|xi-xii}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Formally this work is divided into four parts, but in a sense it consists of two short treatises. One is an exposition of a theory of cooperation and organization and constitutes the first half of the book. The second is a study of the functions and of the methods of operation of executives in formal organizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Part I===
Part I is "Preliminary Considerations Concerning Cooperative Systems."

In '''Chapter I''', "Introduction" (pages 3–7), Barnard notes that "formal organization is that kind of cooperation among men that is conscious, deliberate, purposeful," and that "successful cooperation in or by formal organizations is the abnormal, not the normal, condition."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref name=Keon1986&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keon|first1=Thomas L.|title=The Functions of the Executive by Chester I. Barnard |journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=11|issue=2|year=1986|pages=456–459|doi=10.2307/258476}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|457}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = Joseph T. | title = Economic Foundations of Strategy | year = 2005 | publisher = SAGE | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn = 1-4129-0543-5 | chapter = Chapter 1: Behavioral Theory of the Firm | pages = 1–53 | url = http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/5029_Mahoney_Chapter_1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  An individual may belong to many formal organizations, some of which may be short-lived.

'''Chapter II''', "The Individual and Organization" (pages 8–15), states that individuals can be characterized in many ways (e.g., physical, social, psychological), but that for the purposes of discussion the book is concerned with the functional relationships among individuals in organizations. Barnard distinguishes between "effective" and "efficient" actions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a specific desired end is attained we shall say that the action is "effective." When the unsought consequences of the action are more important than the attainment of the desired end and are dissatisfactory, effective action, we shall say, is "inefficient." When the unsought consequences are unimportant or trivial, the action is "efficient."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name= Callender2009&gt;{{cite book | last = Callender | first = Guy | title = Efficiency and Management | publisher = Routledge | location = London and New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780415431804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The remaining chapters in Part I elaborate on the relationships among people in a "cooperative system":
* '''Chapter III''': "Physical and Biological Limitations in Cooperative Systems" (pages 22–37)
* '''Chapter IV''': "Psychological and Social Factors in Systems of Cooperation" (pages 38–45)
* '''Chapter V''': "The Principles of Cooperative Action" (pages 46–61)

===Part II===
The book's second part concerns "The Theory and Structure of Formal Organizations."

Pages 65–81 contain '''Chapter VI''', "The Definition of Formal Organization." In the chapter, Barnard defines "formal organization" twice as "a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces of two or more persons."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|73,81}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Copeland |first1= M. T. |title= The Job of an Executive |journal= Harvard Business Review |volume=18|date=Winter 1940|pages=159–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}}  The chapter outlines how Barnard developed the definition and explains that the concept of organization is abstract.  It specifies that a formal organization is part of a "cooperative system," a "complex of physical, biological, personal, and social components which are in a specific systematic relationship by reason of the cooperation of two or more persons for at least one definite end."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|149}}

'''Chapter VII''', "The Theory of Formal Organization" on pages 82–95, sets forth the three elements necessary for organizations: "(1) communication; (2) willingness to serve; and (3) common purpose."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|82}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Scott |first1= William G. |last2= Mitchell |first2= Terence R. |date= Spring 1987|title= The Universal Barnard: His Macro Theories of Organization|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=11 |issue=1 |pages= 34–58|jstor=40861334}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}} Barnard suggests both: (1) that an organization that cannot accomplish its purpose cannot survive, and (2) that an organization that accomplishes its purpose has no reason for existence. Therefore, organizations are constantly adopting new purposes.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|91}}

'''Chapter VIII''', "The Structure of Complex Formal Organizations" (pages 96–113), concerns the relationship of "superior" to "subordinate" organizations, the growth of organizations, and the relationship of small working "unit organizations" to "executive organizations" within complex formal organizations.

In '''Chapter IX''', "Informal Organizations and Their Relation to Formal Organizations" (pages 114-123), Barnard states that formal organizations coexist with informal organizations (groups of people who interact with each other outside a formal organizational structure).&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|151}}  Benefits of informal organizations include the promotion of communication, cohesiveness, and self-respect.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|122}}

===Part III===
Part III is titled "The Elements of Formal Organizations" and begins with '''Chapter X''' (pages 127-138) about "The Bases and Kinds of Specializations."

"The Economy of Incentives" is '''Chapter XI''' (pages 139-160). According to Barnard, "in all sorts of organizations the affording of adequate incentives becomes the most definitely emphasized task in their existence"&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|139}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|151}}  Specific inducements range from "material inducements" to "ideal benefactions" (e.g., "[[pride of workmanship]]"), while "general incentives" include "personal comfort in social relations."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|142–149}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005/&gt;{{rp|4}} Barnard's conclusions on incentives were drawn "almost entirely from observations… not from any reading."&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

'''Chapter XII''', "The Theory of Authority" (pages 161-184) is notable for its summary of the conditions for authoritative communications, its explanation of "zone of indifference," and its distinction between "authority of position" and "authority of leadership."
*Concerning authoritative communications, Barnard wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A person can and will accept a communication as authoritative only when four conditions simultaneously obtain: (a) he can and does understand the communication; (b) ''at the time of his decision'' he believes that it is not inconsistent with the purpose of the organization; (c) ''at the time of his decision'', he believes it to be compatible with his personal interest as a whole; and (d) he is able mentally and physically to comply with it.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|165}}&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998/&gt;{{rp|167–168}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Barnard discusses the concept of "zone of indifference," which is "perhaps the most well-known idea in the book," as follows:&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005/&gt;{{rp|5}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;...there exists a "zone of indifference" in each individual within which orders are acceptable without conscious questioning of their authority… The zone of indifference will be wider or narrower depending upon the degree to which the inducements exceed the burdens and sacrifices which determine the individual's adhesion to the organization. It follows that the range of orders that will be accepted will be very limited among those who are barely induced to contribute to the system.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|167–169}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*"Authority of position" is explained as occurring when people "impute authority to communications from superior positions… to a considerable extent independent of the personal ability of the incumbent of the position." In contrast, people with superior ability have "authority of leadership." When a person has both types of authority, the subordinate will "accept[] orders far outside the zone of indifference."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|173–174}}&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998/&gt;{{rp|168}}

In '''Chapter XIII''', "The Environment of Decision" (pages 185-199), Barnard contemplates how personal decision-making and organizational decision-making differ.  He states "The fine art of executive decision consists in not deciding questions that are not now pertinent, in not deciding prematurely, in not making decision that cannot be made effective, and in not making decisions that others should make."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|194}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|152}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahoney|first1=Joseph T.|title=The Relevance of Chester I.

Part III concludes with '''Chapter XIV''', "The Theory of Opportunism" (pages 200-211).

===Part IV===
"The Functions of Organizations in Cooperative Systems" constitutes the final part of the book.  It begins with '''Chapter XV''' ("The Executive Functions," pages 215-234) and '''Chapter XVI''' ("The Executive Process," pages 235-257).

'''Chapter XVII''' on "The Nature of Executive Responsibility" (pages 258-284) discusses [[morality]]. Barnard observes that "cooperation, not leadership, is the creative process; but leadership is the indispensable fulminator of its forces."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|259}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2002/&gt;{{rp|166}} In turn, morality is critical to leadership: "organizations endure… in proportion to the breadth of the morality by which they are governed."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|282}}&lt;ref name= Gabor2000/&gt;{{rp|82}}

The "Conclusion" ('''Chapter XVIII''', pages 285-296) highlights 16 major observations of the book and contemplates the relationship of science and art in management:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the expansion of cooperation and the development of the individual are mutually dependent realities, and that a due proportion or balance between them is a necessary condition of human welfare. Because it is subjective with respect both to a society as a whole and to the individual, what this proportion is I believe science cannot say. It is a question for philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2002/&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Appendix===
The Appendix (pages 301-322) contains the text of Barnard's 1936 "Mind in Everyday Affairs" lecture.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of the book include:
* It is "deadly… [with] little meaning today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=John A. |title=A Classic Business Bookshelf|journal=BusinessWeek|date=March 5, 1990|url= http://www.businessweek.com/1989-94/pre94/b31481.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Its prose has been characterized as "difficult to read," "heavy," "turbid," and "atrocious."&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=Hoopes2003/&gt;{{rp|174–175}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|150}} Even the Introduction to the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition notes the "ponderousness of Barnard's style."&lt;ref name=Barnard1968/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}
* The definition of "efficiency" in Chapter II is confusing.&lt;ref name= Callender2009/&gt;{{rp|13,194}}
* The definition of "formal organization" in Chapter VI has been subject to considerable scrutiny. Although [[Hal G. Rainey]] acknowledged that the definition did distinguish Barnard from the "classical theorists" of management, he characterized it as "completely inadequate."&lt;ref name=Rainey1991/&gt;{{rp|276}} [[Lyndall Urwick]] stated that "boy kisses girl" could qualify as an organization under Barnard's definition.&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998/&gt;{{rp|166}}
* Statements such as "Personal aversions based upon racial, national, color, and class differences often seem distinctly pernicious; but on the whole they are, in the immediate sense, I believe, based upon a sound feeling of organization necessities" (page 147) have been assessed as "unenlightened" by today's standards.&lt;ref name=DunphyHoopes2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunphy|first1=Steven M.|last2=Hoopes|first2=James|title=Chester Barnard: Member of the "Élite"?|journal=Management Decision|volume=40|issue=10|year=2002|pages=1024–1028|doi=10.1108/00251740210452881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Barnard's ideas about authority in Chapter XII have been summarized as a "bottom-up power" theory that fails to acknowledge the reality that it is "sometimes the job of corporate leaders to use power to control, repress, and arrest the actions of their subordinates."&lt;ref name=Hoopes2003/&gt;{{rp|xxiv,175–177,273–277}}
* A passage on page 319 ("…It is consequently necessary to say things in a form which is not correct from the standpoint of the speaker or writer…") has been interpreted as "advocating lying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frederick | first = William Crittenden | title = Values, Nature, and Culture in the American Corporation | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 0195357159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130–131}}
* Barnard did not write in any detail about the relationship between an organization and the customers of that organization.&lt;ref name=Keon1986/&gt;{{rp|458}}
* The book does not consider how an executive of a corporation interacts with the board of directors or stockholders.&lt;ref name=Keon1986/&gt;{{rp|458}}
* There is no significant mention of the education of staff (i.e., the executive's role as a teacher).&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|156–157}}

==Legacy==

[[File:The Functions of the Executive - Cover of 30th Anniversary Edition 1968.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 30th Anniversary Edition (1968)]]''The Functions of the Executive'' was to be the only book that Barnard ever wrote; however, he also wrote articles for journals, and collections of such articles have been published in books (e.g., the 1948 book ''Organization and Management'').&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|vii}} By 2010, the book had received over 8,000 citations in [[Google Scholar]].&lt;ref name=GaborMahoney2010&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.business.uiuc.edu/Working_Papers/papers/10-0102.pdf |title= Chester Barnard and the Systems Approach to Nurturing Organizations | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], [[UIUC College of Business|College of Business]] | series= Working Paper 10-0102 |author1=Gabor, Andrea |author2=Joseph T.

* ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' by [[Herbert A. Simon]] (1947).&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mitchell |first1= Terence R. |last2= Scott |first2= William G. |date= Fall 1988|title= The Barnard-Simon Contribution: a Vanished Legacy|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=12 |issue=3 |pages= 348–368|jstor=40861427}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Golembiewski |first1= Robert T. |year=1988 |title= Nobel Laureate Simon 'Looks Back': a Low-Frequency Mode |journal= Public Administration Quarterly |volume= 12|issue=3 |pages=275–300 |jstor= 40861423 |url=http://octopus.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00069/fld05320/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted to him; science is a cumulative endeavor. My general debt is expressed in the acknowledgements [p. xivii of the Second Edition]: "To Mr. Charles [sic] I. Barnard I owe a special debt: first, for his own book ''The Functions of the Executive''.…" In the book itself there are fourteen references to Barnard…. the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard…. What I would now regard as the principal novelties in {{sic|''Administative''}} ''Behavior'' are the development of the concept of organizational identification…, the description of the decision process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the bounded rationality notions…. Most of the rest is highly "Barnardian," and certainly even those "novel" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of organizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''The Human Group'' by [[George C. Homans]] (1950).
* ''The Human Side of Enterprise'' by [[Douglas McGregor]] (1960).
* ''New Patterns of Management'' by [[Rensis Likert]] (1961).
* ''[[Behavioral theory of the firm|A Behavioral Theory of the Firm]]'' by [[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]] (1963).
* ''Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications'' by [[Oliver E. Williamson]] (1975).
Barnard's book also anticipated ''[[In Search of Excellence]]'' by [[Tom Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman, Jr.]], the concept of [[management by objectives]] that [[Peter Drucker]] popularized, the [[two-factor theory]] of [[Frederick Herzberg]], and [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]].&lt;ref name=Gabor2000/&gt;{{rp|79–80}}

Examples of papers that have examined Barnard's "zones of indifference" concept include:
* A 1994 textual analysis of Barnard's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Golembiewski|first1=Robert T.|last2=Kuhnert|first2=Karl W.|title=Barnard on Authority and Zone of Indifference: Toward Perspectives on the Decline of Managerialism|journal=International Journal of Public Administration|volume=17|issue=6|year=1994|pages=1195–1238|doi=10.1080/01900699408524939}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2000 psychological study that compared leaders' and followers' ratings of the followers' willingness to perform assignments from the leaders. Leaders rated the assignments as "less enjoyable, undesirable, more above the call of duty, and more likely to be resisted" than the followers reported.&lt;ref name=Barbuto2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbuto|first1=John E.|title=Comparing Leaders' Ratings to Targets' Self-Reported Resistance to Task Assignments: an Extension of Chester Barnard's Zones of Indifference|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=86|issue=2|year=2000|pages=611–621|doi=10.2466/PR0.86.2.611-621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2001 qualitative study that examined how workplaces might have wider or narrower zones of indifference concerning the rights of employees infected with [[HIV]] under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref name= Slack2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Slack |first1= James D. |title= Zones of Indifference and the American Workforce: the Case of Persons with HIV/AIDS|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=25|issue=3|year=2001|pages=247–269|jstor=40861841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1961, the book had sold over 35,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|1}} As of 1982, the book had gone through 29 printings, and the Thirtieth Anniversary edition is still in print.&lt;ref name=HUP/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=William G.|title=Barnard on the Nature of Elitist Responsibility|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=42|issue=3|year=1982|pages=197–201|doi=10.2307/976004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been translated into many languages, including Arabic,&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|1}} Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnard | first = Chester | title = Jing Li Ren Yuan De Zhi Neng| language= Chinese | publisher = Ji Xie Gong Ye Chu Ban She| location =Beijing | year = 2007| isbn = 9787111217978}}&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnard | first = Chester | title =Die Führung großer Organisationen | language= German | publisher = Girardet| location =Essen | year =1970 | oclc = 174906430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnard | first = Chester | title = Tafḳide Ha-Menahel| language= Hebrew | publisher =Yaḥdaṿ | location =Tel Aviv | year =1970 | oclc = 19156236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnard | first = Chester | title =Le Funzioni del Dirigente.

In 1988, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] held a series of seminars to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book's publication; eight of the lectures became essays in a 1995 book edited by Oliver E.

Although an informal advisory panel voted ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' by Herbert Simon the most influential 1940–1990 book in academic public administration, "panel members had a tendency to associate Simon and Barnard," and one panel member wrote that Barnard's book was "the truly seminal work."&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt; ''The Functions of the Executive'' appeared in at least four lists of "best" or "most influential" management and business books between 2001 and 2011.&lt;ref name=BedeianWren2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crainer | first = Stuart | author-link = Stuart Crainer| title = The Ultimate Business Library: the Greatest Books That Made Management | publisher = Capstone Pub | edition = 3rd| location = Oxford | year = 2003 | isbn = 1841120596 | chapter = Chester Barnard, ''The Functions of the Executive'' (1938) | pages = 15–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businesspundit.com/25-best-business-books-ever/ |title= 25 Best Business Books Ever |author= Knufken, Drea |date= July 31, 2008 |work="Business Pundit" blog |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Best Business Books Ever: the Most Influential Management Books You'll Never Have Time to Read | year = 2011 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 9780465022366 | edition = 2nd | pages = 55–56 | chapter = ''The Functions of the Executive'' by Chester Barnard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The a2 Milk Company is the successor of A2 Corporation Limited, a New Zealand company founded in 2000 by [[Corran McLachlan|Dr Corran McLachlan]], who was researching health effects of A1 beta-casein; and Howard Paterson who was one of New Zealand's richest men, a significant dairy farmer, and an important stakeholder in [[Fonterra]], a [[Agricultural cooperative|dairy cooperative]].&lt;ref name=FourCorners /&gt;&lt;ref name="A2 protein milk supply on horizon"/&gt; The company commercialised a [[genetic test]] to determine whether a [[cow]] will produce milk without the A1 protein, and to market a2 Milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 31 March 2003 [http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/transcripts/s820943.htm Transcript of "White Mischief"], [http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/20030331_white_mischief/ an episode] of ''Four Corners'', an investigative journalism series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2 protein milk supply on horizon"&gt;Staff, New Zealand Herald. 14 May 2001 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=188650 A2 protein milk supply on horizon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truswell"&gt;{{Citation |last=Truswell |first=A.S. |title=The A2 milk case: a critical review |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=623–631 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602104 |pmid=15867940 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n5/full/1602104a.html |accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, A2 Corporation focused on dairy farm [[breeding program]]s to develop herds that would produce only a2 milk.&lt;ref name="landline" /&gt;  However the launch of a2 milk was delayed by opposition from Fonterra, which had protected contracts under New Zealand law with about 98% of New Zealand dairy farms.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Smith for Just-food.  2 July 2003 [http://www.just-food.com/analysis/a2-milk-launched-as-controversy-churns-on_id93493.aspx A2 milk launched as controversy churns on]&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking leverage in the battle with Fonterra over access to farmers, and over patent rights,&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt; Paterson led the company into litigation against Fonterra, asking the New Zealand High Court to order Fonterra to put health warnings on its conventional milk concerning risks of type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia due to the presence of A1 beta-casein, and to force Fonterra to publicly disclose all the information it had about the links between A1 beta-casein and health risks.&lt;ref name=Litigation&gt;Deborah Hill Cone for Share Chat 1 November 2002 [http://www.sharechat.co.nz/article/4d8b820a/a2-accuses-dairy-giant-of-suppressing-milk-defects.html A2 accuses dairy giant of suppressing milk defects] Quote: "The lawsuit risks inflicting catastrophic damage to New Zealand's international reputation and foreign earnings as Fonterra turns over $14 billion and makes 20% of the country's total offshore receipts. As if that would not be enough of a PR disaster as the country tries to maintain its position as a clean, green food producer...."&lt;/ref&gt; The litigation threatened New Zealand's economy and international reputation as at the time Fonterra was responsible for 20% of New Zealand's exports.&lt;ref name=Litigation/&gt;  The press over the litigation and public concern over the claims of A2 Corporation led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Health and the [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] to issue statements confirming the safety of conventional milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/20030331_white_mischief/statement.pdf Supporting documents for "White Mischief" story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Minister&gt;Office of the Minister of Food Safety, New Zealand Food Safety Authority. 27 November 2007 [http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Milk_Arrangements-Advises_Cabinet.pdf A1-A2 Milk: Arrangements for Upcoming Reviews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821101932/http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Milk_Arrangements-Advises_Cabinet.pdf |date=21 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A2 Corporation was able to obtain agreements with enough dairy farmers to launch A2 milk in New Zealand at the end of April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Stock Exchange. [https://www.nzx.com/markets/NZSX/securities/ATM/analysis a2 Milk Company Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of 2003, both founders of the company died.

Slorach, "Food safety risk management in New Zealand", page 14.]&lt;/ref&gt; By end of 2003 the weakened A2 Corporation had withdrawn the litigation against Fonterra and negotiations had resumed.&lt;ref name=AR2003&gt;A2 Corporation [http://globaldocuments.morningstar.com/documentlibrary/document/4a3ab72822c96213.msdoc/original A2 Annual Report for Year Ending March 2003].  Note: Report was apparently published at the end of 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=liquidates/&gt;

The company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] in October&lt;ref name=liquidates/&gt; and was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="landline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=liquidates&gt;Shelley Lloyd for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 17 November 2004 [http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/qld/stories/s1245678.htm A2 milk liquidates]&lt;/ref&gt; A $1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Finance_and_Public_Administration/Completed%20inquiries/2004-07/reg_partner_prog/index Australian Senate finance and public administration references committee report on Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, October 2005, pages xiv, 97–100]&lt;/ref&gt; A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A2 herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.&lt;ref name="landline" /&gt;

In December, A2 Corporation sold its interests in A2 Australia to [[Fraser &amp; Neave]], a [[food marketing]] giant in Asian markets, for about $1.1 million.  A2 Corporation had lost about $1.3 million for 2004, the same as it has lost the year before; the sale allowed A2 Corporation to rely on Fraser &amp; Neave to build the Australian and Asian businesses.&lt;ref name=QuickSale&gt;Ellen Read for the New Zealand Herald. 30 December 2004 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=9004964 Quick sale likely for A2 Corp]&lt;/ref&gt; A2 Corporation focused on recovering from the deaths of its founders organizationally and financially, relied on its New Zealand licensees to develop the New Zealand market, and turned its focus to developing overseas markets.&lt;ref name=QuickSale/&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006, A2 Corporation business continued to grow. [[Dairy Australia]], the national association of the Australian dairy industry, and market competitors like [[Parmalat]] in response have consistently stated that there is no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest A1 proteins are dangerous and have warned that criticism of normal milk is damaging the entire dairy industry.&lt;ref name="landline"&gt;{{cite web |last=Courtney |first=Pip | author-link = Pip Courtney |title=The A2 milk story |work=Landline |publisher=ABC Television |date=6 August 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1702999.htm |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Peter |title=A2 attacks milk |newspaper=The Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=3 |date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Simone |title=It's a matter of genetics |newspaper=The Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=107 |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rival"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Mark |title=Rival watering down A2 Milk claims |newspaper=The Age |location=Melbourne |pages=8, 28–29 |date=24 May 2014 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/rival-seeks-to-water-down-a2-milk-claims-20140523-38uef.html |accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Binsted |first=Tim |title=Parmalat boss hits out at A2 |newspaper=Australian Financial Review |page=8 |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconsolidation and succession as The a2 Milk Company ===

In 2006, A2 Corporation was on sound enough footing to buy back A2 Australia from Fraser &amp; Neave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10376408| title=A2 set to buy back Australian unit| date=6 April 2006| publisher=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, it lost about $1 million, after having lost $9 million the year before, but revenues had approximately doubled.  In that year it warned shareholders not to expect profit for another three years.&lt;ref name="landline"/&gt;

Commercial development proceeded, and by 2010 some 40 million litres of a2 Milk were being produced by 12,000 A2-certified cows across Australia, with milk processed at four plants in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland,&lt;ref name="simonegenetics"&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Simone |title=It's a matter of genetics |newspaper=Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=107 |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yoghurt made with a2 Milk went on the market in Australia in April 2010.&lt;ref name=Formula&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Christopher |title=A2 gets ready to launch baby formula |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |location=Auckland |date=10 September 2013 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11121927 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 A2 Corporation announced it had a made a profit over a half-year for the first time; in the six months ending 31 December 2010, it made a net $894,000, or 17 cents/share.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation Press Release 18 February 2011 [http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/a2-corp-declares-a-maiden-profit/ A2 Corp Declares a Maiden Profit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120543/http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/a2-corp-declares-a-maiden-profit/ |date=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 A2 Corporation announced it would attempt to raise $20 million and list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange main board,&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Bond for the National Business Review. 5 December 2012 [http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/a2-corp-sets-sights-nzx-20-million-equity-raising-gb-133540 A2 Corp sets sights on NZX with $20 million equity raising]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would use the funds to grow its Chinese infant formula and UK milk businesses.

In 2015, a2 Milk whole milk powder and a2 Milk Ice Cream products were launched.&lt;ref name="2015pres"&gt;{{cite web |title=FY Results Presentation 2015 |url=https://www.thea2milkcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FY-Results-Presentation-2015.pdf |website=The a2 Milk Company |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2014–2015 Financial year, The a2 Milk Company reported its Australian and New Zealand segment revenue grew by 40% vs pcp; and sales on a2 infant formula increased by 650%.&lt;ref name="2015pres"/&gt;

In December 2017 the company announced that in the summer of 2018 Geoffrey Babidge, who had been nearing retirement age, would step down and [[Jayne Hrdlicka]] would take over as CEO; at that time she was CEO of [[Jetstar Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand's A2 Milk names Jayne Hrdlicka as CEO |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/a2-milk-company-ceo/new-zealands-a2-milk-names-jayne-hrdlicka-as-ceo-idUSL4N1OD095 |work=Reuters |date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took over in July 2018.

a2 claims that milk containing A1 proteins are harmful, but a 2009 [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) review of scientific literature found there was insufficient evidence to prove that bioactive peptides in A1 milk have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=European Food Safety Authority |title=Review of the potential health impact of β-casomorphins and related peptides |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=231r |date=3 February 2009 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2009.231r |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/231r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[casein|A1 and A2 beta-casein]] are [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] of the beta-casein milk protein that differ by one [[amino acid]]. The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow's milk in Europe (excluding France), the USA, Australia and New Zealand. A genetic test, developed by the A2 Milk Company, determines whether a cow produces the A2 or A1 type protein in its milk. The test allows the a2 Milk Company to license milk producers once proven their cows produce only A2 beta-casein protein in their milk, to the exclusion of the A1 beta-casein protein type.&lt;ref name=EFSA/&gt;

==Intellectual property==
A2 Corporation licensed patents filed in the 1990s by the New Zealand Dairy Board, and filed its own patents on [[genetic tests]] to determine what form of beta-casein cows produce in milk, and concerning potential adverse health consequences of A1 milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt;&lt;ref name="truswell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/EP0789842A1?cl=zh EP0789842A1 Google patents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Stevenson for the New Zealand Herald. 21 December 2000 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=165973 A2 Corp pays $8m for milk patent rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 A2 Corporation had developed a worldwide suite of intellectual property, including trademarks, trade secrets, and patents covering products, the genetic test and methods to develop A2 producing herds, as well as methods to check the protein content and fatty acid content of milk, [[dietary supplements]] with A2 beta-casein, and even therapeutic uses of A2.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Babidge, Managing Director &amp; CEO of A2 Corp.

The a2 Milk Company continues to develop a portfolio of intellectual property, including trademarks and patents. The a2 Milk Company also invests in targeted research and development associated with the benefits of the A2 protein.&lt;ref name="2015pres"/&gt; In September 2017, It was reported that A2 Milk got approval to keep selling its products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/a2-milk-gets-china-tick-of-approval-20170928-gyqe3k.html|title=A2 Milk gets China tick of approval|last=Gray|first=Darren|date=2017-09-28|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tobacco}}

The '''tobacco industry''' comprises those persons and companies engaged in the growth, preparation for sale, shipment, advertisement, and distribution of [[tobacco]] and tobacco-related products. It is a global industry; tobacco can grow in any warm, moist environment, which means it can be farmed on all continents except [[Antarctica]].

Tobacco, one of the most widely used addictive substances in the world{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, is a plant native to the Americas and historically one of the half-dozen most important crops grown by American farmers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} More specifically, tobacco refers to any of various plants of the genus ''[[Nicotiana]]'' (especially ''[[Nicotiana tabacum|N. tabacum]]'') native to [[tropical]] America and widely cultivated for their leaves, which are dried and processed chiefly for smoking in [[Tobacco pipe|pipe]]s, [[cigarette]]s, and [[cigar]]s; it is also cut to form [[chewing tobacco]] or ground to make [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] or dipping tobacco, as well as other less common preparations. From 1617 to 1793 tobacco was the most valuable staple export from the English American mainland colonies and the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Until the 1960s, the United States not only grew but also manufactured and exported more tobacco than any other country.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Tobacco is an agricultural [[commodity]] product, [[Agricultural economics|similar in economic terms]] to agricultural [[food]]stuffs: the price is in part determined by crop yields, which vary depending on local weather conditions.  The price also varies by specific [[species]] or [[cultivar]] grown, the total quantity on the market ready for sale, the area where it is grown, the health of the plants, and other characteristics individual to product quality.

Since 1964 conclusive medical evidence of the deadly effects of tobacco consumption has led to a sharp decline in official support for producers and manufacturers of tobacco, although it contributes to the agricultural, fiscal, manufacturing, and exporting sectors of the economy. Laws around the world now often have some restrictions on smoking, but almost 6 trillion cigarettes are still produced each year, representing over a 12% increase since the year 2000.&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/industry/manufacturing/text/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524045738/http://tobaccoatlas.org/industry/manufacturing/text/ |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |title=Manufacturing Cigarettes |deadurl=yes |publisher=[[World Lung Foundation]] and [[American Cancer Society]] |accessdate=June 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; China accounts for over 40% of current world production.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt; Tobacco is often heavily taxed to gain revenues for governments and as an incentive for people not to smoke.&lt;ref name="whotax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/downloads/doc_download/2381-chapter-28-tobacco-prices-and-taxes.html |title=Tobacco Prices and Taxes |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of tobacco}}
For a history of how tobacco has been grown and marketed, see [[tobacco]], [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and articles on similar topics.

==Position of industry ==
The phrase "tobacco industry" generally refers to the [[company|companies]] involved in the manufacture of [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], chewing tobacco and [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] tobacco. [[China National Tobacco Co.]] has become the largest tobacco company in the world by volume. Following extensive merger and acquisition activity in the 1990s and 2000s, four firms dominate international markets - in alphabetical order:

* [[Altria]] formerly [[Philip Morris Cos.]]
* [[British American Tobacco]] 
* [[Imperial Tobacco]]
* [[Japan Tobacco]]
*

Altria, formerly called the [[Philip Morris Cos.]] (Philip Morris Companies Inc.), still owns the Philip Morris tobacco business in the United States, but Philip Morris International has been fully independent since 2008. In most countries these companies either have long-established dominance, or have purchased the major domestic producer or producers (often a former [[state monopoly]]). Until 2014 the United States had one other substantial independent firm, [[Lorillard]], which Reynolds American, Inc. acquired. India has its own major player, [[ITC Limited]] (25.4%-owned by British American Tobacco). A small{{quantify|date=November 2015}} number of state monopolies survive, as well as some small independent firms.

[[Tobacco advertising]] is becoming increasingly restricted by the governments of countries around the world citing health issues as a reason to restrict tobaccos appeal{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Industry outlook in the United States==

{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

[[File:Smoking Dangers - 1905 new.png|thumb|left|180px|Anti-smoking ad, 1905]]

The tobacco industry in the United States has suffered greatly since the mid-1990s, when it was successfully sued by several U.S. states. The suits claimed that tobacco causes cancer, that companies in the industry knew this, and that they deliberately understated the significance of their findings, contributing to the illness and death of many citizens in those states.

The industry was found to have decades of [[Legacy Tobacco Documents Library|internal memos]] confirming in detail that tobacco (which contains [[nicotine]]) is both [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] and [[carcinogen]]ic (cancer-causing). The industry had long denied that [[nicotine addiction|nicotine is addictive]].&lt;ref name=Glantz2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glantz|first=SA|title=The truth about big tobacco in its own words|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=321|issue=7257|pages=313–314|date=August 2000|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7257/313|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7257.313|pmc=1118313|pmid=10926570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suit resulted in a [[Master Settlement Agreement|large cash settlement]] being paid by a group of tobacco companies to the states that sued. Further, since the suit was settled, other individuals have come forth, in [[class action]] [[lawsuit]]s, claiming individual damages. New suits of this nature will probably continue for a long time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Since the settlement is a heavy tax on the profits of the tobacco industry in the US, regressive against smokers, and further settlements being made only add to the financial burden of these companies, it is debatable if the industry has a money-producing long term outlook.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The tobacco industry has historically been largely successful in this litigation process, with the majority of cases being won by the industry. During the first 42 years of tobacco litigation (between 1954 and 1996) the industry maintained a clean record in litigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daynard | first1 = RA | last2 = Bates | first2 = C | last3 = Francey | first3 = N | year = 2000 | title = Tobacco litigation worldwide | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7227| pages = 111–3 | pmid = 10625272 | pmc=1117367 | doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7227.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to tactics described in a [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] internal memo as "the way we won these cases, to paraphrase [[George S. Patton|Gen. Patton]], is not by spending all of Reynolds' money, but by making the other son of a bitch spend all of his."&lt;ref&gt;Haines v Liggett Group, Inc, 818 F Supp 414, 421 (DNJ 1993), quoted in Daynard et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 2005 only 59% of cases were won by the tobacco industry either outright or on appeal in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Douglas CE, Davis RM, Beasley JK. [http://tc.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/15/suppl_4/iv9 Epidemiology of the third wave of tobacco litigation in the United States, 1994–2005]. ''Tobacco Control'' 2006;15(suppl_4):iv9-iv16; {{doi|10.1136/tc.2006.016725}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the continued success of the industry's efforts to win these cases is questionable. In Florida, the industry has lost 77 of the 116 "Engle progeny" cases that have gone to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Craver, Winston-Salem Journal, 24 June 2014 [http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/national_international/reynolds-loses-another-engle-case-in-florida/article_edb613a2-fc05-11e3-8257-001a4bcf6878.html Reynolds loses another "Engle" case in Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has
also denied the industry's major grounds for appeal of Engle cases.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Nohlgren, Tampa Bay Times, 24 June 2014 [http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/us-supreme-court-sides-against-big-tobacco-in-florida-litigation/2183646  U.S. Supreme Court sides against Big Tobacco in Florida litigation ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] which has been called a "sweeping anti-smoking" bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31481823/ns/politics-white_house/ |title=Obama signs sweeping anti-smoking bill - politics - White House - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other restrictions, this Act banned the use of any constituent, additive, herb or spice that adds a "characterizing flavor" to the tobacco product or smoke (Section 907)(a)(1)(A).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1256enr.txt.pdf|title=FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this ban is to prevent children and teenagers from becoming addicted to cigarettes at a young age with the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] citing that "studies have shown that 17 year old
smokers are three times as likely to use flavored cigarettes as are smokers over the age of 25".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Questions and Answers on the Ban of Cigarettes that Contain Certain Characterizing Flavors|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/FlavoredTobacco/UCM183230.pdf|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|agency=US Food and Drug Administration|date=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban however does not apply to [[menthol cigarette]]s, which are exempt from the bill.

Lawsuits against the tobacco industry are primarily restricted to the United States due to differences in legal systems in other countries. Many businesses class ongoing lawsuits as a cost of doing business in the US and feel their revenue will be only marginally affected by the activities.

[[Big Tobacco|Large tobacco companies]] have entered the [[electronic cigarette#History|electronic cigarette]] market by either buying some of the small e-cigarette companies or by starting their own e-cigarette companies.&lt;ref name=Orellana-BarriosPayne2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orellana-Barrios|first1=Menfil A.|last2=Payne|first2=Drew|last3=Mulkey|first3=Zachary|last4=Nugent|first4=Kenneth|title=Electronic Cigarettes—A Narrative Review for Clinicians|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=128|issue=7|year=2015|pages=674–681|issn=0002-9343|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.01.033|pmid=25731134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco control==
On May 11, 2004, the U.S. became the 108th country to sign the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|Global Treaty on Tobacco Control]]. This treaty places broad restrictions on the sale, advertising, shipment, and taxation of tobacco products. The U.S. has not yet ratified this treaty in its [[United States Senate|senate]] and does not yet have a schedule for doing so.

Most recently, there has been discussion within the tobacco control community of transforming the tobacco industry through the replacement of tobacco [[corporation]]s by other types of business organizations that can be established to provide tobacco to the market while not attempting to increase market demand.&lt;ref&gt;C. Callard, D. Thompson and N. Collishaw, Curing The Addiction To Profits: A Supply-Side Approach To Phasing Out Tobacco (Ottawa: Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2007, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Altria Group]] (formerly Philip Morris) did not have to pay $79.5 million in punitive damages awarded to Mayola Williams in a 1999 Oregon court ruling, when she sued Phillip Morris for responsibility in the cancer death of her husband, Jesse Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17239146/ |title=Supreme Court throws out Philip Morris verdict - Business - US business - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court's decision overturns a ruling made by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] that upheld the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003687.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204130206/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003687.php |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2008, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out a $800 billion class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of a group or class of people who smoked light cigarettes. The plaintiffs' lawyers were confident that they would be able to win this suit due to the success of the Schwab case &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=14138|title=US: Tobacco Makers Lose Key Ruling on Latest Suites|author=Johnston, David Kay and Melanie Warner|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-09-26|accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein tobacco companies were found guilty of fraud-like charges because they were selling the idea that light cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. The ruling by the three-judge panel will not allow the suit to be pursued as a class, but instead need proof for why individual smokers chose light cigarettes over regular cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/business/03cnd-tobacco.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title=Suit on Light Cigarettes Is Thrown Out|author=Saul, Stephanie|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-04-03|accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco industry in popular culture==

The tobacco industry has had a long relationship with the entertainment industry. In silent era movies, back-lit smoke was often used by filmmakers to create sense of mystery and sensuality in a scene. Later, cigarettes were deliberately placed in the hands of Hollywood stars as an early phase of [[product placement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C Mekemson1, S A Glantz2 |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/suppl_1/i81.full |title=How the tobacco industry built its relationship with Hollywood - Mekemson and Glantz 11 (suppl 1): i81 - Tobacco Control |publisher=Tobaccocontrol.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; until health regulating bodies tightened rules on tobacco advertisement and anti-smoking groups pressured actors and studio executives against such tactics. [[Big Tobacco]] has since been the subject focus of films such as the [[docudrama]] ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' (1999) and ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You For Smoking]]'' (2005).

These issues have also constituted a recurring storyline in the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[Mad Men]]'', from [[Mad Men (season 1)|season 1]] beginning with the pilot episode ([[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (Mad Men)|"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"]]) through season 7's midseason finale, [[Mad Men (season 7)|"Waterloo"]]. In another television show, the [[Netflix]] original program [[List of Orange Is the New Black episodes#Season 2 .282014.29|''Orange Is the New Black'' season 2]], episode 2 ("Looks Blue, Tastes Red"), "[[List of characters from Orange Is the New Black#Inmates|Black Cindy]] bring[s] some [[Ralph Nader|Naderism]] to Lichtfield (a women's federal penitentiary) when talking about [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]: 'Nah they ain't so bad.

The employer or the employee often does so for [[tax evasion]] or avoiding or violating other laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the "Shadow Economy"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working contract is made without [[social security]] costs, and does typically not provide [[health insurance]], paid [[parental leave]], paid [[vacation]] or [[pension fund]]s. It is a part of what has been called the [[underground economy]], [[shadow economy]], [[black market]] or the non-observed economy. 

Payments are generally in cash, and the employer often does not check the employee's background or [[credential]]s, as is sometimes required by law or otherwise expected by the industry's client base, such as a [[license]] or [[professional certification]].

While the hiring of the employee may or may not be legal in itself, it is often done when the employer or the employee intentionally fails to obey one or more laws.

In [[developed country|developed nations]], unreported employment evades [[withholding tax]] and is part of the [[informal sector]]. It is hidden from the state for tax, social security, or labor law purposes but is legal in all other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feige |first=Edgar L. |title=Defining And Estimating Underground And Informal Economies: The New Institutional Economics Approach |journal=[[World Development (journal)|World Development]] |volume=18 |issue=7|date=December 11, 2003 | doi = 10.1016/0305-750x(90)90081-8 |pages=989–1002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Commodified World?: Mapping the limits of capitalism|author=Colin C.

==Common jobs==
Common types of [[employment]] sectors of unreported jobs include the following:
*[[Domestic worker|Domestic work]], such as [[homemaking|housekeeping]], [[babysitting]], or [[foodservice]]
*[[Construction worker|Construction work]], [[landscaping]], [[farmworker|farm work]]
*[[Taxicab]] service (sometimes known as [[illegal taxicab operation|hacking]])
*Various types of [[self-employment]], such as [[plumber|plumbing]], [[electrician]], [[window cleaner|window cleaning]], [[house painter and decorator|painting and decorating]], [[street market|street market trading]], and [[gardener|gardening]]
*Short-term work and day laborers
*Short-term youth employment
*[[wikt:barback|Barbacking]] and restaurant work.
*[[Human trafficking]]
*[[Prostitution]]
*Fixing cars, motorcycles, and mopeds

==Reasons==

Reasons one may work or pay a worker cash-in-hand include:
*Avoidance of wage [[garnishment]] or payment of [[child support]] or [[alimony]]
*Cheaper workforce and avoidance of [[minimum wage]] laws
*Convenience for both parties
*Elimination of paperwork, bookkeeping, and regulation compliance
*Reduced/eliminated expenses or need for bookkeepers, human resource specialists, lawyers, accountants, payroll services, insurance agents and other employment specialists
*Not checking or showing a [[criminal record]]
*Protesting actions or policies of the governing authorities (see [[agorism]])
*Evasion of [[insurance]] requirements
*Flexibility in hiring short-term employees without excessive overhead or paperwork
*Avoid allowable income limits by a person receiving certain benefits, such as [[unemployment benefits|unemployment]], [[social security disability|disability]], or [[public assistance]]
*[[Fugitive]], [[illegal immigration]], or [[organized crime]]
*[[Tax noncompliance]], [[tax resistance]], or [[social security]] evasion
* Ability to hire employees according to personal traits not related to suitability for employment (eg gender, sexuality, ethnic/religious affiliations etc)
* Ability to hire those who were formerly qualified, and still potentially able to do the job -- eg blacklisted, disbarred, forced retirement, struck off, etc

==Disadvantages==
Unreported employment can have harmful effects on government, employers, and employees.

Unreported employment directly affects the government's ability to fund resources ([[government spending]]). It causes a tax gap by the reducing tax revenue of a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America’s Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L.  |author2=Cebula, Richard  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[University of California, Los Angeles]] study showed that the economy in [[California]] was particularly weak by more than two million workers being paid without paying taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/09/28/BUG92EURPQ1.DTL&amp;type=business | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Tom | last=Abate | title=Weak outlook for state seen / Many are working under the table, UCLA group says | date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it's estimated that over US $214.6 billion went unreported to the IRS last year alone from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.finder.com/side-hustle | work=finder.com | first=Jennifer | last=McDermott | title=Side hustles and tax evasion: The telling statistics | date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those who are employed under the table, including illegal immigrants, may be denied rights that legally employed workers have, such as minimum wage, various benefits (particularly unemployment benefits), and fair treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/business/19illegals.html | work=The New York Times | first=Eduardo | last=Porter | title=Here Illegally, Working Hard and Paying Taxes | date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under-the-table employees who [[firing|lose their jobs]] may not be entitled to collect unemployment benefits. They have limited causes of action against their employers for mistreatment, on-the-job [[work accident]]s or lack of payment. Employers have limited cause of actions against employees who commit crimes such as [[embezzlement]], [[theft]], or abuse of employer.

If practices are widespread, legitimate businesses may be undercut by and have difficultly competing with those who employ staff illegally.

Government revenue agencies look for lifestyles out of line with the income reported. They have tools that aid in assessing unreported taxes, which can result in large fines or jail time for the employer.

==Advantages==
{{NPOV language|date=December 2014}}
Many new entrepreneurs fail to report their first part-time hired employees. The complexity of employment regulations and large amount of paperwork can be daunting to a new entrepreneur, especially when someone is needed for only a few hours a week. That early underground early employment may be a vital step in the growth of a healthy open economy.

[[Day laborers]] fill immediate gaps during labor shortages in some segments of the construction and landscape industries. Background checks, identification, required paperwork, and government filings for only a day's work can be prohibitive. That encourages unreported employment of short-term laborers.

A large amount of work for only a day or two is unreported. Although nanny laws make allowances for the homeowner, businesses are typically required to fill out and file several hours worth of paperwork even for an hour's worth of work.

The amounts are too small for tax collecting agencies to pursue and the paper work too arduous to file and so legitimate micro-employment among businesses is rare. However, it is an important resource for many small businesses.

In professional fields like architecture, or marketing, unreported work is typically the first step to starting a legitimate business.

Again, paperwork, compliance, and knowledge of labor laws are prohibitive for the small amount of work that is performed. Although illegal, side business generate relatively little revenue and so are rarely the target of tax enforcers. Eventually, professional employees have enough work to be able to leave their employer and become independent. Then, paperwork is usually filed and [[self-employment tax]]es are reported. The business then becomes a legitimate and beneficial part of the economy.

Those who are unlikely to find employment through the reported economy, including those with past criminal records or current warrants as well as illegal immigrants can be reasonably productive and self-sufficient. That keeps them from engaging in less-desirable activities like theft and drug use.

Self-employment in [[cottage industries]] is often unreported at first. A home cook for example, may sell a few pies to friends and co-workers without filing necessary sales taxes or self-employment taxes. Although that is usually illegal, it may lead to a legitimate and beneficial business and is often how small businesses are started.

In some countries, the tax system attempts to set minimum thresholds on the amounts liable. However, there is still the burden of compliance with the bookkeeping requirements to prove that one is exempt.

Short-term youth employment is often unreported but can be very beneficial. A teenager hired to aid in constructing a shed or barn, for example, learns valuable skills and responsibility.{{Citation needed|reason=No proof of teaching responsibility.|date=October 2013}} Most youth would not be employed for short-term projects if employment had to be reported. Government revenue collectors typically ignore enforcement of such of beneficial, unreported employment. Youth-run lemonade stands that have been shut down by police for example have received an enormous amount of bad press and public outcry.

It has been argued that because illegal immigrants are unable or unlikely to take advantage of unemployment, welfare, and retirement benefits, they are less likely to be unemployed and are more likely to contribute to a productive society. That view also argues that in states that rely primarily on [[sales tax]] as revenue instead of [[income tax]], illegal immigrants may contribute more in [[government revenues]] than the government benefits they receive thereby creating a net positive [[revenue stream]] for the governing body.

==Enforcement==
Often, both the employer and employee agree on paying in cash. Frequently, the employer is running an unreported cash-based business. These methods make detection by authorities to be time-consuming and difficult. Most small-scale operations take place without any real enforcement effort. Lawn-mowing is a good example of a cash-based business that is frequently unreported.

In the [[United States]], authorities have focused enforcement resources on large-scale operations like illegal immigrants who are employed by large companies. Discovery and enforcement of small-scaled unreported employment is typically through a secondary indiscretion like fraud, tax irregularities, and unrelated or partially-related civil/criminal violations of the employer or employee.

Although the federal government may arrest, prosecute, and imprison an individual for engaging in commerce without the state's approval, the high cost of such enforcement is usually prohibitive except for the most egregious cases.

==Examples==
===United States===
According to a ''[[The New York Times]]'' report in February 2013, the [[Obama administration]] had demonstrated a new strategy to curb the employment of illegal immigrants by focusing on companies that hire them in the first place. By concentrating on the businesses employing the large numbers of illegal workers, the number of illegal immigrants working in the US would drop dramatically. The U.S. government would be doing so in a less confrontational manner than they had in recent years.&lt;ref name="Illicit Work"&gt;{{cite web|last=Preston|first=Julia|title=US Shifts Strategy on Illicit Work by Immigrants|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03immig.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Apparel incident====
In 2009, [[American Apparel]] was convicted of having workers that partook in illicit work. About 1,800 of American Apparel's employees were illegal immigrants who were not authorized to work in the [[United States]]. No federal agents stormed into the company's factory demanding the employees to be deported, but rather sent a written notice that stated that American Apparel faced civil fines and would have to fire all workers who were unauthorized to be in the [[United States]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''voting trust''' is an arrangement whereby the [[stock|shares]] in a [[company (law)|company]] of one or more [[stockholder|shareholders]] and the voting rights attached thereto are legally transferred to a [[trustee]], usually for a specified period of time (the "trust period").  In some voting trusts, the trustee may also be granted additional powers (such as to sell or redeem the shares).  At the end of the trust period, the shares would ordinarily be re-transferred to the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary(ies)]], although in practice many voting trusts contain provisions for them to re-vested on the voting trusts with identical terms.

Voting trusts were made popular in [[Delaware]] [[corporate law]], but they have since been adopted widely by other states in the United States. They have also been extensively adopted in [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]].

== Purposes ==

There are several reasons why shareholders may wish to put a voting trust arrangement in place.
* Several shareholders may wish to create a unified block of votes, which together gives them more power than the collective sum of their fragmented interests.
* In many countries, in order to call [[general meeting]]s, shareholders need to hold a certain percentage of the issued shares of the company.  By aggregating their shares, the shareholders can confer this power on themselves collectively where they might not have it individually.
* Locking shares up in voting trusts can in some countries help deter a [[hostile takeover]].
* Voting trusts are also sometimes used to resolve [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].  By putting the shares in a trustee who can vote them at arm's-length from the beneficiary(ies) of the trust, this can in some circumstances mitigate or absolve the original shareholder from what might otherwise constitute a conflict of interest (although in practice, to resolve conflicts of interest the trust will ordinarily be "[[blind trust]]"; while all blind trusts are necessarily voting trusts, not all voting trusts are blind trusts).
* Shares are sometimes aggregated into a voting trust to facilitate a corporate reorganisation.
* Promoters of companies sometimes aggregate their shares in a voting trust to safeguard control of the company.

A '''waybill''' ([[International Union of Railways|UIC]]) is a document issued by a [[common carrier|carrier]] giving details and instructions relating to the [[shipment]] of a [[consignment]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Typically it will show the names of the [[consignor]] and [[consignee]], the point of origin of the consignment, its destination, and [[Thoroughfare|route]]. Most freight forwarders and trucking companies use an in-house waybill called a house bill. These typically contain "conditions of contract of carriage" terms on the back of the form. These terms cover limits to liability and other terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/waybill.html|title=What is a waybill? definition and meaning|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A waybill is similar to that of a courier's receipt which contains the details of the consignor and the consignee, and also the point of origin and destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.jctrans.net/jcnet/il/express/2007111542615.shtml|title=What are Courier's Receipt|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=JCtrans Technology Co., Ltd.|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air waybills==
Most airlines use a different form called an [[air waybill]] which lists additional items such as airport of destination, flight number, and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/air-waybill-AWB.html|title=What is air waybill(AWB)? definition and meaning|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sea waybills==
The UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(1) applies to: 
*[[bill of lading|bills of lading]] s.1(2), 
* sea waybills s.1(3), and 
* ships' delivery orders s.1(4), 
... whether in paper or electronic form s.1(5). 

Under s.1(3) of the Act, a sea waybill is: "any document which is not a bill of lading but is such a receipt for goods as contains a contract for the carriage of goods by sea; and identifies the person to whom delivery of the goods is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract".

s.2 continues: "...a person who becomes the person who (without being an original party to the contract of carriage) is the person to whom delivery of the goods to which a sea waybill relates is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract ... shall (by virtue of becoming the person to whom delivery is to be made) have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract of carriage".

Note: the UK's [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] does NOT apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea.

'''William "Bill" Bernbach''' (August 13, 1911 – October 2, 1982) was an American advertising creative director. He was one of the three founders in 1949 of the international [[advertising agency]] [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] (DDB). He directed many of the firm's breakthrough ad campaigns and had a lasting impact on the creative team structures now commonly used by ad agencies.

==Early life==
Bill Bernbach was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Advertising"] retrieved June 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] to Rebecca and Jacob Bernbach. He attended New York City public schools and in 1932 earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A]] degree from [[New York University]]. He had majored in English but also studied business administration, philosophy and music, playing the piano .&lt;ref name="Levenson pXV"&gt;Levenson pXV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1933, Bernbach took a job running the Schenley Distillers mailroom. This was during [[the Depression]] and a family connection got him the job.&lt;ref name="Ad Age - Fred Danzig remembers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=146536|title=What You Missed Last Night on 'Mad Men'|author=Matthew Creamer|publisher=Advertising Age|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pro-actively wrote an ad for Schenley's American Cream Whiskey, which he got into the right hands and the ad ran. He was promoted to the advertising department.&lt;ref name="Levenson pXV"/&gt;

He left Schenley in 1939 to ghostwrite for [[Grover Whalen]], the head of the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 World's Fair]] and the following year he entered the advertising industry at the William Weintraub agency. He saw two years' active service in [[World War II]] and thereafter had a role at Coty, followed by a position at [[Grey Advertising]]. He commenced there as a [[Copywriter]] but was promoted to [[Creative Director]] by 1947.

However, soon Bernbach became frustrated with the sameness he saw in all advertising. In a plea to agency management he penned a letter expressing that concern. One paragraph in particular revealed Bernbach's desire to change advertising creativity:

{{blockquote|"There are a lot of great technicians in advertising. And unfortunately they talk the best game. They know all the rules. They can tell you that people in an ad will get you greater readership. They can tell you that a sentence should be this short or that long. They can tell you that body copy should be broken up for easier reading. They can give you fact after fact after fact. They are the scientists of advertising. But there's one little rub. Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2008/02/advertisings-le.html#.VKdKsIrF_vQ&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1949, with [[James Edwin Doyle]], whom he had met at Grey, and [[Maxwell Dane]], who was already running a tiny agency, Bernbach founded their eponymous ad agency in [[Manhattan]]. His philosophy towards creative advertising was that the creative execution (the way the message is conveyed) is just as important as the message content (what is being said). &lt;ref&gt;Kazmi, D.H.H. and Batra, S.K., ''Advertising and Sales Promotion'', Excel Books, 2009, pp 381-382&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding Bernbach played an integral role in the writing of advertising, distancing himself from the administrative and promotional aspects of the business which were left to Dane. He served as the creative engine behind the agency helping billings to increase from approximately US$1 million to more than US$40 million by the time he retired.

DDB grew to become the 11th largest advertising agency in America by 1976, when Bernbach stepped aside as [[Chief Executive Officer]]&lt;ref name="Advertising Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=540|title=Bill Bernbach at the Advertising Hall of Fame|author=American Advertising Federation|publisher=American Advertising Federation|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become chairman of the executive committee.

His most notable campaign was for Volkswagen, which included ads such as ''[[Think Small]]'' and ''Lemon''. Other notable campaigns created by Bernbach's team are:
* ''We Try Harder'' for [[Avis Rent a Car System]]
* ''Mikey'' for [[Life (cereal)|Life Cereal]]
* ''You Don't Have to be Jewish to Love Levy's'' for [[Levy's (bakery)|Levy's]] Rye Bread
* ''It's so simple'' for [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]].

Bernbach's campaign for Avis Rent-a-Car effectively pioneered "underdog advertising" and was an instant hit with the market. It debuted in 1962, when Avis was losing market share to close rival, Hertz and helped the company's financial position turn  around from a loss to a profit in a single year. The campaign tagline remained unchanged for 50 years, and is one of advertising's most enduring campaigns. &lt;ref&gt;Richards, K., "How Avis Brilliantly Pioneered Underdog Advertising With ‘We Try Harder’" ''Adweek, 24 July, 2017 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Bernbach was noted for his devotion to creativity and offbeat themes, a legacy that has credited him as a major force behind the ''Creative Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s''. His work often was characterized by simplicity. He also is credited with being the first to combine [[copywriter]]s and [[art director]]s into two-person teams. They commonly had been in separate departments, a model that still exists in [[advertising agencies]] today.

Bernbach won many awards and honors for his work within the advertising industry during his career. He was inducted into the Copywriters Hall of Fame in 1964, received the Man of the Year of Advertising Award in 1964 and 1965, and The Pulse Inc., Man of the Year Award in 1966. He was also named "Top Advertising Agency Executive" in 1969 and received the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] Award in 1976 and was inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame in the same year. He designed the Advertising Hall of Fame "Golden Ladder" trophy.&lt;ref name="Advertising Hall of Fame"/&gt;

The [[AMC (TV network)|AMC]] program, ''[[Mad Men]]'', which centers on the fictional ad agency of ''Sterling Cooper'' in the early 1960s, makes many references to Bernbach; Bernbach's innovative techniques challenge Sterling Cooper's more orthodox style, and DDB often is mentioned as a competitor in the second season.

==Personal life==
At the Schenley Distillers mailroom in the 1930s, one of Bernbach's assistants was Evelyn Carbone, a college student at [[Hunter College]], who addressed labels on outgoing mail.

While Bernbach worked his way into the advertising department, Evelyn became a receptionist. They fell in love and were married in 1938 by a [[justice of the peace]]. Bernbach's family was against the marriage on religious grounds, but they lived happily and had two sons: John L.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0919/077.html Forbes: "Matchmakers - Two venerable admen aim to introduce big brands to newfangled marketing in blogs, hospitals and hotels–for a price" by Melanie Wells] September 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/nyregion/paul-bernbach-57-investor-and-art-patron.html New York Times: "Paul Bernbach, 57, Investor and Art Patron" by Eric Pace] June 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bill's death, Evelyn and [[Bob Levenson]], the DDB creative leader, published "Bill Bernbach's Book: A History of Advertising that Changed the History of Advertising".&lt;ref name="Ad Age - Fred Danzig remembers"/&gt;
