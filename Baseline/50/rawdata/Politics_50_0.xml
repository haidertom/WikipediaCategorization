      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2123">[[File:Mobutu1.jpg|thumb|Mobutu wearing a long sleeved abacost (at left) in 1983.]]
The '''abacost''', abbreviation for the French ''"à bas le costume"'' (literally "down with the suit"), was the distinctive clothing for men that was promoted by [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] as part of his ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticité]]'' programme in [[Zaire]], between 1972 and 1990. Zairians were banned from wearing Western-style [[suit (clothing)|suits]] with [[shirt]] and [[necktie|tie]] to symbolise the break with their colonial past. The abacost was a lightweight suit, worn without a tie, though sometimes with a [[cravat]]. It closely resembled a [[Mao suit]]. It was seen in long-sleeved and short-sleeved versions.

The abacost was seen as the uniform of Mobutu's supporters, especially those who had benefited from his regime. When Mobutu announced a transition to multiparty democracy in 1990, he said that the Western suit and tie would be allowed, but that he continued to favor the abacost and it would still be considered the national dress. Subsequently, when the transitional government was sworn in, all of the ministers were wearing abacosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0148) ''Zaire: A Country Study'' POLITICAL REFORM IN THE 1990s - Proclamation of the Third Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arzoni]] in [[Asse|Zellik, Belgium]] produced the world's "chicest" abacosts.&lt;ref name=dvr&gt;{{cite book| author=[[David van Reybrouck]]| title=[[Congo: The Epic History of a People]]| publisher=[[HarperCollins]], 2012 |page=381f |isbn=978-0-06-220011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfons Mertens, employed by Arzoni, became Mobutu's personal tailor, also making uniforms for him and his entourage.&lt;ref name=dvr/&gt;

The abacost fell out of favour after Mobutu's fall from power.

[[File:Statue of Liberty 7.jpg|thumb|German professor Sieglinde Lemke argues that the [[Statue of Liberty]] "signifies this proselytizing mission as the natural extension of the US' sense of itself as an exceptional nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Winfried Fluck|author2=Donald E. Pease|author3=John Carlos Rowe|title=Re-framing the Transnational Turn in American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMEHiv4LnasC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2011|publisher=University Press of New England|page=207|isbn=9781611681901}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''American exceptionalism''' is an ideology holding the [[United States]] as unique among nations in positive or negative connotations, with respect to its ideas of democracy and personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=What, exactly, is 'American exceptionalism'? | author=Tyrrell, Ian | date=October 21, 2016 | magazine=The Week | url=http://theweek.com/articles/654508/what-exactly-american-exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the concept has no formal definition, there are some themes common to various conceptions of the idea. One is the history of the United States is different from other nations.&lt;ref name="amerExcep"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=812lbix0oH4C&amp;pg=PA18 ''American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword.''] Seymour Martin Lipset. New York, N.Y.: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc. 1996. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, American [[exceptionalism]] stems from the [[American Revolution]], becoming what political scientist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] called "the first new nation"&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''The first new nation'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the American ideology of "[[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]]", based on [[liberty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[individualism]], [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], [[democracy]], and [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]]. This [[ideology]] itself is often referred to as "American exceptionalism."&lt;ref name=Lipset1997&gt;Lipset, ''American Exceptionalism'', pp. 1, 17–19, 165–74, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme is the idea that the U.S. has a unique mission to transform the world. Abraham Lincoln stated in the [[Gettysburg address]] (1863), Americans have a duty to ensure "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Another theme is the sense the United States' history and mission give it a superiority over other nations.

The theory of the [[exceptionalism]] of the U.S. has developed over time and can be traced to many sources. French political scientist and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was the first writer to describe the country as "exceptional" in 1831 and 1840.&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville, Alexis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEQvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 ''Democracy in America''] (1840), part 2, p. 36: "The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no other democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."&lt;/ref&gt; The actual phrase "American Exceptionalism" was originally coined by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] as a critique of a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] faction of American Communists who argued that the American political climate was unique, making it an 'exception' to certain elements of [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] is often credited with having crystallized this ideology in recent decades.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Political scientist Eldon Eisenach argues in the twenty-first century American exceptionalism has come under attack from the postmodern left as a reactionary myth: "The absence of a shared purposes ratified in the larger sphere of liberal-progressive public policy....beginning with the assumption of American exceptionalism as a reactionary myth."&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Eisenach, "A Progressive Conundrum: Federal Constitution, National State, and Popular Sovereignty" in Stephen Skowronek et al., eds., ''The Progressives' Century: Political Reform, Constitutional Government, and the Modern American State'' (Yale UP. 2016) pp 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

The exact term "American exceptionalism" was occasionally used in the 19th century. In his ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', Fred Shapiro notes "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image by [[The Times]] of London on August 20, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/27/american_exceptionalism_neither_joseph_stalin_nor_alexis_de_tocqueville.html Zimmer, Ben "Did Stalin Really Coin "American Exceptionalism"?", Slate.com] Retrieved 1st of February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Its common use dates from Communist usage in the late 1920s. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] chastised members of the [[Jay Lovestone]]-led faction of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] for its claim the U.S. was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions". Stalin may have been told of the usage "American exceptionalism" by Broder &amp; Zack in ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. American Communists started using the English term "American exceptionalism" in factional fights. It then moved into general use among intellectuals.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Albert Fried, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLJbT3NMbN4C&amp;pg=PA7 ''Communism in America: A History in Documents''] (1997), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald E. Pease|title=The New American Exceptionalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2009|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|page=10|isbn=978-0-8166-2782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted most American historians endorse exceptionalism. He suggests these historians reason as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;America marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Richard | year = 1989 | title = How Exceptional is the American Political Economy? | jstor = 2150989 | journal = Political Science Quarterly | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.2307/2150989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[postnationalism|postnationalist]] scholars have rejected American exceptionalism, arguing the U.S. did not break from European history, and accordingly, the U.S. has retained class-based and [[racial inequality in the United States|race-based differences]], as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Noble, ''Death of a Nation: American Culture and the end of exceptionalism'', pp. xxiii ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask:
:Why has the myth of American exceptionalism, characterized by a belief in America's highly distinctive features or unusual trajectory based on the abundance of its natural resources, its revolutionary origins and its Protestant religious culture that anticipated God's blessing of the nation, held such tremendous staying power, from its influence in popular culture to its critical role in foreign policy?&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Roberts and Lindsay DiCuirci, eds., ''American Exceptionalism''  (2013) vol. 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology, thereby avoid entangling themselves in rhetorical debates. [[Bernard Bailyn]], a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, is a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, uses the phrase "American exceptionalism," he insists upon the "distinctive characteristics of British North American life." He has argued the process of social and cultural transmission result in peculiarly American patterns of education (in the broadest sense of the word); and he believes in the unique character of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen and Stanley N. Katz. "Bernard Bailyn, Historian, and Teacher: An Appreciation." in James A. Henretta, Michael Kämmen, and Stanley N. Katz, eds. ''The Transformation of Early American History: Society, Authority, and Ideology'' (1991) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
Although the concept of American exceptionalism dates to the founding ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution''. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; the term was first used in the 1920s.

Some claim the phrase "American exceptionalism" originated with the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] in an English translation of a condemnation made in 1929 by Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] criticizing Communist supporters of [[Jay Lovestone]] for the heretical belief the US was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions".&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=American+exceptionalism+stalin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=piVIT6arD8Xt0gGMsIXuDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20exceptionalism%20stalin&amp;f=false The New American Exceptionalism], [[Donald E. Pease]]  U of Minnesota Press, 2009 {{ISBN|0-8166-2783-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-2783-7}} Length 246 pages p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This origin has been challenged, however, because the expression "American exceptionalism" was already used by Brouder &amp; Zack in the ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. Also, Fred Shapiro, editor of ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', has noted "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image during the Civil War by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on August 20, 1861.

Early examples of the term's usage do include a declaration made at the 1930 American Communist convention proclaiming "the storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism".&lt;ref name="atl1"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-joseph-stalin-invented-american-exceptionalism/254534/ How Joseph Stalin Invented American Exceptionalism], ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase fell to obscurity after the 1930s, and in the 1980s American newspapers popularized it to describe America's cultural and political uniqueness.&lt;ref name="atl1" /&gt; The phrase became an issue of contention between presidential candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], with Republicans attacking Obama for not believing in the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iviea | first1 = Robert L. | last2 = Ginerb | first2 = Oscar | year = 2009 | title = American Exceptionalism in a Democratic Idiom: Transacting the Mythos of Change in the 2008 Presidential Campaign | url = | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 359–75 | doi = 10.1080/10510970903109961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==

=== Alexis de Tocqueville and others, from 1835 ===
The first reference to the concept by name, and possibly its origin, was by French writer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835/1840 work, ''[[Democracy in America]]'':&lt;ref&gt;"Foreword: on American Exceptionalism; Symposium on Treaties, Enforcement, and U.S. Sovereignty", ''Stanford Law Review'', May 1, 2003, p. 1479&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their strictly Puritanical origin, their exclusively commercial habits, even the country they inhabit, which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science, literature, and the arts, the proximity of Europe, which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism, a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to point out the most important, have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects. His passions, his wants, his education, and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward; his religion alone bids him turn, from time to time, a transient and distracted glance to heaven. Let us cease, then, to view all democratic nations under the example of the American people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexis de Tocqueville]], ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Vintage Books, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kammen says many foreign visitors commented on American exceptionalism including [[Karl Marx]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Hermann Eduard von Holst]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Hilaire Belloc]]; they did so in complimentary terms.&lt;ref&gt;Kammen p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme became common, especially in textbooks. From the 1840s to the late 19th century, the [[McGuffey Readers]] sold 120 million copies and were studied by most American students. Skrabec (2009) argues the ''Readers'' "hailed American exceptionalism, [[manifest destiny]], and America as God's country... Furthermore, McGuffey saw America as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quentin R.

=== Communist debate, 1927 ===
In June 1927 [[Jay Lovestone]], a leader of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party in America]] and soon to be named General Secretary, described America's economic and social uniqueness. He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism, and the country's "tremendous reserve power"; strength and power which he said prevented [[Communist revolution]].&lt;ref name=Fried1997&gt;Fried, Albert.

=== Uniqueness===
In general, Americans have had consideration in national "uniqueness." Historian Dorothy Ross points to three different currents regarding unique characteristics. 
# Some Protestants believed American progress would facilitate the return of Jesus Christ and [[Millennialism|Christian Millennium]].&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science'' |year =1991|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some 19th century historians linked American liberty to the development of liberty in Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science'' |year =1991|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Other American writers looked to the "millennial newness" of America. [[Henry Nash Smith]] stressed the theme of "virgin land" in the [[American frontier]] that promised an escape from the decay that befell earlier republics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Nash Smith, "The Frontier Hypothesis and the Myth of the West." ''American Quarterly'' 2.1 (1950): 3–11. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2710571 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science'' |year =1991|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st-century development ===
Recently, socialists and other writers tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the U.S. within and outside its borders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm American Exceptionalism]. The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept has also been discussed in the context of the 21st century in a book co-authored by [[Dick Cheney|former American Vice President Dick Cheney]]: ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name="simonandschuster"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America|author=Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= 2015 |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date= November 3, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes in their historical context ==
Scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism.

=== Absence of feudalism ===
Many scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist [[Louis Hartz]]. In ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955), Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacks the left-wing/socialist  and right-wing/aristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial America lacked any feudal traditions, such as established churches, landed estates and a hereditary nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine A. |last=Holland |title=Hartz and Minds: The Liberal Tradition after the Cold War |journal=Studies in American Political Development |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=227–33 |doi=10.1017/S0898588X05000155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "liberal consensus" school, typified by [[David M. Potter|David Potter]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Richard Hofstadter]] followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding [[private property]], [[individual right]]s, and [[representative government]]. The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Cross |title=Comparative Exceptionalism: Rethinking the Hartz Thesis in the Settler Societies of Nineteenth-Century United States and Australia |journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies |year=1995 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–41 |jstor=41053761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puritan roots and Protestant promise===
Parts of American exceptionalism can be traced to [[Puritan|American Puritan]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Gandziarowski, ''The Puritan Legacy to American Politics'' (2010) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Many Puritans with [[Arminian]] leanings embraced a middle ground between strict [[Predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist predestination]] and a less restricting theology of [[Divine Providence]]. They believed God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the Earth. One Puritan leader, [[John Winthrop]], metaphorically expressed this idea as a "[[City upon a Hill]]"—that the Puritan community of New England should serve as a model community for the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Justin B. Litke, "Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist," ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html |title=John Winthrop, A Modell of Christian Charity(1630)|editor=The Hanover Historical Texts Project |publisher=Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society (Boston, 1838), 3rd series 7:31–48. |date=August 1996 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413143419/http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html| archivedate= April 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism. The Puritans' moralistic values {{clarify|date=June 2018}} remained part of the national identity of the United States for centuries, remaining influential to the present day.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In this vein, Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. Eric Luis Uhlmann of Northwestern University argues that Puritan values were taken up by all remaining Americans as time went by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/AME%20CHAPTER.POSTING.pdf |title=Chapter posting |website=www.socialjudgments.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin M. Schultz underlines how they helped America to keep to its ''Protestant Promise'', especially [[Catholics]] and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MPIVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=protestant+promise#v=onepage&amp;q=protestant+promise&amp;f=false|title=Tri-Faith America: How Catholics and Jews Held Postwar America to Its Protestant Promise|first=Kevin M.|last=Schultz|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199987542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Revolution and republicanism ===
The ideas that created the American Revolution were derived from a tradition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that had been repudiated by the British mainstream. Historian [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] has argued, "Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Wood, "Introduction" in ''Idea of America: Reflections on the Birth of the United States'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Idea-America-Reflections-United-States/dp/1594202907#reader_B004IYIUFG online].&lt;/ref&gt; Wood notes that the term is "presently much-maligned," although it is vigorously supported by others such as Jon Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon S. Wood|title=The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnSvZs1Q7_oC&amp;pg=PT240|year= 2009|publisher=Penguin|page=240|isbn=9781440637919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land, a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country. These sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the Revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to [[republicanism]], the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ari |last=Hoogenboom |authorlink=Ari Hoogenboom |chapter=American Exceptionalism Republicanism as Ideology |editor-first=Elisabeth |editor-last=Gläser |editor2-first=Hermann |editor2-last=Wellenreuther |title=Bridging the Atlantic: the question of American exceptionalism in perspective |year=2002 |pages=43–67 |isbn=978-0-521-78205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom characterized the [[American Revolution]] in unique ways—at a time when major nations had state religions. Republicanism (led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]) created modern [[constitutional republicanism]], with a limit on ecclesiastical powers. Historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues, "With the onset of the revolutionary crisis, a significant conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up America for some particular purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kidd |title=God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2010 |page=9 |isbn=978-0-465-00235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd further argues that "a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, ''God of Liberty,'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty ===
According to Tucker and Hendrickson (1992), Jefferson believed America "was the bearer of a new diplomacy, founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people, that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man, by means that escaped war and its corruptions". Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on "reason of state" (which could justify any action) and the usual priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson, ''Empire of liberty: the statecraft of Thomas Jefferson'' (1992) quote on p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson envisaged America is becoming the world's great "[[Empire of Liberty]]"—that is, the model for democracy and republicanism. He identified his nation as a beacon to the world, for, he said on departing the presidency in 1809, America was: "Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government, from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth, if other areas of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tucker and  Hendrickson, ''Empire of Liberty'' p. 7; see John P. Foley, ed. ''The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia'' (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA895&amp;dq=%22Trusted+with+the+destinies+of+this+solitary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T4A-Ttm4IMPTiAK-37zDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Trusted%20with%20the%20destinies%20of%20this%20solitary%22&amp;f=false text p. 895]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of arguments ==

[[Marilyn B. Young]] argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991, neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an "American empire," a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations, particularly poor ones. She argues that after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America, an attitude that harmonized with this new vision of American empire. Young says the Iraq War (2003–2011) exemplified American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn B. Young, "One Empire Under G", ''European Contributions to American Studies'', May 2004, Vol. 55, pp. 8–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, conservative historians [[Larry Schweikart]] and Dave Dougherty argued that American Exceptionalism be based on four pillars: (1) [[Common Law]]; (2) Virtue and morality located in Protestant Christianity; (3) Free-market capitalism; and (4) the sanctity of private property.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Schweikart and Dave Dougherty, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, From America's Exceptional Ascent to the Atomic Bomb, 1898–1945''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-089-8}}. Moreover, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, Vol. II, From the Cold War to the Age of Entitlement, 1945–2012''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-104-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 book entitled ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', former U.S. [[Vice President Dick Cheney]] sets out and argues the case for American Exceptionalism, and concludes: "we are, as [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] said, 'the last, best hope of earth.' We are not just one more nation, one more same entity on the world stage. We have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom, and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us, as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] did, of the unique role we play. Neither they nor we should ever forget that we are, in fact, exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Dick and Liz Cheney. ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', Threshold Editions, New York, 2015. pp. 259ff. {{ISBN|978-1-5011-1541-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican ethos and ideas about nationhood ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States be exceptional in that it was founded on a set of [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in his [[Gettysburg Address]], America is a nation "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". In Lincoln's interpretation, America is inextricably connected with freedom and equality, and in world perspective, the American mission is to ensure, "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."  Historian [[T. Harry Williams]] argues that Lincoln believed:
: In the United States man would create a society that would be the best and the happiest in the world. The United States was the supreme demonstration of democracy. However, the Union did not exist just to make men free in America. It had an even greater mission—to make them free everywhere. By the mere force of its example, America would bring democracy to an undemocratic world.&lt;ref&gt;T. Harry Williams, "Abraham Lincoln – Principle and Pragmatism in Politics: A Review Article," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1953) 40#1 pp. 89–106 at page 97 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1897545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism (between the states and the federal government) and [[checks and balances]] (among the legislative, executive and judicial branches), which were designed to prevent any faction, region, or government organ from becoming too powerful. Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that this system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a "[[tyranny of the majority]]", are preservative of a free republican democracy, and also that it allows citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those voters' values. A consequence of this political system is that laws can vary widely across the country. Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that this system merely replaces the power of the national majority over states with power by the states over local entities. On balance, the American political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more domestic dominance than does a more [[unitary state|unitary]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Alan Dahl|title=Toward democracy--a journey: reflections, 1940–1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FacUAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies Press, University of California, Berkeley|page=2:711|isbn=9780877723721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Eric Foner]] has explored the question of birthright citizenship, the provision of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) that makes every baby born in the United States a full citizen.
He argues that:
: birthright citizenship stands as an example of the much-abused idea of American exceptionalism... birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. No European nation recognizes the principle.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner,
[http://www.thenation.com/article/birthright-citizenship-is-the-good-kind-of-american-exceptionalism/ "Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism," ''The Nation'' Aug. 27, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global leadership and activism ===
Yale Law School Dean [[Harold Hongju Koh]] has identified what he says is "the most important respect in which the United States has been genuinely exceptional, about international affairs, international law, and promotion of human rights: namely, in its outstanding global leadership and activism." He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To this day, the United States remains the only superpower capable, and at times willing, to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build, sustain, and drive an international system committed to international law, democracy, and the promotion of human rights. Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights, from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hongju Koh, "On American Exceptionalism" 55 Stan. L. Rev. 1479 (2003) quote at p. 1487 [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2737&amp;context=fss_papers online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peggy Noonan]], an American political pundit, wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that "America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it tries to be a force for good because it is exceptional".

Former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] explores the concept of United States global leadership in a 2015 book on American foreign policy entitled ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'', co-authored with his daughter, [[Liz Cheney]], a former official of the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, By Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= September 2015|website= Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date= October 5, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frontier spirit ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that many features of the "American spirit"  were shaped by the frontier process (following [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]). They argue the American frontier allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and equality and shed centuries-old European institutions such as royalty, standing armies, established churches and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Etulain, ''Does the Frontier Experience Make America Exceptional?'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this frontier experience was not entirely unique to the United States. Other nations had frontiers, but it did not shape them nearly as much as the American frontier did, usually because it was under the control of a strong national government. South Africa, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia had long frontiers, but they did not have "free land" and local control.&lt;ref&gt;Walker D. Wyman and Clifton B. Kroeber, eds. ''Frontier in Perspective'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; The political and cultural environments were much different—the other frontiers did not involve widespread ownership of free land nor allow the settlers to control the local and provincial governments as in America. Their edge did not shape their national psyches.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin K. Mikesell, "Comparative Studies in Frontier History," in Richard Hofstadter and Seymour Martin Lipset, eds., ''Turner and the Sociology of the Frontier'' (1968) pp. 152–72&lt;/ref&gt; Each nation had entirely different frontier experiences. For example, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Boers]] in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, "mateship" and working together was valued more than individualism was in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mateship and Individualism in Modern Australian Drama |first=Dennis |last=Carroll |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=34 |issue=4 |year=1982 |pages=467–80 |jstor=3206809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobility and welfare ===
{{further|Economic mobility|Social mobility}}
For most of its history, especially from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, the United States has been known as the "land of opportunity", and in this sense, it prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hartmut |last=Kaelble |title=Social Mobility in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Europe and America in Comparative Perspective |year=1981 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-05274-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this [[social mobility]] include:
* Occupational—children could easily choose careers which were not based upon their parents' choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephan |last=Thernstrom |title=The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880–1970 |year=1999 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-1-58348-443-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical—that geographical location was not seen as static, and citizens often relocated freely over long distances without barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Stephenson |first2=Richard |last2=Jensen |first3=Janice Reiff |last3=Webster |title=Social predictors of American mobility: a census capture-recapture study of New York and Wisconsin, 1875–1905 |publisher=Newberry Library |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Status—as in most countries, family standing and riches were often a means to remain in a higher social circle. America was notably unusual due to an accepted wisdom that anyone—from poor immigrants upwards—who worked hard, could aspire to similar standing, regardless of circumstances of birth. This aspiration is commonly called living the [[American dream]]. Birth details were not taken as a social barrier to the upper echelons or high political status in American culture. This stood in contrast to other countries where many larger offices were socially determined, and usually hard to enter without being born into the suitable social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter M. |last=Blau |first2=Otis Dudley |last2=Duncan |title=The American Occupational Structure |location=London |publisher=Collier Macmillan |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-02-903670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, social mobility in the U.S. is lower than in some [[European Union]] countries if defined regarding income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there compared to similar people in the [[Nordic countries]] or the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/338|title=Structural rigidities in the US and Europe|last=De Grauwe|first=Paul|date=July 2, 2007|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many economists, such as Harvard economist [[N. Gregory Mankiw]], however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it is a reflection of income disparity: "Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html|date=January 12, 2011|title=Half-Full Glass of Economic Mobility|format=blog|first=Greg|last=Mankiw|accessdate=January 1, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122182147/http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html| archivedate= January 22, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding public welfare, [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] asked in 1989 whether the evidence shows whether the U.S. "is becoming more like other mixed-economy welfare states, or increasingly exceptional." He concludes, "By comparison with other advanced industrial nations America is today exceptional in total public expenditure, in major program priorities, and in the value of public benefits."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "How Exceptional is the American Political Economy?" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1989) 104#1 pp. 91, 92 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2150989 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Scholars have been polarized on the topic, according to [[Michael Kammen]] with historians generally against it, while empirical social scientists have tended to be supporters.   Kammen reports that historians Lawrence Veysey, [[C. Vann Woodward]], [[Eric Foner]], [[Sean Wilentz]], [[Akira Iriye]],  and Ian Tyrrell have been opponents, while support has come from social scientists [[Daniel Bell]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], Alex Inkeles, Sanford Jacoby, [[Samuel P. Huntington]], Mona Harrington, John P. Roche, Richard Rose, [[Peter Temin]], and [[Aaron Wildavsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" ''American Quarterly'' (1993) p. 2 [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR2/kammen.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kammen argues that the hostile attacks began in the 1970s in the wake of the Vietnam War, when many intellectuals decided, "The American Adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless, tarnished Gulliver."&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the [[social history|new social history]] used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with Europe on issues such as social mobility. By the 1980s, labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a work party to emerge in the United States did not mean that America was exceptionally favorable grounds for workers. By the late 1980s, other academic critics started mocking the extreme chauvinism displayed by the modern usage of exceptionalism. Finally mid-1980s, colonial historians downplayed the uniqueness of the American experience in the context of British history.&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some of the critics pulled their punches, with Wilentz arguing for "distinctively American forms of class conflict" and Foner saying there was a  "distinctive character of American trade unionism."&lt;ref&gt;Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The third idea of American exceptionalism—superiority—has been attacked with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards. In ''American Exceptionalism and Human Rights'' (2005), Canadian commentator [[Michael Ignatieff]] couches his discussion of the topic in entirely pejorative terms. He identifies three main sub-types: "exemptionalism" (supporting treaties as long as U.S. citizens are exempt from them); "double standards" (criticizing "others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodies, but ignoring what these organizations say of the United States"); and "legal isolationism" (the tendency of U.S. judges to ignore other jurisdictions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Ignatieff|title=American Exceptionalism and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUiZLQdGJwkC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2009|pages=3–8|isbn=978-1400826889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exceptionalism as "exemptionalism" ===
During the [[George W. Bush administration]] (2001–2009), the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hegemony or Empire?: The Redefinition of US Power Under George W. Bush |author=Charles Philippe David, David Grondin|isbn = 978-0754647744|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being "above" or an "exception" to the law, specifically the [[public international law|Law of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/ |title=Could Bush Be Prosecuted for War Crimes? |journal=Alternet |last=Frel |first=Jan |date=July 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 17, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513225220/http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/| archivedate= May 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law.) This new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis, and actual orientation diverges somewhat from prior uses of the phrase. A certain number of those who subscribe to "old-style" or "traditional American exceptionalism"-the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others, that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a unique role to play in world history—also agree that the United States is and ought to be entirely subject to and bound by the [[public international law]]. Indeed, recent research shows that "there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thimm|first=Johannes|title=American Exceptionalism – Conceptual Thoughts and Empirical Evidence|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 25, 2009|accessdate=29 October 2013|location=Berlin|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2013, in the context of U.S. President Barack Obama's comment about American exceptionalism during his September 10, 2013, talk to the American people while considering military action on [[Syria]] for its alleged use of [[chemical weapons]] against civilians, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] criticized Obama saying that "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?_r=0 ''Vladimir Putin's comments on American exceptionalism, Syria cause a fuss.''] CNN. 12 September 2013. Retrieved 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT]] on October 4, 2013, President of Ecuador [[Rafael Correa]] criticized Obama's policies and compared America's exceptionalism with [[Nazi Germany]], saying: "Does not this remind you of the Nazis' rhetoric before and during World War II? They considered themselves the chosen race, the superior race, etc. Such words and ideas pose extreme danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ecuador's Correa: Obama's exceptionalism talk reminiscent of Nazi rhetoric before WWII|url=http://rt.com/news/correa-us-exceptionalism-dangerous-748/|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=RT|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral purity ===
Critics on the left such as Marilyn Young and [[Howard Zinn]] have argued that American history is so morally flawed, citing [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] and [[social welfare]] issues, that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Zinn |title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present |year=1980 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=|title-link=A People's History of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn argues that American exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign, especially when dealing with Native Americans.&lt;ref name="The Myth of American Exceptionalism"&gt;{{cite web | author = Howard Zinn |url=http://video.mit.edu/watch/the-myth-of-american-exceptionalism-9935/|title = The Myth of American Exceptionalism |accessdate=October 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016192523/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/258/| archivedate= October 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald E. Pease]] mocks American exceptionalism as a "state fantasy" and a "myth" in his 2009 book ''The New American Exceptionalism''.&lt;ref name="Pease"&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Pease |title=The New American Exceptionalism |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2009 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pease notes that "state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask", showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] and the exposure of government incompetence after [[Hurricane Katrina]] "opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism".&lt;ref name="Pease" /&gt;

American theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] argued that the automatic assumption that America acts for the right will bring about moral corruption. However, Niebuhr did support the nation's Cold War policies. His position (called "[[Christian realism]]") advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |first=Mark |last=Edwards |title='God Has Chosen Us': Re-Membering Christian Realism, Rescuing Christendom, and the Contest of Responsibilities during the Cold War |journal=Diplomatic History |year=2009 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=67–94 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2008.00747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double standards ===
U.S. historians like Thomas Bender "try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism, a defect he esteems to be inherited from the [[Cold War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/wp/?p=307 |title=Index of /wp |publisher=Gilderlehrman.org |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary W. Reichard and Ted Dickson argue "how the development of the United States has always [[dependency theory|depended]] on its transactions with other nations for [[commodities]], cultural values and populations".&lt;ref&gt;Reichard, Gary W.; Ted Dickson.

=== The Americanist heresy ===
{{Main|Americanism (heresy)}}

In 1898 [[Pope Leo XIII]] denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of [[Americanism (heresy)|Americanism]] in the encyclical ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7630&amp;CFID=11811177&amp;CFTOKEN=51286733 |title=Americanism, Then and Now: Our Pet Heresy |publisher=Catholic Culture |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He targeted  American exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain, arguing that it stood in  opposition to Papal denunciations of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p22.htm |title=The Heresy of Americanism: Response to Radical Traditionalists |publisher=Bringyou.to |accessdate=March 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100205103443/http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p22.htm| archivedate= February 5, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://are.as.wvu.edu/massey.htm |title=The Phantom Heresy? |publisher=West Virginia University |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century, there was a tendency among Catholic clergy in the United States to view American society as inherently different from other Christian nations, and to argue that the understanding of Church doctrine had to be enlarged in order to encompass  the 'American Experience', which included greater individualism, tolerance of other religions, and Church–State separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAvoy | first1 = Thomas T. | year = 1959 | title = The Catholic Minority after the Americanist Controversy, 1899–1917 | url = | journal = Review of Politics | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 53–82 | doi=10.1017/s0034670500021975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-emptive declinism ===
[[Herbert London]] has defined ''pre-emptive [[declinism]]'' as a postmodern belief "that the United States is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=6372 |title=Is the U.S. Still a Dependable Ally? |publisher=Hudson Institute |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; London ascribed the view to [[Paul Krugman]], among others.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=35976 |title=Examining Declinism |publisher=HumanEvents.com |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman had written in ''The New York Times'' that "We have always known that America's reign as the world's greatest nation would eventually end. However, most of us imagined that our downfall, when it came, would be something grand and tragic."&lt;ref name=Krugman /&gt;

According to [[RealClearPolitics]], declarations of America's declining power have been common in the English-language media. In 1988, [[Flora Lewis]] said that "Talk of U.S. decline is real in the sense that the U.S. can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills." According to [[Anthony Lewis]] in 1990, Europeans and Asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the United States is in decline. Citing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy and "crucial weaknesses" in the military, [[Tom Wicker]] concluded "that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficult—nearly impossible—for the United States".&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics.com" /&gt; In 2004, [[Pat Buchanan]] lamented "the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/august-0807/the-decline-and-fall-of-declinism |title=The Decline and Fall of Declinism |publisher=American.com |accessdate=March 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100129075119/http://www.american.com/archive/2007/august-0807/the-decline-and-fall-of-declinism| archivedate= January 29, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Matthew Parris]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in London wrote that the United States is "overstretched", romantically recalling the Kennedy presidency, when "America had the best arguments" and could use moral [[persuasion]] rather than force to have its way in the world. From his vantage point in Shanghai, the ''International Herald Tribune''{{'}}s [[Howard W. French|Howard French]] worries about "the declining moral influence of the United States" over an emergent China.&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/declinism.html |title=Three Centuries of American Declinism |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''The Post-American World'', ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor [[Fareed Zakaria]] refers to a "Post-American world" that he says "is not about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else".&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria, Fareed, ''The Post-American World''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-670-08229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similarities between the U.S. and Europe ===
In December 2009, historian [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]] published a book arguing that, despite widespread attempts to contrast the '[[American way of life]]' and the '[[European social model]]', America and Europe are actually very similar to a number of social and economic indices. Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of those few areas where a stark difference exists between the U.S. and Europe, such as homicide and child poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/81ba6ffa-ed90-11de-ba12-00144feab49a,s01=1.html|title=Financial Times|last=Lloyd|first=John|date=December 20, 2009|work=Martian myths that flatter Europe|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]] argues that it be commonly thought that all people consider themselves exceptional. In most cases in which this subject has been broached the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences. Things such as the "dynamic wealth creation, the democracy, the accessibility of opportunity, the cult of civil liberty, the tradition of tolerance," and what Fernández-Armesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy, the excessive privileges of wealth, and the selective illiberality are standard features in many modern societies. However, he adds, America is made exceptional by the intensity with which these characteristics are concentrated there.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto, Felipe. ''The Americas: A Hemispheric History''. New York: Modern Library, 2003. p. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current official stance and its detractors ==
In April 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] responded to a journalist's question in Strasbourg with the statement, "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kirchick28-2009apr28,0,4218519.story |title=Squanderer in chief |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2010 | first=James | last=Kirchick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama further noted that "I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040400700.html |title=On European Trip, President Tries to Set a New, Pragmatic Tone |work=The Washington Post |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2010 | first=Michael| last=Sheer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitt Romney]] attacked Obama's statement, arguing it showed Obama did not believe in American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitt Romney|title=No Apology: The Case for American Greatness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDpBpo5CVB4C&amp;pg=PA29|year= 2010|publisher=Macmillan|page=29|isbn=978-1-4299-3960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Arkansas Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] said that Obama's "worldview is dramatically different from any president, Republican or Democrat, we've had... He grew up more as a globalist than an American. To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith, "The New Battle: What It Means to be American," August 20, 2010, [www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41273.html.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on the [[Syrian civil war|Syria crisis]] on September 10, 2013, Obama said: "however, when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our kids safer over the long run, I believe we should act... That is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Tumulty, "American exceptionalism, explained", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/12/american-exceptionalism-explained/?hpid=z10 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In a direct response the next day, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] published an [[op-ed]] in ''The New York Times'', articulating that "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."&lt;ref&gt;Max Fisher, "Vladimir Putin's New York Times op-ed, annotated and fact-checked", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/09/12/vladimir-putins-new-york-times-op-ed-annotated-and-fact-checked/?hpid=z1 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Putin's views were soon endorsed by future president [[Donald Trump]] who declared the op-ed "a masterpiece": "You think of the term as being beautiful, but all of sudden you say, what if you're in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You are not going to like that term," Trump said. "It is very insulting, and Putin put it to him about that."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Kirchick|Kirchik, James]] (15 August 2016), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/15/beware-the-hillary-clinton-loathing-donald-trump-loving-useful-idiots-of-the-left.html?via=newsletter&amp;source=CSAMedition "Beware the Hillary Clinton-Loathing, Donald Trump-Loving Useful Idiots of the Left"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some left-wing American commentators agree with Trump's stance; one example is Sherle Schwenninger, a co-founder of the [[New America Foundation]], who in a 2016 ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' magazine symposium remarked that "Trump would redefine American exceptionalism by bringing an end to the neoliberal/neoconservative globalist project that [[Hillary Clinton]] and many Republicans support".&lt;ref&gt;Schwenninger, Sherle R., Heather Hurlburt, [[Stephen Kinzer]] and [[Juan Cole]] (24 May 2016),

{{Forms of government}}
{{Neo-fascism}}

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

Research shows that the democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government. Those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. J. Rummel |author-link=R. J.

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P.

There is no precise definition of authoritarianism, but several annual measurements are attempted, including [[Freedom House]]’s annual [[Freedom in the World]] report.

===Current===
The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of states which are currently (or frequently) characterized as authoritarian:

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

Regimes were toppled in  [[Tunisia]] [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]], and other countries saw riots, civil wars or insurgencies.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014415/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">In 1772, three [[Stirling burgh]] councillors signed a secret agreement to run the affairs of the town to their own advantage. This private pact to advance their own power and finance came to be known as the '''Black Bond'''.

The discovery of the agreement led to the [[burgh]] being put under the supervision of a central government [[Commission (government)|commission]] in 1775.

[[File:Black Sash.jpg|thumb|Black Sash demonstration between 1955 and 1960]]
The '''Black Sash''' was a non-violent liberal white women's resistance organisation that was founded on 19 May 1955 in [[South Africa]] by Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza, and Helen Newton-Thompson.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/our-legacy/our-history |title=The Beginning of the Sash 1955-1956 |access-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426012713/http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/our-legacy/our-history |archive-date=2015-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Black Sash was founded on 19 May 1955 by six middle-class women, Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; The organisation was founded as the ''Women’s Defence of the Constitution League'' but was eventually shortened by the press as the Black Sash due to the women's habit of wearing black sashes at their protest meetings.&lt;ref name="Villa"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spirit of Freedom: South African Leaders on Religion and Politics | publisher=University of California Press | author=Villa-Vicencio, Charles | year=1996 | isbn=978-0520200456}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} These black sashes symbolised the mourning for the South Africa Constitution.&lt;ref name=Villa/&gt;{{rp|79}} The founding members gathered for tea in Johannesburg before they decided to organise a movement against the Senate Act. They succeeded to hold a vigil of 2 000 women who marched from [[Joubert Park]] to the [[Johannesburg City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/Publications/Black%20Sash%20book.pdf|title=STANDING ON STREET CORNERS|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Sash initially campaigned against the removal of [[Coloured]] or mixed race voters from the voters' roll in the [[Cape Province]] by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government. As the [[apartheid]] system began to reach into every aspect of South African life, Black Sash members demonstrated against the [[Pass Laws]] and the introduction of other apartheid legislation. It would later open Advice Offices to provide information concerning their legal rights to non-white South African's affected by that legislation.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ynOFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=black+sash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinoLnY0cveAhXLR30KHSXoCDo4FBDoAQg4MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20sash&amp;f=false|title=Women, Ethnicity and Nationalism: The Politics of Transition|last=Miller|first=Robert E.|last2=Wilford|first2=Rick|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9781134695492|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Its members "''used the relative safety of their privileged racial classification to speak out against the erosion of human rights in the country. Their striking black sashes were worn as a mark of mourning and to protest against the succession of unjust laws. But they were not only on the streets. Volunteers spent many hours in the national network of advice offices and in the monitoring of courts and pass offices.''" (Speech by Marcella Naidoo, National Director of the Black Sash, June 2005)

Between 1955 and 1994, the Black Sash provided widespread and visible proof of white resistance towards the apartheid system. Its members worked as volunteer advocates to families affected by apartheid laws; held regular street demonstrations; spoke at political meetings; brought cases of injustice to the attention of their Members of Parliament, and kept vigils outside Parliament and government offices. Many members were vilified within their local white communities, and it was not unusual for women wearing the black sash to be physically attacked by supporters of apartheid.

In the 1980s it was part of the National Land Committee assisting the non-white communities that were subject to forced land removals.&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt;{{rp|61}} It would also be involved on the Rural Women's Movement, supporting rural non-white women rights in regards to inheritance and land ownership.&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt;{{rp|61}} In 1983, the organisation called for the abolition of military conscription.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOHHNsobjPIC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=the+black+sash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHrM7ZtqzYAhXJuxQKHadjDUkQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20black%20sash&amp;f=false|title=Women in South African History: They Remove Boulders and Cross Rivers|last=Gasa|first=Nomboniso|date=2007|publisher=HSRC Press|year=|isbn=9780796921741|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Apartheid==
The Black Sash's resistance movement came to an end in the early 1990s with the end of apartheid, the unbanning of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and the release of [[Nelson Mandela]] from imprisonment. Its role was recognised by Nelson Mandela on his release and by subsequent political leaders. The organisation was reformed in 1995 as a non-racial humanitarian organisation, working to 'make human rights real for all living in South Africa'.

In May 2015, the organisation celebrated its 60th anniversary as it shifted its focus towards education, training, advocacy and community monitoring. The celebration of the Black Sash history was also marked by the launching of two books, namely ''Standing on Street Corners: a History of the Natal Midlands Region of the Black Sash'' and ''a'' biography by Annemarie Hendrikz''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-05-14-the-conscience-of-white-south-africa-celebrating-the-black-sash-60-years-later/#.WkS97t8oRhE|title=‘The conscience of white South Africa’: Celebrating the Black Sash, 60 years later {{!}} Daily Maverick|website=www.dailymaverick.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1660">"Conservative" or "bourgeois socialism" was a term used by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in various pieces, including in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. The [[Marxism|Marxian]] view is such that the bourgeois socialist is the sustainer of the [[Marx's theory of the state#The bourgeois state|current state of bourgeois class relations]]. Opinions vary as to whether this or that bourgeois socialist intentionally is excusing the current order, but the common thread is that they are in objective fact preserving it. Rather than abolishing [[Social class|class divisions]], they wish to simply raise everyone up to be a member of the [[bourgeoisie]] to allow everyone the ability to endlessly accumulate [[Capital (economics)|capital]] without a [[working class]]. In ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx and Engels use [[Philanthropy|philanthropists]], [[monk]]s ("temperance fanatics") and [[Reform movement|reformers]] as examples of this type of [[Socialism|socialist]] that they saw as opposed to their own aims. In expressing its views on the subject, Marx explicitly referenced [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s ''[[The Philosophy of Misery]]'', stating the following about bourgeois socialism: {{cquote|The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">'''CRP-2B''' ('''Crisis Relocation Program 2B''') is a hypothetical scenario of [[nuclear war]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] that was created in 1976 by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].  It involved the detonation of 1444 weapons, with a yield of 6559 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]]s, and projected an American death toll of between 85 and 125 [[megadeath]]s.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|title=Mission Improbable|author=Lee Ben Clarke|pages=36|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|isbn=0-226-10941-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medical Implications of Nuclear War|author=Fredric Solomon and Robert Q. Marston|pages=590|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1986|isbn=0-309-03636-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRP-2B predicts a "[[countervalue]]" attack (an attack targeting cities instead of military and industrial infrastructure).

The program was referred to as a "study", but in fact it was the product of a computer simulation.  It was also the source of an 80% survival rate figure that was quoted by many people in the years afterwards.  The 80% survival rate was an initial assumption, built into the parameters of the computer simulation by its designers. The assumption stems from the conditions of the scenario, with historical precendence in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]: FEMA assumes that the nuclear exchange would be preceded by 3–5 days of "heightened tensions" that would give Americans time to evacuate major cities.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/lib-www/la-pubs/00173165.pdf |title=NUCLEAR WINTER: THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF HUMAN SURVIVAL |last1=Bumstead |first1=Pamela |date=December 6, 1985 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |location=Washington, DC |conference=84th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association
 |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But as the program came to be a "study", so the survival rate figure came to be the "finding" of the study.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

Charles F. Estes Jr., director of strategic police at the Office of the Undersecretary of Defence for Policy, stated:&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;
{{quote|text=It was assumed at the outset that 80 percent of the population of hypothesized target areas would in fact have been evacuated and would survive.  [&amp;hellip;] [T]his was an entering assumption rather than one of the study's analytically derived findings. [&amp;hellip;] It is importance to note that the survivability assumptions [&amp;hellip;] of the computer model were derived from opinions of interested civil defense program managers, academics, and contractor personnel  These opinions were obtained through the use of accepted opinion survey techniques.|sign=Charles F. Estes Jr.|source=&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;&lt;ref name=LeaningKeyes&gt;{{cite book|title=Counterfeit Ark: Crisis Relocation for Nuclear War|author=Jennifer Leaning and Langley Carleton Keyes|publisher=Ballinger Pub. Co.|year=1983|isbn=0-88410-940-2|pages=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This 80% figure was quoted in the 1980s by U.S. congresspeople and other officials.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

== Criticism ==
The 80% survival rate assumption has since came under significant criticism from academics and organizations like the [[Federation of American Scientists]] (FAS). FAS criticized CRP-2B for failing to consider the potential ecological impacts of nuclear war, including [[nuclear winter]], disruptions to agriculture, and the radioactive contamination of water supplies. It further criticized CRP-2B for studying only direct and immediate consequences of the attacks, ignoring the long-term threats to human health posed by [[ionizing radiation]] and social problems caused by breakdowns in law and order, strife between relocated populations and host communities, and disruptions to the supply of medical equipment.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt; [[Stanford University]] radiologist and anti-nuclear activist [[Herbert L. Abrams]] was particularly critical of the scenario's assumptions regarding the injured. He noted that hospitals would quickly be overwhelmed by the number of victims, particularly burn victims, who already face shortages of beds, medical personnel, and resources. Abrams estimated that because 80% of hospitals are in urban areas and would so be destroyed in the attack, there would 1 bed for every 563 severely injured patients. Hospitals would face similar post-attack shortages for blood, plasma, and other fluids and drugs and bandages, which would prevent effective treatment of the wounded and patients with chronic illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert L. Abrams|editor1-last=Marston|editor1-first=Solomon|title=The Medical Implications of Nuclear War|date=1986|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|location=Washington, DC|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219179/|accessdate=25 April 2018|chapter=Medical Supply and Demand in a Post-Nuclear-War World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account these impacts on medical facilities, Abrams estimates that only 60 million Americans would survive in the CRP-2B scenario, before nuclear winter, social strife, and disruptions to the food supply are considered.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt;

'''Caesaropapism''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|z|ər|oʊ|ˈ|p|eɪ|p|ɪ|z|əm}} is the idea of combining the [[power (social and political) | power]] of [[secularity|secular]] government with the religious power, or of making secular authority superior to the spiritual authority of the Church; especially concerning the connection of the Church with government. [[Justus Henning Böhmer]] (1674–1749) may have originally coined the term ''[[Wiktionary:caesaropapism|caesaropapism]]'' (''Cäseropapismus'').&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pennington, "Caesaropapism," The New Catholic Encyclopedia: Supplement 2010 (2 Vols.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920) wrote: "a secular, caesaropapist ruler... exercises supreme authority in ecclesiastic matters by virtue of his autonomous legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;

In its extreme form, caesaropapism is a political theory in which the head of state, notably the emperor ("Caesar", by extension a "superior" king), is also the supreme head of the church (pope or analogous religious leader). In this form, caesaropapism inverts [[theocracy]] (or [[hierocracy]] in Weber) in which institutions of the church control the state. Both caesaropapism and theocracy are systems in which there is no [[separation of church and state]] and in which the two form parts of a single power-structure.

==Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church==

Caesaropapism's chief example is the authority that the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[List of Byzantine emperors|(East Roman) Emperors]] had over the [[Church of Constantinople]] and [[Eastern Christianity]] from the 330 consecration of [[Constantinople]] through the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Cross | first1 = F.L.| last2 = Livingstone | first2 = E.A.| title = Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1983| location = Oxford| pages = [http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/ChurchHistory220/LectureTwo/caesaropapism.htm 218]| edition = 2nd

==Caesaropapism in the Western Church==
[[File:San Vitale Ravenna.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], Italy combines Western and Byzantine elements.]]{{main|Byzantine Papacy}}

[[Justinian I]] conquered the Italian peninsula in the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and [[papal selection before 1059|appointed the next three popes]], a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The ''Byzantine Papacy'' was a period of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] domination of the [[pope|papacy]] from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] for [[consecration#Roman Catholic Church|episcopal consecration]], and many popes were chosen from the ''[[apocrisiarius|apocrisiarii]]'' (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of [[Byzantine Greece]], [[Byzantine Syria]], or [[History of Sicily#Byzantine period|Byzantine Sicily]].

===Analogue in the Church of England===

When [[Henry VIII of England]] declared the [[Church of England]] to exist as an entity separate from and independent of the Roman Church, he declared himself to be the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|"Supreme Head" of that church]], to which declaration the English Parliament acceded by passing the [[Act of Supremacy 1534]] at Henry's behest. When [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] restored royal supremacy, she replaced the title "Supreme Head" with that of "[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]", a change both conciliatory to English Catholics on a political level and reflecting a shift toward a more metaphysically and theologically modest stance involving only a claim to supreme authority over the Church of England's conduct in temporal matters. Since then, the monarchs of England, of Great Britain, and of the United Kingdom have claimed the "Supreme Governor" status as well as the title of ''[[fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]'' (which was originally bestowed on Henry VIII by [[Pope Leo X]] but later revoked by [[Pope Paul III]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5042">A '''Citizens’ Initiative Review''' (CIR) is modeled on the [[Citizens’ jury]] and is a form of [[deliberative democracy]].  A panel of citizens meets to deliberate on a ballot [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] that voters in the same jurisdiction (such as a city, state, province, or country) will be deciding in an upcoming election.  The panelists are chosen through means such as [[random sampling]] and [[stratified sampling]] to be demographically representative of the relevant population.  To ensure that the panel is a manageable size for face-to-face deliberation, a CIR caps the number of participants at around two dozen.  They are often paid for their time and travel so that the broadest possible range of citizens can participate.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, only the state of Oregon has passed a law to enact a permanent version of the CIR.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Richards, “Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt; The states of Colorado, Arizona, and Massachusetts have conducted pilot tests of the CIR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirmass2016.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpr.org/news/story/experiment-help-voters-understand-colorado-ballot-measures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/files/2015/01/CIR-2016-Arizona-Report-26npu2z.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The operations of a CIR are typically assisted by a moderator who is trained to ensure that all panelists engage in the deliberations.  Over the course of a few days, the panelists not only deliberate among themselves but also question policy experts and advocates on both sides of the initiative.  The panelists write a statement describing their deliberations in a form that can be publicized though means such as including it in the voter’s pamphlet.  This statement summarizes what the panelists believed were the best arguments pro and con, and it lists the number of panelists who recommended voting both for and against the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Richards, “Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Consistent with other forms of deliberative democracy, a CIR tries to strengthen the quality and impact of the public voice in elections and government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.natcom.org/communication-currents/evaluating-new-governing-institution-assessment-citizens%E2%80%99-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;  The CIR addresses specific concerns about initiative campaigns where voters often receive little information at all, or else what they hear—for example, from paid advertisements—is biased or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;John Gastil, “Beyond Endorsements and Partisan Cues:  Given Voters Viable Alternaties to Unreliable Cognitive Shortcuts” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/Gastil-2014-Beyond-Endorsements-and-Partisan-Cues-Giving-Vote.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Under a CIR, voters learn what a representative body of citizens thought about the initiative after studying it carefully and deliberating among themselves.  

==Evaluation==
Academic research shows that the panelists in the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review have achieved high-quality deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch, John Gastil, Justin Reedy, and Katherine Cramer Walsh, “Did They Deliberate? Applying an Evaluative Model of Democratic Deliberation to the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/DidTheyDeliberate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Voters became aware of those deliberations through the voters’ pamphlet and found the panelists’ statement to be helpful to their decisions, and voter knowledge about the initiatives increased as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch, John Gastil, Traci Feller, and Robert C. Richards, “Empowering Citizen Deliberation in Direct Democratic Elections: A Field Study of the 2012 Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://factsreports.revues.org/3448&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists themselves developed new attitudes about the political process and their own capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch and John Gastil, “Civic (Re)socialisation: The Educative Effects of Deliberative Participation” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/Civic-resocialization.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Informing the voting public of what the panelists recommended, rather than just summarizing the pro and con arguments that panelists found most persuasive, may short-circuit voters’ own deliberations by allowing them to simply adopt the panelists’ recommendation. &lt;ref&gt;James Fishkin, "Deliberation by the People Themselves:  Entry Points for the Public Voice" http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2013.0200&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8577">'''Come-outer''' is a phrase coined in the 1830s which denotes a person who withdraws from an established organization, or one who advocates political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Come-outer ''Come-outer''] Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was first applied during the [[Second Great Awakening]] to a small group of American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who dissented from religious orthodoxy, who withdrew from a number of established churches because the churches were not progressive enough on the issue of abolition. A come-outer would not join a church which held a neutral position on the issue of slavery, and he would not vote, or run for office, or otherwise take part in a government that let slavery happen. The phrase was derived from the [[Bible]] verse, II Corinthians 6:17 which read "Wherefore '''come out''' from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."&lt;ref&gt;Von Frank, Albert J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7f249hSwsC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338 ''The trials of Anthony Burns,'' p. 338.] Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garrisonian anti-institutionalism===
[[William Lloyd Garrison]] was an influential [[Boston]] abolitionist who founded the [[New England Anti-Slavery Society]] and the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] in the early 1830s. Garrison advocated an immediate end to slavery, rather than a step-by-step process working through the political system. In 1832, he printed an anti-slavery tract called ''Thoughts on African Colonization'' which included the "come out from among them" verse from the [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]], and a quote from a recently deceased Reverend Doctor Thomson of [[Edinburgh]]: "To say that we will only come out of the sin by degrees—that we will only forsake it slowly, and step by step... is to trample on the demands of moral obligation..."&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, William Lloyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KcsNAAAAQAAJ ''Thoughts on African Colonization: or An Impartial Exhibition of the Doctrines, Principles and Purposes of the American Colonization Society, together with the Resolutions, Addresses and Remonstrances of the Free People of Color'']. Garrison and Knapf, 1832, pages 24 and 87.&lt;/ref&gt; At the New England Anti-Slavery Convention in 1836, Garrison proposed that only churches willing to help fight slavery should be considered "the true and real church of God."&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;Putnam, Mary Burnham. [https://archive.org/stream/baptistsslavery102putn/baptistsslavery102putn_djvu.txt ''The Baptists and Slavery, 1840–1845'']. George Wahr, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], 1913. Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed by many as too divisive, so other means were tried until the 1837 convention when a resolution was adopted urging abolitionists to leave unresponsive churches, "to come out from among them and be separate."&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt; Garrison's radical ideas defined a strong split within the anti-slavery societies, and Garrison was abandoned by all but a dedicated core group of like-minded abolitionists. The Boston-based group of reformers began to be called "come-outers".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226208/William-Lloyd-Garrison ''William Lloyd Garrison'']. Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison's newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', served to spread his view of abolition and anti-institutionalism. From time to time, news items about come-outers would appear, some culled from other journals. In 1851, Garrison quoted an article entitled "Come-outers in jail" which appeared in ''[[The Barnstable Patriot]]'': "Several of these poor deluded beings in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], whose actions we have before noticed, are now on trial in that town for an assault upon a constable when in the discharge of his duty…the poor creatures are insane, and can hardly be held responsible for their acts.  ….the most fitting place for these unfortunate beings is in the [[Psychiatric hospital|Insane Hospital]]."&lt;ref name=jail&gt;''The Liberator'', January 31, 1851. [http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/come-outers-in-jail/ ''Come-outers in jail'']. Retrieved on April 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison offered his opinion that the 'poor deluded beings' were quite properly "laboring under religious insanity."&lt;ref name=jail/&gt;

Other regions of the [[United States]] that held pockets of "'''come-outerism'''" included [[Cape Cod]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

===Abolition and church reform===
Come-outers themselves split further into those who, like Garrison, were against any institution at all, and those who believed that political systems and churches could be reformed into anti-slavery organizations. Non-Garrisonian come-outers split from [[Methodist]], [[Baptist]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches to form new church doctrines that were either completely free of slavery or focused on anti-slavery. The American Baptist Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 brought the issue to the fore, defining a split among Baptists.&lt;ref name=Ferrell/&gt; The [[American Baptist Free Mission Society]] formed in 1843 in Boston when 17 Baptists led by [[William Henry Brisbane]] left their church to create a non-racist, anti-slavery evangelical group with missions to Haiti, Burma and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Cathcart, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-zWuEM-qHMC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 ''The Baptist Encyclopaedia''], Volume 1 of 3, 1881, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James G. Birney]] and [[Gerrit Smith]] were among those who left the Presbyterian church.&lt;ref name=Ferrell&gt;Ferrell, Claudine L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mG_MNzwawSAC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75 ''The Abolitionist Movement''], Greenwood Press, 2006. pp. 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated [[American Missionary Association]], a non-denominational group, formed in 1846 mostly of Presbyterian and Congregational members who were unable to get their churches to commit to fight slavery. The [[Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] was organized in 1843 and grew to some 15,000 members, many of whom were not Methodist.&lt;ref name=Ferrell/&gt; By 1850, membership in come-outer churches, combined with those in religious denominations such as [[Free Will Baptist]] who had long been against slavery, reached 241,000 in America.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Julie Roy.

===Tax resistance===
Some come-outers engaged in [[tax resistance]] because of their unwillingness to fund a government that did not work to end slavery. [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] both used tax resistance in this way. Utopian [[Brook Farm]] has been described as "a come-outer enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Darrel.

Command-and-control management is categorised by systems thinkers as the dominant method of management in the Western world. Key influences are said to include [[Alfred P. Sloan]], [[Henry Ford]], [[James O. McKinsey|James McKinsey]] of the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|eponymous accounting firm]], and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. A well-known modern exponent is [[Michael Barber (educationist)|Michael Barber]], himself a partner in McKinsey &amp; Company.

It is characterised by some systems thinkers according to the following attributes:

'''Perspective''': Top-down and hierarchical&lt;br /&gt;
'''Design''': Organisations divided into (ostensibly) independent functional silos. A practice propagated by Alfred Sloan and James McKinsey&lt;br /&gt;
'''Decision-making''': Separated from work. A separation spearheaded by Frederick Winslow Taylor&lt;br /&gt;
'''Measures''': Arbitrary targets analysed by binary comparison&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ethos''': Control of staff&lt;br /&gt;
'''Change''': Plans delivered by Prince II methodology&lt;br /&gt;
'''Motivation''': Control-by-seduction (carrot) and control-by-fear (stick)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Attitude to suppliers and customers''': Contractual.

Key critics of the command-and-control management ethos and techniques include members of the systems-thinking community and associated thinkers, including [[W. Edwards Deming]],&lt;ref&gt;''Out of the Crisis'', W. Edwards Deming, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Seddon]],&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom from Command and Control'', John Seddon, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kōnosuke Matsushita]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vanguard-method.net/library/management-thinkers/konosuke-matsushita/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiichi Ohno]], [[Russell L. Ackoff]],&lt;ref&gt;''Management f-Laws'', Russell Ackoff, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donella Meadows]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking in Systems'', Donella Meadows, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfie Kohn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Punished by Rewards'', Alfie Kohn, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and the outspoken [[The Vanguard Method|Vanguard Method]] practitioner John Little.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/11/snouts-in-the-trough-outsourcing-farm.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century John Seddon in particular has been deeply critical of successive [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK governments]]' propagation of command-and-control thinking in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], local authorities, and other public services.

Organisations credited with having moved away from the command-and-control paradigm to a systems-thinking philosophy include [[Harley Davidson]] and [[Aviva]], in addition to many Japanese companies, such as [[Toyota]], [[Honda]], and [[Panasonic]].

'''Communist Marxist Party (John)''' is one of the splinter factions of  [[Communist Marxist Party]] led by [[CP John]]. The party is allied with [[United Democratic Front (Kerala)|United Democratic Front]] in [[Kerala]].

The CMP was part of the [[United Democratic Front (India)|United Democratic Front]], an alliance in Kerala which is led by the [[Indian National Congress]]. In March 2014, the party split and the faction led by C. P. John continued in the UDF while the faction led by K. R. Aravindakshan, which had the support of M. V. Raghavan, decided to cooperate with the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]] although it was not officially inducted into the front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cmp-splits-one-faction-moves-to-ldf/article5819901.ece "CMP splits, one faction moves to LDF"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17215">[[Civic technology]] is defined as technology that enables engagement, participation or enhances the relationship between the people and government by enhancing citizen communications and public decision, improving government delivery of service, and infrastructure. Civic technology platforms specifically designed to improve citizen participation in governance. We distinguished civic tech from government technology. Government technology being technology that directly deals with government infrastructure.

== Platform types ==

We used the categorization on democratic innovations according to Dr. Graham Smith of the [[University of Southampton]], in his book "Beyond the Ballot":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/11541/|title=Beyond the ballot: 57 democratic innovations from around the world|last=Smith|first=Graham|date=2005|website=westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk|publisher=POWER Inquiry|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electoral innovations - "aim to increase electoral turnout"
* Consultation innovations - "aim to inform decision-makers of citizens’ views" 
* Deliberative innovations - "aim to bring citizens together to deliberate on policy issues, the outcomes of which may influence decision-makers"
* Co-governance innovations - "aim to give citizens significant influence during the process of decision-making" 
* Direct democracy innovations - "aim to give citizens final decision-making power on key issues" 
* E-democracy innovations - "use information technology to engage citizens in the decision-making process"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">A '''compulsory purchase order''' ('''CPO''') is a legal function in the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] that allows certain bodies which need to obtain land or property to do so without the consent of the owner. It may be enforced if a proposed development is considered one for public betterment; for example, when building [[motorway]]s where a land owner does not want to sell. Similarly, if [[town council]]s wish to develop a town centre, they may issue compulsory purchase orders. CPOs can also be used to acquire historic buildings in order to preserve them from neglect.

In Ireland, CPOs became quite common in the early 21st century due to the massive road upgrade programme under the [[National Development Plan]]. CPOs are also used for railway projects. If one objects to the issuing of a CPO, one may appeal to the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0021/sec0078.html Housing Act 1966 (ROI)]&lt;/ref&gt; Compensation is available to ensure that the person is restored, as far as possible, to the same position that they were in before the land and property were compulsorily purchased, so that the person is left in the same financial position after the CPO as they were in before the process.&lt;ref name="urlCompulsory Purchase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing_your_home/compulsory_purchase_and_compensation.html |title=Compulsory Purchase |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, most Orders are made as subordinate legislation under powers given to Local Authorities in existing legislation (e.g. an Order for road works is made under the Highways Act 1980). Whilst the powers are strong, the Authority must demonstrate that the taking of the land is necessary and there is a "compelling case in the public interest". Owners or occupiers can challenge this, and their objection will be heard by an independent Inspector.

Compensation rights usually include the value of the property, costs of acquiring and moving to a new property, and sometimes additional payments. Costs of professional advice regarding compensation are usually reimbursed by the Authority, so that people affected by a compulsory purchase order can seek advice from a [[solicitor]] and a [[surveying|surveyor]] and expect to be reimbursed.

[[File:Madonna à Nice 24.jpg|thumb|Madonna courted a number of controversies while performing throughout [[The MDNA Tour]]]]
American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was embroiled with a number of controversy during [[The MDNA Tour]]. It was her ninth [[concert tour]], promoting her twelfth studio album, ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'' (2012). The tour has generated many newspaper headlines and news coverage for its use of fake firearms during performances, Madonna's nudity on stage, and her promotion of [[LGBT]] rights, [[freedom of speech]] and political issues.

Madonna was threatened with a lawsuit in [[France]] for using an image of [[French people|French]] [[far-right]] politician [[Marine Le Pen]] with a [[swastika]] on her forehead during a video interlude and also in [[Russia]] for her promotion of the rights of the LGBT community by giving free pink wristbands to people attending her concert.

At the performance in Nice, France at the Stade Charles-Ehrmann, many of Le Pen's supporters had covered up The MDNA Tour announcement posters with Le Pen's campaign posters. It was even speculated that French far right was to attend the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madonnaunderground.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2797%3Afront-national-aanwezig-bij-mdna-in-nice&amp;catid=22%3Aalgemeen&amp;lang=en |title=Front National attending MDNA in Nice? |publisher=Madonnaunderground.nl |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Madonna removed the swastika from the video of "Nobody Knows Me" and replaced it with a question mark. A local party supporter Gael Nofri welcomed the change stating: "As far as I know, Madonna has never changed a video clip. This is proof that our arguments were valid. This is excellent news." Nevertheless, after that performance, Madonna has used the original video clip. Madonna later defended her use of the swastika image, stating she did it to raise awareness of ever growing intolerance towards religious minorities and immigrants (the National Front is [[Opposition to immigration|against immigration]].)

Madonna has been a strong supporter of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a "Black Muslim" which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim&amp;nbsp;— though I know that plenty of people in this country think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is&amp;nbsp;— nor should anyone else in America."&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/madonna-obama-black-muslim_n_1912400.html | title= Madonna: Obama Is 'A Black Muslim In The White House,' Deserves Votes (VIDEO) [UPDATE] |work=The Huffington Post |date=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience.  However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience.  Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, "I don't care who you vote for.  Do not take this great privilege for granted." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-madonna-obama-boos-concert-new-orleans,0,2837761.story|title=Madonna booed (and cheered) after Obama endorsement in New Orleans|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to [[Malala Yousafzai]], a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the [[Taliban]] for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog ... who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her ... Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" Madonna went on to shout, "Support education! Support the people who support women!"  Madonna showed the audience a written tattoo on her back with Malala's name on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertram|first=Colin|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/entertainment/celebrity/Madonna-Offers-Onstage-Support-to-Malala-the-Pakistani-Teen-Shot-by-the-Taliban-173940881.html|title=Madonna Dedicates Song to "Malala," the Pakistani Teen Shot by Taliban Gunmen|publisher=NBC Chicago|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Madonna performing "[[Gang Bang (song)|Gang Bang]]" during the show's first segment, This performance received negative backlash due to the involvement of firearms]]
In the first section of the show, Madonna performs with fake firearms during the first three songs. She begins with  "[[Girl Gone Wild]]" holding a rifle and "breaks" the glass, of a confessional box, she later performs "[[Revolver (song)|Revolver]]" with female dancers dancing with automatic rifles. During the third song, "[[Gang Bang (song)|Gang Bang]]" she performed in a motel setting where she is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops.&lt;ref name=perez&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilton|first=Perez|title=Madonna Kicks Off MDNA Tour!

Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in [[Colorado]]. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, with the use of the props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, "Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write to your local [[Member of parliament|MP]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2012/07/22/pop-superstar-madonna-ignores-gun-ban-as-she-plays-scots-gig-86908-23911281/ |title=Pop superstar Madonna ignores gun ban as she plays Scots gig |author=Lyons, Beverly|date=July 22, 2012 |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079499GTIVONUSYZ?url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2012/07/22/pop-superstar-madonna-ignores-gun-ban-as-she-plays-scots-gig-86908-23911281/ |archivedate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although threatened, Scottish police did not interrupt the show. Activist group, Mothers Against Guns, released a statement stating Madonna "should know better". They further stated the use of the props are in bad taste, even more so after the Colorado shootings. The singer's camp responded saying, "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She’s not about to start listening to them now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/madonna-guns-concert-photos_n_1694766.html |title=Madonna &amp; Guns: Singer Brandishes Fake Pistols &amp; Machine Guns Despite Warnings, Recent Events (PHOTOS) |author=Makarechi, Kia |date=July 23, 2012 |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079799NJKZPFOOWU?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/madonna-guns-concert-photos_n_1694766.html|archivedate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her concert in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], many fans felt the pop star was being "insensitive" to the community with the use of firearms in the first act. Many concert-goers tweeted the act was "too dark" and "[[Satanism|satanic]]", causing them to leave the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdvr.com/2012/10/19/twitter-madonna-over-2-hours-late-to-denver-show-fakes-shooting-audience/ |title=Madonna over 2 hours late to Denver show, pretends to shoot audience |publisher=KDVR |date=October 19, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To comment on the story, Liz Rosenberg released the following statement: "It's like taking out the third act of Hamlet.

Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna "as a positive role model for older women." While some initially claimed Madonna as "clingy" and "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, "I felt nervous when I pulled my bra down but that’s only natural&amp;nbsp;— Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, it was an incredible feeling." She goes on to say about Madonna, "She looks incredible now&amp;nbsp;— better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna "will not change" despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4371665/Madonna-was-right-to-bare-her-boob-at-53.html|title=Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53 |author=Williams, Stewart |date=June 11, 2012 |work=The Sun |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343081055QQXYPSKVBO?url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4371665/Madonna-was-right-to-bare-her-boob-at-53.html|archivedate=July 23, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==L'Olympia show==
Madonna's second show in Paris at [[L'Olympia]] was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics, with most of the criticism centering on the fact that the concert lasted only 45 minutes, even though the tickets had been sold at the same price as for the others full stage MDNA Tour shows and fans had not been alerted of the abbreviated format of the show. Responding to the criticism, Madonna's publicist declared that her past club shows "were never more than 45 minutes", adding that the concert was "planned as a heartfelt thank you to France which she expressed at the start of the show" and also, the show cost Madonna nearly $1 million to produce and keeping the prices at $100 involved a "tremendous effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/music/2012/07/28/madonna-booed-after-45-minute-paris-concert |title=Madonna booed after 45-minute Paris concert |work=Sunday Times (Johannesburg) |date=July 28, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TMZ, the riot at Madonna concert in Paris had nothing to do with her brief performance but with around 10 "fans" in the audience who overheard yelling about Marine Le Pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.tmz.com/article_head.ftl?id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2012%2F07%2F29%2Fmadonna-france-concert-riot%2F |title=TMZ |publisher=M.tmz.com |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several French news outlets reported that the backlash against Madonna's performance was started by a considerable number of fans rather than an isolated group of Marine Le Pen supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/actu-people/madonna-conspuee-sur-le-web-apres-son-concert-a-l-olympia-27-07-2012-2104458.php|title=Madonna conspuée sur le Web après son concert à L'Olympia|date=July 27, 2012 |work=[[Le Parisien]]  |accessdate=July 27, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI?url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/mdna-audience-bears-witness-to-madonnas-inner-turmoil |archivedate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2012/07/27/03006-20120727ARTFIG00530-madonna-sur-twitter-la-reine-est-morte.php|title=Madonna sur Twitter: "La Reine est Morte |date=July 27, 2012 |work=[[Le Figaro]] |accessdate=July 27, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI?url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/mdna-audience-bears-witness-to-madonnas-inner-turmoil |archivedate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Musique/News/Madonna-huee-par-ses-fans-apres-son-concert-a-l-Olympia-2130804 |title=Madonna huée par ses fans après son concert à L'Olympia |work=Elle |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of speech==
[[File:Pussy Riot_- Denis Bochkarev 5.jpg|thumb|left|Madonna called for the release of Russian [[Feminism in Russia|feminist]] [[punk-rock]] band [[Pussy Riot]]]]
Madonna's Russian shows in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] were met with great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band [[Pussy Riot]], Madonna responded: "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always promoted freedom of expression and [[freedom of speech]] so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; that would be a tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/9458246/Madonna-calls-for-leniency-in-Pussy-Riot-trial-during-Russian-leg-of-world-tour.html |title=Video: Madonna calls for leniency in Pussy Riot trial during Russian leg of world tour |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her [[Moscow]] show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/08/madonna-pussy-riot-moscow-video |title=Madonna shows support for Pussy Riot at Moscow concert&amp;nbsp;– video |work=The Guardian |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Madonna later appeared on stage with a [[temporary tattoo]] that said "Pussy Riot" on her back in place of the usual "No Fear" slogan, and performed "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/08/08/madonna-supports-pussy-riot_n_1755804.html |title=Madonna Dons Pussy Riot's Trademark Balaclava To Show Support In Moscow, Russia (PICTURES) |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/madonna-dons-balaclava-in-moscow-to-show-support-for-anti-putin-punk-band-1.907178 |title=Madonna dons balaclava in Moscow to show support for jailed members of punk band Pussy Riot |publisher=Yahoo!|date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them [[Yoko Ono]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Peter Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbc-worldnews.net/2012/08/peter-gabriel-joins-madonna-paul-mccartney-in-backing-pussy-riot/ |publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819214737/http://bbc-worldnews.net/2012/08/peter-gabriel-joins-madonna-paul-mccartney-in-backing-pussy-riot/|title=Peter Gabriel joins Madonna, Paul McCartney in backing Pussy Riot|date=August 1, 2012|accessdate=December 22, 2013|archivedate=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pussy Riot]] themselves tweeted: "DEAR MADONNA!

Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of [[gay rights]] and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website:

{{Quote|I'm a freedom fighter. My show. My songs. My work. My art, is all about freedom of expression. Freedom to choose to speak to act. Always with humanity and compassion.

Even if one disagrees with the location or how they chose to express themselves, the sentence is too harsh and in fact is inhumane.

Following her tour in Europe, Madonna returned to the United States to perform.  Madonna urged her U.S. fans to appreciate their freedom of speech and claimed, "I've seen some scary things. I've seen people being locked up and put in jail for speaking their minds, for being gay, for not practicing the right religion, for not dressing the proper way. Yeah, it's scary. But what it made me realize is how lucky I am to be living here in America. It doesn't mean that this is the perfect country. We have a long way to go." &lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

==LGBT rights==
[[File:MDNAMasterpiece.jpg|thumb|Madonna's performance of "[[Masterpiece (Madonna song)|Masterpiece]]" was normally preceded by a speech.]]Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madonna.com/news/title/support-the-gay-lesbian-community-at-madonnas-st-petersburg-show |title=&gt; News &gt; Support the LGBT Community At Madonna's St. Petersburg Show |publisher=Madonna.com |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped in the middle of the show to speak on the issues at hand: "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." She continued, noting [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their "love and support of the gay community." She concluded, "for people quoting the [[Bible]], and using [[God]] as a defense mechanism: [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Buddha]], and [[Moses]] preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edward |first=Brett |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2012/08/10/madonna-transforms-st-petersburg-concert-unofficial-gay-pride |title=Madonna Transforms St Petersburg Concert into Unofficial Gay Pride Rally |work=The Advocate |date=August 10, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though her speech was met with much praise from the media, on August 17, it was announced that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting "homosexual propaganda" which was against the law, and allegedly "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" at the concert.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/madonna-sued-gay-rights-russia?newsfeed=true |title=Madonna sued over gay rights stance by Russian campaigners |work=The Guardian |date=August 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it.

'''"Criminalization of politics"''' is a political [[buzzword]] in the [[United States]] used in the media, by commentators, bloggers as well as by defenders of high-ranking government officials who have been indicted or have faced criminal or ethical investigations.

Most recently, the term has been applied to proceedings against [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s advisers and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leadership in [[United States Congress|Congress]], including [[Tom DeLay]], [[Bill Frist]], and [[Karl Rove]] (see [[Plame affair]]). The position of their defenders, who include [[Robert Novak]], [[William Kristol]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]], is that the accusations against these officials lack substance and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] partisans seek to weaken them for political reasons, perhaps to the point of retaking Congress in 2006.

The position of many Democrats is that the cause of the plethora of investigations is the "[[2006 Republican party scandals|culture of corruption]]" established by the Republicans in power, and that anyone who has broken laws or rules must face the consequences. The opponents also point out that some of the politicians denouncing the current pursuit of alleged Republican misconduct have in the past called for vigorous pursuit of alleged Democratic misconduct.

The phrase was previously used by supporters of President [[Bill Clinton]] in reference to legal action against members of his administration, including [[Henry Cisneros]]. During the [[Watergate scandal]], supporters of [[Richard Nixon]] claimed that he was guilty of nothing more than "hard-ball politics."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">The '''delegate model of representation''' is a model of a [[representative democracy]]. In this model, [[Electoral district|constituents]] elect their representatives as [[delegates]] for their [[constituency]]. These delegates act only as a mouthpiece for the wishes of their constituency/ state, and have no [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] from the constituency only the autonomy to vote for the actual representatives of the state. This model does not provide representatives the luxury of acting in their own conscience. Essentially, the representative acts as the voice of those who are (literally) not present.

This model was contested by [[Edmund Burke]] (1729-1797), an Irish philosopher, who also created the [[trustee model of representation]].

}}
The '''Free State Project''' ('''FSP''') is a proposed [[political migration]] founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] to move to a single low-population state ([[New Hampshire]], selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all|first=Pam|last=Belluck|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2003|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of [[limited government]] activism which they believe was caused by the small number and diffuse population of libertarian activists across the 50 United States and around the world.

Participants sign a statement of intent declaring that they intend to move to New Hampshire within five years of the drive reaching 20,000 participants. This statement of intent is intended to function as a form of [[assurance contract]]. {{As of|2016|2|3|df=US}}, 20,000 people have signed this statement of intent&lt;ref name=membership&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State Project Triggers the Move|url=https://www.fsp.org/free-state-project-triggers-the-move-libertarians-new-hampshire/|publisher=Free State Project|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—completing the original goal—and 1,909 people are listed as "early movers" to New Hampshire on the FSP website, saying they had made their move prior to the 20,000-participant trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2296999/|title=Free State Project: What happens if 20,000 libertarians move to New Hampshire?|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a dozen Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in the 2012 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jake|last=Berry|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/994856-469/movement-starts-slowly-but-future-encouraging.html|title=Free State project says future is encouraging|work=Nashua Telegraph|date=February 24, 2013|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 18 in the 2014 election.

The FSP is a social movement generally based upon [[decentralized decision making]]. The group hosts various events, but most of FSP's activities depend upon volunteers, and no formal plan dictates to participants or movers what their actions should be in New Hampshire.

==Intent==
The FSP mission statement, adopted in 2005, states: {{Cquote|The Free State Project is an agreement among 20,000 pro-liberty activists to move to New Hampshire, where they will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property. The success of the Project would likely entail reductions in taxation and regulation, reforms at all levels of government to expand individual rights and free markets, and a restoration of constitutional federalism, demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freestateproject.org/about/mission.php Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118215151/http://freestateproject.org/about/mission.php |date=January 18, 2013 }} from the Free State Project website&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Life, liberty, and property" are rights that were enumerated in the October 1774 [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress | url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp | date= October 14, 1774 | work= [[Avalon Project]] | publisher= [[Yale Law School]] | accessdate=November 11, 2010| quote=That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North-America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS:  Resolved, N.C.D. 1.

To become a participant of the Free State Project, a person is asked to agree to the Statement of Intent (SOI): {{Cquote|I hereby state my solemn intent to move to the State of New Hampshire within 5 years after 20,000 Participants have signed up. Once there, I will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of civil government is the protection of individuals' life, liberty, and property.}}

==Eligibility==
The FSP is open to people with a minimum age of 18 and United States citizenship is not required; people who promote violence, racial hatred, or bigotry are not welcome in the FSP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fsp.org/disclaimer-policies/ FSP Disclaimer and Policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The Free State Project was founded in 2001 by [[Jason Sorens]], then a Ph.D. student at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Clow |url=http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html |title=The Free State turns two |publisher=The Wire |date=October 5, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050136/http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html |archivedate=October 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorens published an article in ''[[The Libertarian Enterprise]]'' highlighting the failure of libertarians to elect any candidate to federal office and outlining his ideas for a [[secession]]ist movement, calling people to respond to him with interest.&lt;ref name="tlesoren"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe131-20010723-03.html | title=Announcement: The Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=131 | date=July 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorens soon published a follow-up article &lt;ref name="sorensfollowup"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html | title=Update: Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=132| date=August 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; backing away from secession, "and it never played a role in the FSP’s philosophy from then on.&lt;ref name="fsphistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Early Years of the Free State Project|url=https://www.fsp.org/history/|publisher=Free State Project|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Sorens has stated that the movement continues an American tradition of [[political migration]], which includes groups such as [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Utah]], [[Amish]] religious communities&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web| author=Joanna Walters | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/01/usa.joannawalters | title=Free staters pick New Hampshire to liberate for sex, guns and drugs | work= [[The Guardian]] | date=October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Jamestown Seventy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=yrlsa |first1=James F. |last1=Blumstein |first2=James |last2=Phelan |title=Jamestown Seventy |date=1971 |journal=[[Yale Review of Law and Social Action]] |volume=1 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier effort to influence the politics of a particular state through deliberate migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Libertarian Enterprise |volume=132 |date=August 6, 2001 |title=Update: Free State Project |last=Sorens |first=Jason |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FSP Gadsden Flag.gif|thumb|left|The flag of the Free State Project, a modified [[Gadsden flag]]]]
The organization began without a specific state in mind. A systematic review started by narrowing potential states to those with a population of less than 1.5 million and those where the combined spending in 2000 by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties was less than $5.2 million, the total national spending by the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] in that year. [[Hawaii]] and [[Rhode Island]] were eliminated from this list because of their propensity for centralized government.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Spear, [http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/opsa/OPSR/Journal%20Vol5-Number1/4-Student%20Contri%20butions.pdf "An Experiment in Civic Engagement: The Free State Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044314/http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/opsa/OPSR/Journal%20Vol5-Number1/4-Student%20Contri%20butions.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}, ''Oklahoma Policy Studies Review'', Vol. 5, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State selection===
In September 2003, the state vote was held and participants voted using the [[Condorcet method]] to choose the state.&lt;ref name="upandcoming"&gt;Pete Camp, [http://old.freestateproject.org/archives/state_vote/FSP-ECL-CertifyWhitePaper.htm "Free State Project Picks New Hampshire"], ''Up &amp; Coming Magazine'', October 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; New Hampshire was the winner, with Wyoming coming in second by a 57% to 43% margin.&lt;ref name="upandcoming" /&gt; Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont were also on the list.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

New Hampshire was chosen because the perceived individualist culture of the state was thought to resonate well with libertarian ideals.&lt;ref name="boston"/&gt; However, the Free State Project has drawn criticism from some New Hampshire residents concerned about population pressure and opposition to increased taxation. On the other hand, some Republicans have responded more favorably to the project because they also favor a small government.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Goldstein, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/10/09/free_state_project_pushes_limits_of_liberty_in_nh/ "Free State Project pushes limits of liberty in N.H."], ''Boston Globe'', October 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In December 2012, state representative [[Cynthia Chase]] (D-Keene) said "Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today. There is, legally, nothing we can do to prevent them from moving here to take over the state, which is their openly stated goal. In this country you can move anywhere you choose and they have that same right. What we can do is to make the environment here so unwelcoming that some will choose not to come, and some may actually leave. One way is to pass measures that will restrict the “freedoms” that they think they will find here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/27/new-hampshire-democrat-free-staters-are|title=New Hampshire Democrat: 'Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today'|work=Reason.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Concord Police Department applied for $258,000 in federal government funding to buy a [[Lenco BearCat]] armored vehicle for protection against terrorist attacks, riots, or shooting incidents. The application said: "Groups such as the Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire are active and present daily challenges". The grant from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was successful and the Concord City Council unanimously approved of the grant after having revised the application to remove references to those political movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickham|first=Shawne K.|title=Civil Liberties Union questions increasing use of costly military-style equipment by NH law enforcement|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130728/NEWS07/130729284|newspaper=Union Leader|date=July 27, 2013|location=Manchester, New Hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Republican Party Senate nominee [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]], a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], said his election campaign needed "Freestaters" to support him in his one-minute closing statement at the Granite State Debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMtg48fQocE|title=Granite State Debate, U.S. Senate: Candidates deliver closing statements|date=September 4, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move triggered===
On February 3, 2016, the Free State Project announced via social media that 20,000 people had signed the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State Project|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=February 2, 2016|url=https://twitter.com/FreeStateNH/status/694763068010713088?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference later that day, then FSP president [[Carla Gericke]] officially announced that the move had been triggered and that signers were expected to follow up on their pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freestateproject.org/blogs/free-state-project-officially-announces-20000-signers-100-reached|website=Freestateproject.org|date=2016|title=Official press conference announcing success in reaching 20,000 members}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project organization will change focus from recruiting signers to encouraging them to move to New Hampshire, stating "we want 20,000 movers".

==Political positions==
The Free State Project aligns itself with no political party, takes no official political positions, supports no candidates in elections and neither supports nor opposes any particular legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/intro Introduction to the Free State Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601025020/http://freestateproject.org/intro |date=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free State Project receives its funding from individual donors interested in moving as part of the FSP or attending one of the annual events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf Total income donations, FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816065430/http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2009-090331.pdf Total income donations FSPFY2009Actuals.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816065452/http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2009-090331.pdf |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations are tax deductible as the FSP is a tax-exempt nonprofit educational organization, falling under category 501(c)(3). This affects all donations since July 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://madmimi.com/s/bc2215 FSP Newsletter], July 2014, From the President's Desk&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early movers have been elected to the New Hampshire legislature. In 2006, one of its participants, [[Joel Winters]], was elected to the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]], running as a [[New Hampshire Democratic Party|Democrat]].&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web| subscription=yes|author= Sarah Schweitzer | title=Free State Project cheers on one of its own in Winters | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/26/free_state_project_cheers_one_of_its_own_in_winters/ | publisher=The Boston Globe | date=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in 2008, but defeated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.nh.gov/electwinwin.html List of Nov. 2010 winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205082004/http://www.sos.nh.gov/electwinwin.html |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 12 Republican Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="nationaljournal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/for-some-ron-paul-backers-a-new-motto-go-east-young-man-and-woman--20110510 | title=For Some Ron Paul Backers, a New Motto: Go East, Young Man (and Woman) | publisher=NationalJournal.com | date=May 10, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ArZQc604?url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/for-some-ron-paul-backers-a-new-motto-go-east-young-man-and-woman--20110510 | archivedate=September 22, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2012, Free Stater and self-described anarchist [[Tim O'Flaherty]] was elected to the state House of Representatives under the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] ticket, representing Manchester Ward 5.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20121115/LOCALVOICES08/121119494 |date=November 14, 2012 |title=Anarchy in Ward 5? Well, not exactly |first=Mark |last=Hayward |publisher=Manchester Union Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was defeated for re-election in 2014.

In 2012, elected participants wrote and passed House Bill 418 which requires state agencies to consider [[Open-source software|open source]] software and data formats when making acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2654797&amp;cid=38931563|title=New Hampshire Passes 'Open Source Bill' - Slashdot|work=slashdot.org|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it died in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB418/2011 New Hampshire House Bill 418]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual events==
The Free State Project is the official organizer of two annual events in New Hampshire:
* The [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]] is a convention-style event with a wide variety of speakers, dinners and events.
* The Porcupine Freedom Festival (PorcFest)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://porcfest.com|title=PorcFest|work=PorcFest|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsp.org/tag/porcupine-freedom-festival/|title=Porcupine Freedom Festival Blog Entries|work=fsp.org|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a weeklong summer festival that takes place at a campground and it is "like [[Woodstock]] for rational people", says [[Roderick Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaeblog.com/2011/06/22/way-long-gone-part-2/|title=Way Long Gone, Part 2|work=aaeblog.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaeblog.com/2011/07/09/way-long-gone-part-3/|title=Way Long Gone, Part 3|work=aaeblog.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Robert P.|title=PorcFest 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5430/PorcFest-2011|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
On February 17, 2006, economist [[Walter Block]] publicly expressed his support for the FSP and is quoted as saying:
{{Cquote|You people are doing the Lord's work. The FSP is one of the freshest practical ideas for promoting liberty that has come out of the libertarian movement in the past few decades. May you succeed beyond your wildest dreams, and thus demonstrate in yet another empirical way the benefits and blessings of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/about/endorsements#block Walter Block's endorsement of the Free State Project]. ''FreeStateProject.org.'' 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jeffrey Tucker]] reflected about his experiences at the [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]] in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], saying in part: "If you are willing to look past mainstream media coverage of American politics, you can actually find exciting and interesting activities taking place that rise above lobbying, voting, graft and corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Migration in Our Time |url=http://freestateproject.org/content/political-migration-our-time |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310194902/http://freestateproject.org/content/political-migration-our-time |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been endorsed by [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ron Paul Supports the Free State Project |url=http://freestateproject.org/intro/ron_paul |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519122424/http://freestateproject.org/intro/ron_paul |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Johnson Endorses the FSP|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLw12pbIU4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Lew Rockwell]] from the [[Mises Institute]] endorsed the project and referred to the city of [[Keene, New Hampshire]] as "The northern capital of libertarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lew Rockwell Applauds the Free State Project|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6zzipKNVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Peter Schiff]] said he had considered moving at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Schiff (Euro Pacific Capital Inc.)  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6BmdaZK3Zg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the sailing did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=JTA |date=1 July 2011 |title=Flotilla delayed until next week |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/flotilla_delayed_until_next_week_20110701/ |work=Jewish Journal |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flotilla was organized by a coalition of 22 NGOs.  Its name refers to the May 2010 [[Gaza Flotilla Raid|Gaza Freedom Flotilla]]. Their stated goal was to end the blockade of Gaza "completely and permanently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=18 June 2011 |url=http://www.freedomflotilla.eu/en/information/3-freedomflotilla-announcements/129-press-release-from-istanbul |title=Press Release from Istanbul |publisher=Freedomflotilla.eu |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625001123/http://freedomflotilla.eu/en/information/3-freedomflotilla-announcements/129-press-release-from-istanbul |archivedate=25 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, 10 ships, with 1,000 activists&lt;ref name="AJN_24Jun2011a"/&gt; were set to sail for Gaza, but by 28 June 2011, the [[List of participants of Freedom Flotilla II|number of expected participants]] had decreased to fewer than 300, plus a few dozen journalists, and by 7 July all but a few dozen activists had returned home.&lt;ref name="Katz-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magnezi-28-June-2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=28 June 2011 |title=Fewer than 300 join flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088464,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flotilla was publicly opposed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, the [[Middle East Quartet]] (consisting of the [[European Union]], Russia, the United Nations, and the United States), and [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]]. It was publicly supported by [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2011 |title=Gaza-bound activists vow to complete trek |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/07/03/gaza-flotilla.html |work=CBC World News |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists on two ships, one in Greece and one in Turkey, found similar damage to their propeller shafts, and claimed that the ships had been sabotaged by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-also-sabotaged-irish-ship-say-gaza-flotilla-organizers-1.370434
|title=Israel also sabotaged Irish ship, say Gaza flotilla organizers
|work=Haaretz |location=Israel|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the investigation by Turkish authorities on one of the ships determined that there may have been no sabotage at all, and that any damage happened before the boat arrived in Turkey, but these media reports appeared prior to the formal investigation beginning and the Turkish coastguard enquiry has yet to announce its findings. The media reports were disputed by Irish Ship to Gaza, the owner of the vessel.&lt;ref name="apgreece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greece_blocks_boat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 July 2011 |title=Sabotage of MV Saoirse |url=http://irishshiptogaza.org/?p=746 |work=Blog archive |publisher=Irish Ship to Gaza |accessdate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707062019/http://irishshiptogaza.org/?p=746 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greece forbade the vessels from leaving its ports, citing safety concerns,&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt; but offered to instead send any humanitarian aid to Gaza in its own vessels, under United Nations supervision. Greece's offer was supported by Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and the United Nations, but rejected by the flotilla activists.&lt;ref name="voareject"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt; Subsequently, two flotilla ships, the ''Audacity of Hope'' and ''Tahrir'', disobeyed Greece's orders.  They were intercepted by the Greek coast guard, brought back to shore, and a few activists were arrested. Activists responded by occupying the Spanish embassy in Athens.&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;

Only the French ship ''Dignité Al Karama'' managed to approach Gaza. They advised the Greek authorities that their destination was the Egyptian port of [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alethonews.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/dignite-al-karama-sailing-to-gaza/ |title=Dignité-Al Karama sailing to Gaza |work=Aletho News |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then turned toward Gaza.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera-2011-07-18"/&gt; On 19 July, the ship was intercepted and boarded without incident by Israeli commandos and escorted to the Israeli port of [[Ashdod]].&lt;ref name="BBC-2011-07-19"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Gazaseablocade.png|thumb|250px|Gaza Strip naval blockade area, as published by Israel's Ministry of Transport]]
After the 2007, [[Fatah-Hamas conflict]], Israel and Egypt closed off their respective borders with Gaza, preventing most goods and nearly all people from going in and out.&lt;ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/&gt;

At the end of May 2010 a flotilla of six ships left from Turkey towards the Gaza Strip. The main purpose of the flotilla, according to its organizers, was to bring humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip. On 31 May 2010 the [[Gaza flotilla raid|Israeli navy raided the ships]] some 40 kilometres away from Gaza shores. During the takeover, a violent confrontation occurred in which nine activists were killed on one of the ships and several Israeli soldiers were injured as well as dozens of passengers from several ships. At the end of the operation the ships were seized by the Israeli navy and taken to the port of Ashdod.

Following the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, international outrage contributed to a shift in Israeli policy. Both Israel and Egypt eased their blockade, letting in more goods over land.&lt;ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/&gt; In June 2010 Egypt decided to open the land crossings between Egypt and the Gaza Strip in order to transfer a minimal amount of supplies.

After the events of the 2011 flotilla raid, organizations from several countries declared their intention to send more ships to break the blockade on Gaza. As a result, the Israeli government announced that the any ships attempting to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip would be arrested.

Opinions on the [[Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid#Legality of blockade|legality]] of Israel's blockade of the Gaza strip, as well as on the use of force in international waters to maintain the blockade, are divided.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lynch |first=Colum |date=1 June 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html?hpid=topnews |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hirsch |first=Afua |date=1 June 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |work=The Guardian  |location=London |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2011, the Greek government offered to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza themselves, but Greece's offer was turned down by the activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Yaakov |date=4 July 2011 |title=Activists reject Greek offer to send flotilla aid |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=227783 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Name===
The flotilla was named in memory of [[Vittorio Arrigoni]], an Italian reporter and activist whose killing by suspected members of a Palestinian [[Salafist jihadism|Salafist]] group in Gaza in April 2011 "left the Palestinian activist community stunned." His favourite expression was "Stay Human".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schwartz |first=Susan |date=2 June 2011 |title=The Stay Human Flotilla to Gaza |url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=8577 |location=Farmington, MI |work=Muslim Observer |accessdate=26 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002214756/http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=8577 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ships===
Originally it was thought that the [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']] would lead the flotilla, but in mid-June, IHH announced that the ship would be unable to sail due to technical issues.&lt;ref name="NYT_17June2011a"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arsu |first=Sebnem |date=17 June 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/europe/18briefs-Turkey.html |title=Turkey: Aid Ship Won't Join Flotilla |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 10 July 2011, the following ships had planned on sailing to reach Gaza:&lt;ref name="Hass-2011"/&gt;

==Events==

===Preparations===
The IHH announced plans for the new flotilla, again led by the MV ''Mavi Marmara'' to depart for Gaza in June 2011.

Plans for the new flotilla were met with international opposition.

Several Dutch journalists who were due to travel in the flotilla backed out in late June, accusing the organizers of non-transparency, particularly with regard to their relations with [[Hamas]], restrictiveness, dishonesty and "shocking" gullibility. Journalist Eric Beauchemin said, "never have I seen a more closed organization. When we would ask critical questions they would accuse us of being unprofessional.

In France, a ship purchased for the flotilla was prevented from sailing after being denied permission to dock in [[Marseille]]. The move followed intense political pressure by the Jewish community on members of [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], political parties, and organizations, which in turn pressured insurance companies and authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Medzini |first=Ronen |date=15 June 2011 |title=French flotilla ship won't sail |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082772,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day before, the IHH had announced that was rethinking its participation in the flotilla and might withdraw from the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=15 June 2011 |title=IHH may not take part in flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082482,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June, İHH announced that they are still part of the flotilla movement, though the ''Mavi Marmara'' pulled out from the flotilla because, according to Yıldırım, president of IHH, "after the damage caused to the ''Mavi Marmara'' [last year], we are not in a position to go to sea".&lt;ref name="ihhff2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom Flotilla II to go ahead as planned |url=http://www.ihh.org.tr/ii-ozgurluk-filosu-yoluna-devam-ediyor/en/ |location=Istanbul |publisher=IHH |accessdate=26 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627181353/http://www.ihh.org.tr/ii-ozgurluk-filosu-yoluna-devam-ediyor/en/ |archivedate=27 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite news|last=Buck|first=Tobias|title=Turkish flagship pulls out of Gaza flotilla|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec4ab2dc-98eb-11e0-bd66-00144feab49a.html#axzz1RE42WnpH|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial leg===
Two of the vessels taking part in the flotilla set sail from the French island of [[Corsica]] to Greece, to meet up with the other vessels. The vessels docked in [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ya'ar |first=Chana |date=26 June 2011 |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/145187 |title=Flotilla Vessels Sail from France |work=Arutz Sheva |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the French vessel ''Dignité&amp;nbsp;– Al Karama'' did not dock, and proceeded directly towards the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=29 June 2011 |title=Gaza-bound flotilla underway |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088843,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vessels damaged===
On 27 June 2011, activists announced that they had discovered damage to two of the vessels, the ''Juliano'' and MV ''Saoirse''. Both the vessels had their propellers and pipes leading to their engines damaged. According to Flotilla spokesman [[Dror Feiler]], there was no direct evidence Israel was involved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keinon |first1=Kerb |last2=Katz |first2=Yaakov |date=30 June 2011 |title='Damaged Irish ship won't join flotilla after sabotage' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=227274 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he estimated the damage would take several days to repair. Other flotilla organizers suspected that the damage was the result of a sabotage operation by Israeli naval divers, and demanded that the Greek police and port authorities provide security for the vessels. Some activists announced that they themselves planned to guard the vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |date=29 June 2011 |title=Gaza flotilla organizers demand Greek police provide security for ships |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gaza-flotilla-organizers-demand-greek-police-provide-security-for-ships-1.370132 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=28 June 2011 |title=Organizers: Israeli divers harmed flotilla ship |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088583,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June, the MV ''Saoirse'' sustained damage while docked in Turkey. Activists claimed that the damage was caused by Israeli divers, who were able to avoid detection by guards stationed on the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=30 June 2011 |title=Activists: Israel sabotaged Irish vessel too |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089151,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of passengers on the flotilla said they had been mugged on the streets near the port and had mobile phones stolen, and that suspicious "fishermen" had been sighted near the ships, loitering without bait or buckets, by waters that are known to be contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Haaretz |last2=Hass |first2=Amira |date=30 June 2011 |title=Israel also sabotaged Irish ship, say Gaza flotilla organizers |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-also-sabotaged-irish-ship-say-gaza-flotilla-organizers-1.370434 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel flatly rejected the accusations as "paranoid" and accused the activists of "living in a [[James Bond]] film."&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;

Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, said that an investigation by Turkish authorities determined that there was no act of sabotage on the Irish ship, which had been docked in the Turkish port of Gocek.&lt;ref name="apgreece"/&gt; These claims have been disputed by Activists who called for an independent investigation into how the MV ''Saoirse'' was damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/irish-group-doubts-independence-of-aid-ship-sabotage-probe-511344.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the damage, the MV ''Saoirse's'' plans to join the flotilla were cancelled but several Irish activists went to Corfu to join the Italian/Dutch ship, the MV ''Stefano Chiarini''.

The Irish Ship to Gaza campaign later repaired the MV ''Saoirse'' and in November 2011, joined by the Canadian ship, the MV ''Tahrir'', it slipped out of Turkey and sailed for Gaza. This sailing was called the "Freedom Waves to Gaza" flotilla. Both ships were intercepted by Israeli warships some 50 miles from Gaza. Both ships and 27 activists and crew&amp;nbsp;– 14 Irish citizens and 13 Canadian, Australian, US and Greek citizens&amp;nbsp;– were brought by force to Ashdod, imprisoned for a week and then expelled from Israel.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Greek travel ban===
Greece announced that any vessels bound for Gaza are forbidden from leaving their ports.&lt;ref name="csm-greece"/&gt; Greece emphasized safety concerns and noted that the Secretary General of the United Nations, the European Council, the Middle East Quartet and Greece itself had already urged against participation in the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/AuthoritiesAbroad/North+America/USA/EmbassyWashington/Articles/en-US/Foreign+Ministry+Announcement+regarding+Greece%E2%80%99s+intention+to+undertake+the+task+of+transporting+hum.htm |title=Foreign Ministry Announcement regarding Greece's intention to undertake the task of transporting humanitarian aid |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Embassy Of Greece |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece offered to transfer the cargo onto Greek ships, and transport humanitarian aid through established aid channels, as requested by the UN Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ben-David |first1=Calev |last2=Petrakis |first2=Maria |date=3 July 2011 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-03/greece-offers-to-transfer-aid-from-detained-flotilla-to-gaza.html |title=Greece Offers to Transfer Aid From Detained Flotilla to Gaza |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was supported by Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations, but rejected by the flotilla activists.&lt;ref name="voareject"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt;

====Violations====
On 1 July, the American-manned flotilla boat ''Audacity of Hope'', which was not carrying any aid, sailed from [[Perama]] in violation of this Greek ban. It was intercepted after about ten minutes by an armed [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] boat and two Zodiac speedboats. An hours-long standoff ensued, with the coast guard initially trying to persuade the boat to turn back. Eventually, the boat was boarded by armed coast guard personnel and escorted to a Greek naval facility.&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Torchia |first=Christopher |date=2 July 2011 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/07/02/greeks_turn_back_us_protesters_bound_for_blockaded_gaza/ |title=Greeks turn back US protesters bound for blockaded Gaza |work=The Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek authorities arrested the American captain of the boat, John Klusmire, and held him on charges of endangering the lives of the boat's passengers, which is a felony, and of trying to leave port without permission. Activists responded by launching a [[hunger strike]]. Klusmire was released from custody on 5 July, but the charges against him were not dropped.&lt;ref name="apgreece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haspanish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apreleases"/&gt; "Only a fool thought we'd get to Gaza given what happened last year.

On 4 July, the mainly Canadian-manned ''Tahrir'' sailed from [[Crete]] in violation of the ban. It did so without its original Greek crew on board, and instead with "international volunteers" piloting the boat. Canadian Soha Kneen and Australian Michael Coleman were arrested after they used [[kayak]]s to surround a Greek coast guard vessel pursuing the boat. The coast guard vessel caught up to the ''Tahrir'' after about 15 minutes. Passengers attempted to protect the wheelhouse by draping it with netting and blocking doorways by sitting in front of them and linking arms. The ''Tahrir'' was sprayed with water cannons, boarded by armed officers, and towed back to port. One activist claimed that two officers boarded the boat, and one had a pistol drawn as he approached the boat's wheelhouse to take control. Canadian citizen Sandra Ruch, who was responsible for the boat, was arrested on charges of illegally sailing without permission. Fifty other passengers were detained by the Greek coastal authority.&lt;ref name="greece_blocks_boat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt; Activists claimed that the coast guard vessel rammed the boat against a cement pier and demanded that it be fixed immediately at Greece's expense.&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apreleases"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chai |first=Carmen |date=5 July 2011 |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Canadians+freed+after+flotilla+attempts+leave+Greece+Gaza/5052446/story.html |title=Canadians freed after flotilla attempts to leave Greece for Gaza |work=Vancouver Sun  |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists Soha Kneen and Michael Coleman were tried and found guilty of obstructing the interception of the ''Tahrir'', and were sentenced to 30 days in prison.

In the early morning of 5 July, the French yacht ''Dignité&amp;nbsp;– Al Karama'', carrying eight passengers, evaded the Greek coast guard and left a port near Athens, but turned back on its own after several hours. Reportedly, the activists aboard the vessel did not want to be the only ones sailing to the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haspanish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt; Later, the vessel attempted to depart again in defiance of the Greek ban, but was stopped and taken to the port of [[Sitia]] on the island of [[Crete]]. Greek authorities said that during these events the yacht collided with a Greek coast guard vessel and damaged it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=jpost.com staff |date=17 July 2011 |title='Gaza-bound flotilla yacht leaves Greece, sails to Egypt' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=229670 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July, about 20 Spanish activists from the ship ''Guernica'' occupied the Spanish embassy in Athens to protest the Greek travel ban.&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt;

===Activist withdrawal===
On 7 July 2011 most of the activists withdrew from the initiative and left Greece for home. Only a few dozen remained to try to convince the Greek government to end its travel ban.&lt;ref name="Katz-2010"/&gt;

===Journey of the ''Dignité Al Karama''===
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Free Gaza Flotilla Participant Accepts Food From IDF Soldier.jpg|thumb|250px|IDF soldiers giving food to ''Dignite Al Karama'' passengers following the takeover]]
On 16 July, the French yacht ''Dignité Al Karama'' left the Greek island of [[Kastellorizo]] after informing Greek authorities that its destination was the Egyptian port of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="egypt"/&gt; Instead, the vessel headed for Gaza. Aboard the yacht were 16 people, including three crew members and journalists from [[Al Jazeera]], as well as [[Amira Hass]], an Israeli journalist from ''[[Haaretz]]''.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera-2011-07-18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 July 2011 |title=Freedom Flotilla Update: Dignité-Al Karama will be arriving in Gaza any minute now |url=http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10466&amp;Itemid=56 |work=Palestine News Network |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dignité Al Karama'' was stopped by the [[Israeli Navy]] about 65 kilometers off the coast of Gaza, in international waters, after ignoring warnings that it was approaching the Gaza blockade line and must change course for either [[Ashdod]] or Egypt. The yacht was surrounded by at least three Israeli warships and boarded by [[Shayetet 13]] naval commandos, who took over the vessel, arrested the passengers, and transferred them to a warship. The operation was conducted without any resistance from the passengers or use of violence by the commandos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chai  |first=Carmen |date=19 July 2011 |title=Canadian among activists intercepted by Israel on Gaza-bound ship |url=http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=5125814 |work=canada.com |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amir |first=Ahmed |date=19 July 2011 |title=Israeli forces take over Gaza-bound boat; no resistance reported |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-19/world/israel.gaza.flotilla_1_free-gaza-movement-gaza-coast-gaza-bound?_s=PM:WORLD |work=CNN |accessdate=22 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829162856/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-19/world/israel.gaza.flotilla_1_free-gaza-movement-gaza-coast-gaza-bound?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=29 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was towed to [[Ashdod]] port and searched.

[[Medevac]] helicopters were also planned be at hand in case any of the injured needed to be evacuated to hospitalized in Israel, and [[Medical Corps (Israel)|Medical Corps]] personnel were to be deployed at the port of [[Ashdod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Hanan |date=30 June 2011 |title=Navy to deploy 'floating ORs' |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089605,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A top Israeli naval officer{{Who|date=July 2011}} warned that Israel would prevent the ships from breaking its [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade on Gaza]] at all costs, and that Israel would again use force if required, including boarding the ships and confronting the activists.

Yoav Mordechai added, "There is an unequivocal directive from the government to enforce the naval blockade that is recognized by international law, and we will not allow it to be broken."&lt;ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/&gt; The [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) began training personnel for future flotillas.

===Journalists===
{{Undue|section|date=July 2011}}

[[Israeli-Arab]] journalist [[Khaled Abu Toameh]], writing for the [[Gatestone Institute]], noted that "according to Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, there is no shortage of basic foods",&lt;ref name="Abu-Toameh-2011"/&gt; and that "periodic shortage of medical supplies is often attributed to the ongoing power struggle between Hamas and Fatah, whose representatives in the West Bank are sometimes accused of withholding medicine as a way of punishing the Hamas government."&lt;ref name="Abu-Toameh-2011"/&gt; Abu Toameh questioned why, given this situation, the flotilla organizers did not plan to help Syrian and Libyan refugees, whose situation was worse, or to express solidarity with Saudi Arabian women who are being [[gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia|arrested for driving]] cars.&lt;ref name="Abu-Toameh-2011"/&gt;

Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' editorialized against the flotilla, calling it a "charade".&lt;ref name="np-2011"/&gt; It concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;The real intention of the flotilla is to break the blockade and end Hamas' political isolation. There can be only one reason why anyone would consider such an outcome desirable: The absence of a blockade would allow the free passage of arms to the terror-embracing Hamas government, which has frequently demonstrated its goal of ending Israel's existence as a nation. Israel's blockade of Gaza is a direct consequence of attacks launched from within the territory. If flotilla participants really want to ease Gazans' isolation, they should encourage Hamas to acknowledge Israel's right to exist and to forswear terrorism.&lt;ref name="np-2011"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Pravda]]'' argued in favour of the flotilla, stating &lt;blockquote&gt;And so the world was forgetting Gaza. It forgot that the blockade was deemed illegal by the UN. They paid little attention to the complaints of people like Ilan Pappé, former professor of history at the [[University of Haifa]], "Israel uses genocidal policies in Gaza." The lack of UN action was left to pass blankly, whose commission investigating the massacre of Freedom Flotilla I was paralyzed (as though we do not know why).  It is because of this forgetfulness that Freedom Flotilla 2 was ready to sail. Remember the tragedy in Gaza is far from over. The people there are still suffering a totally illegal and unjust blockade that has lasted five years. Humanity cannot continue allowing a city to be slowly strangled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eça |first=Luiz |date=9 July 2011 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/09-07-2011/118438-Gaza_what_the_world_forgot-0/ |title=Gaza: what the world forgot |work=Pravda |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businessmen from the Gaza Strip interviewed by ''[[Ynet]]'' said regarding the flotilla that the main problem was not importing goods into Gaza, as there was "no shortage of stock" in the territory, but the difficulty of exporting goods. However, they stressed that they were not opposed to the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Levy |first=Elior |date=1 July 2011 |title=Gazans unimpressed by flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089709,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Alice Walker]] announced that she will join the flotilla and published a letter in support of the Flotilla.  The letter puts the flotilla in the context of the "followers of Gandhi," and the "Jewish civil rights activists" who stood side by side with blacks in America's South.  In the letter, she also rebukes Benjamin Netanyahu policies, and those in the US who back them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harman |first=Danna |date=23 June 2011 |title=Author Alice Walker to take part in Gaza flotilla, despite U.S. warning |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/author-alice-walker-to-take-part-in-gaza-flotilla-despite-u-s-warning-1.369262 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow author [[Howard Jacobson]] criticized Walker saying that her concern for setting the children of Gaza over the children of Israel does not justify the flotilla, and that she gives no convincing reason for partaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=JTA |date=24 June 2011 |title=UK writer slams Alice Walker for Gaza flotilla ride |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/24/3088287/acclaimed-novelist-criticizes-alice-walker-for-gaza-flotilla-participation |publisher=JTA |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627074207/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/24/3088287/acclaimed-novelist-criticizes-alice-walker-for-gaza-flotilla-participation |archivedate=27 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Missfelder, foreign policy spokesman of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) parties, the largest combined group of MPs in the [[German parliament]], said on 5 July that the so-called Gaza flotilla activists "endanger peace efforts" and their action is "part of the asymmetrical warfare against Israel." He added that their actions were "not about humanitarian help, rather a confrontation with Israel". He further stated that the activists were working against the goals of Germany and the Middle East Quartet. "I welcome that the Greek authorities have decisively intervened as some activists set sail without permission," he said.&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt;

[[Harvard University]] literature professor [[Ruth Wisse]] condemned the flotilla as a "kill-the-Jews flotilla", stating that its purpose was "to discredit the Israeli attempt to protect itself and to give Hamas a free hand amassing weapons to use against Israeli civilians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Twersky |first=Mordechai I. |date=4 July 2011 |title=Harvard professor assails 'kill-the-Jews flotilla' |url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=227881 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] condemned the flotilla for its cooperation with Hamas, noting Hamas' official and programmatic adoption of the [[antisemitic]] forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', its expression of outrage at the [[death of Osama bin Laden]], and its ties with [[Hezbollah]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the regimes of Syria and Iran. He also criticized the media for "soft-centred coverage" of the affair, suggesting that pointed questions should have been asked of the flotilla participants and that the title "activists" was an inaccurate and gratuitously positive label for the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchins |first=Christopher |date=5 July 2011 |title=Christopher Hitchens: Some questions for the 'activists' aboard the Gaza flotilla |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/05/christopher-hitchens-some-questions-for-the-%E2%80%9Cactivists%E2%80%9D-aboard-the-gaza-flotilla/ |work=National Post Full Comment |location=Toronto |accessdate=10 July 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708155459/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/05/christopher-hitchens-some-questions-for-the-%E2%80%9Cactivists%E2%80%9D-aboard-the-gaza-flotilla/# |archive-date=8 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]], Member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) and longtime Freedom Flotilla supporter, "The aim of the Flotilla is to break that siege by delivering vital medical supplies and construction material and to highlight the ongoing blockade and impact on the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=24 June 2011 |url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5155 |title=Paul Murphy Socialist Party MEP  joins 'Freedom Flotilla II' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/603tZQbQo?url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5155 |work=socialistworld.net |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite web|author=World Health Organization |date=20 June 2011 |title=Shortages of drugs and medical disposables in MoH Gaza |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/B35E9E3AC0BFF630852578B5004B9C43 |work=UNISPAL Documents Collection |accessdate=5 July 2011 |quote=... the protracted period of low stocks is now deemed critical for the continued delivery of health care. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[Nobel Peace]] Laureates, [[Mairead Maguire]], [[Jody Williams]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], and [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]], wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon "to urge you to use your good offices in support of the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza....by appointing a representative to inspect and seal the cargo of the boats of the Freedom Flotilla II—thus assuring the Israeli government that the boats are carrying humanitarian supplies such as toys, medical supplies, cement and educational materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laureates to Ban Ki-moon: Safe passage for Gaza Flotilla |url=http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/home/article/laureates-support-freedom-flotilla |date=10 June 2011 &lt;!--date of the open letter--&gt; |location=Ottawa |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721201740/http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/home/article/laureates-support-freedom-flotilla |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2011, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] linguistics professor [[Noam Chomsky]], wrote "Today the U.S. and Israel are vigorously seeking to block the flotilla. U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] virtually authorized violence, stating that 'Israelis have the right to defend themselves' if flotillas 'try to provoke action by entering into Israeli waters'&amp;nbsp;– that is, the territorial waters of Gaza, as if Gaza belonged to Israel. Greece agreed to prevent the boats from leaving (that is, those boats not already sabotaged)&amp;nbsp;– though, unlike Clinton, Greece referred rightly to 'the maritime area of Gaza.' In January 2009, Greece had distinguished itself by refusing to permit U.S. arms to be shipped to Israel from Greek ports during the vicious U.S.-Israeli assault in Gaza. No longer an independent country in its current financial duress, Greece evidently cannot risk such unusual integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=7 July 2011 |title=In Israel, a Tsunami Warning |url=http://www.truth-out.org/israel-tsunami-warning/1310042953 |work=Truthout |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to Greek ban===
Greek President [[Karolos Papoulias]] later visited Israel, where Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] told him: "I thank you very much for fulfilling the UN secretary general's guidelines and stopping the flotilla. Thank you for not allowing people interested in disturbing good order and international law from coming without supervision to Gaza, which is led by a terrorist group."&lt;ref name="egypt"/&gt;

Joshua Mitnick of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that Greece's actions were the result of a growing relationship between Israel and Greece, including an offer of "generous military assistance", that started after Israeli–Turkish ties were damaged by the Gaza flotilla raid.&lt;ref name="csm-greece"/&gt;

Judge '''George Washington Olvany''' (June 20, 1876 – October 15, 1952) was a [[New York General Sessions Court]] judge, the deputy [[New York City Fire Commissioner]], and the leader of [[Tammany Hall]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Death of Brennan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881173,00.html |quote=George Washington Olvany, under the careful guidance of Governor Smith, has succeeded Tammany Boss Murphy.

'''''Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Politics''''' is a 6x60 minutes [[documentary film|documentary]] TV-series about the relationship between singers and politics in the USA, the UK, Germany and France from the 1960s until 2003. It was made in 2003 by [[Rudi Dolezal]], [[Hannes Rossacher]] and Simon Witter as a joint production between German [[ZDF]] and the French-German culture channel [[Arte]]. It has since been shown by a number of other broadcasters in Europe, but also by Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/Crying-freedom/2005/04/13/1113251640013.html|title=Crying freedom|date=2005-04-13|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features interviews with well known singers and songwriters including [[Joan Baez]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Bono]], [[David Bowie]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ice-T]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Neil Young]].

A much shorter, two-hour version, called '''''Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Protest''''', aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in September 2005, hosted and narrated by co-founder of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] [[Chuck D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/getupstandup/index.html|title=Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Protest|date=2005-09-01|work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PBS version focuses mainly on the American history of [[protest songs]].

The title is borrowed from the [[reggae]] protest song ''[[Get Up, Stand Up]]'' by [[Bob Marley]] and [[Peter Tosh]].

[[Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes’s]] moral and political [[philosophy]] is constructed around the basic premise of social and political order, explaining how humans should live in peace under a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] power so as to avoid conflict within the ‘[[state of nature]]’.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/#SH4d|title=Thomas Hobbes: Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Garrath|date=|website=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes’s [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]] are intertwined; his moral thought is based around ideas of human nature, which determine the interactions that make up his political philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes: Cases in the Law of Nature|last=Lloyd|first=Sharon A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes’s moral philosophy therefore provides justification for, and informs, the theories of [[sovereignty]] and the [[state of nature]] that underpin his political philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In utilising methods of [[deductive reasoning]] and [[wikt:motion|motion]] science, Hobbes examines human emotion, reason and knowledge to construct his ideas of human nature (moral philosophy).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Hobbes|last=Höffe|first=Otfried|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=2-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology critically influences his politics, determining the interactions of conflict (in the state of nature) which necessitate the creation of a politically authoritative [[State (polity)|state]] to ensure the maintenance of peace and cooperation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its Genesis|last=Strauss|first=Leo|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used and developed in works such as ''The Elements of Law'' (1640), ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642), ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) and ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'' (1681).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbesian Moral and Political Theory|last=Kavka|first=Gregory S.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=7-292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
In developing his moral and political philosophy, Hobbes assumes the methodological approach of deductive reasoning, combining mathematics and the [[mechanics]] of science to formulate his ideas on human nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes was critical of the assumptions of scholastic philosophers, whose evidence for human nature was based upon [[Aristotelian metaphysics]] and [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] observation, as opposed to reasoning and definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Though Hobbes did not fully reject the value of observational or ‘prudential’ knowledge, he dismissed the view that this was at all scientific or philosophical in nature.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To Hobbes, this type of knowledge was based on subjective and diverse experience, and was therefore only capable of producing speculative assumptions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This view predetermined Hobbes’s method of deductive reasoning, which involved the application of geometry, [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] scientific concepts and definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This scientific method stresses the importance of first establishing well-defined principles of human nature (moral philosophy) and ‘deducing’ aspects of political life from this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes first used the mechanics of motion to define principles of human perception, behaviour and reasoning, which were then used to draw the conclusions of his political philosophy (sovereignty, state of nature).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In rejecting what he believed were ‘conjectures’ relating to intangible or supernatural objects or realities, Hobbes’s philosophy is drawn from material and physical reality and experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Otfried Höffe|Höffe]] explains how Hobbes applied this method to construct his political theory of sovereignty:

“…the combination of mathematics and mechanics, is not sufficient on its own… the combination of mathematics and mechanics leads to the metaphor of the state as an “artificial” human being, which is comparable to a machine constructed out of natural human beings; (3) the resoluto-compositive [the recourse to absolutely first principles or elements] method defines and clarifies the nature of this construction: the artificial human being is decomposed into its smallest constituent parts and then recomposed, i.e., constructed, out of these parts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hobbes’s moral principles thus provide the ultimate basis for his political philosophy, defining and clarifying how an “artificial” sovereign authority may come into existence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Moral philosophy ==
Hobbes’s moral philosophy is the fundamental starting point from which his political philosophy is developed. This moral philosophy outlines a general conceptual framework on human nature which is rigorously developed in ''The Elements of Law'', ''De Cive'' and ''Leviathan''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These works examine how the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] influence human perception, behaviour and action, which then determine how individuals interact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Elements of Law'' provides insight into Hobbes’s moral philosophy through ideas of sensation, pleasure, passion, pain, memory and reason.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Hobbes|last=Bunce|first=Robin E. R.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC|year=2009|isbn=|location=London|pages=20-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expanded upon in ''De Cive'': “… human nature… comprising the faculties of body and mind; . . . Physical force, Experience Reason and Passion".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hobbes believes that as sensory organs process the movements of [[Stimulus (physiology)|external stimuli]], a range of different mental experiences take place, which in turn dictate human behaviour.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmeth/|title=Thomas Hobbes: Methodology|last=Finn|first=Stephen|date=|website=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What emerged from this idea of motion was the view that humans are naturally drawn towards, or desire, things that benefit their overall wellbeing; things that are “good” for them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These are called “appetites”, and what differentiates the human ‘appetite’ from that of animals is reason.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reason, or “[[ratiocination]]”, as used by Hobbes, was not defined in the traditional sense as an innate capability tied to notions of [[natural law]], but as an activity that involved coming to a judgement via the process of [[logic]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Humans, as noted in ''Leviathan'', have “…knowledge of the consequences of one affirmation to another”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Individuals will desire and select whatever ‘thing’ brings them the most “good”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This process of thinking is a consequence of motion and mechanics more than a conscious exercise of choice.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ratiocination leads individuals to uncover the [[Natural law|Laws of Nature]], which Hobbes deems “the true moral philosophy”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hobbes’s understanding of human nature establishes the foundations for his political philosophy by explaining the essence of conflict (in the state of nature) and cooperation (in a [[commonwealth]]).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because human beings will always pursue what is ‘good’ for them, this philosophy asserts that individuals share overarching desires or goals, such as security and safety (especially from death).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is the point in which Hobbes’s moral and political philosophy intersect: in “our shared conception of ourselves as [[Rationality|rational]] agents”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rational to “pursue the necessary means to our dominant shared ends”, in which case the “necessary means” is submission to a sovereign authority.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By establishing morality as a force which directs individuals towards their shared desires and goals of, for example, peace and security, and the means to achieve these goals is through the creation of a state, Hobbes grounds his political philosophy in his moral thought.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This approach to moral philosophy is executed by Hobbes through discussion of a range of interrelated moral concepts: “[[good]], [[evil]], [[rights]], [[obligation]], [[justice]], [[Social contract|contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]] and natural law”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Moral concepts ===

==== Obligation ====
Hobbes’s concept of moral obligation stems from the assumption that humans have a fundamental obligation to follow the laws of nature and all obligations stem from nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Leviathan: The Moral and Political Theory of Thomas Hobbes|last=Gauthier|first=David P.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reasoning for this is premised upon the beliefs of natural law; that the moral standards or reasoning that govern behaviour can be drawn from eternal truths regarding human nature and the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes believes that the morals derived from natural law, however, do not permit individuals to challenge the laws of the sovereign; law of the commonwealth supersedes natural law, and obeying the laws of nature does not make you exempt from disobeying those of the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hobbes’s concept of moral obligation thus intertwines with the concept of political obligation. This underpins much of Hobbes’s political philosophy, stating that humans have a political obligation or ‘[[duty]]’ to prevent the creation of a state of nature.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=hobbes-moral|title=Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Lloyd|first=Sharon A.|date=|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a political obligation to obey a sovereign power, and once they have renounced part of their [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] to this power (theory of sovereignty), they have a duty to uphold the ‘[[Social contract|social contract’]] they have entered into.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

== Political philosophy ==
[[File:Leviathan_livre.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from the first edition of ''Leviathan'' (1651) which serves as a visual representation of Hobbes's idea of the state. 

The city pictured in the foreground of the image represents civilisation, while the salient figure (Leviathan), with a sword and crosier in hand, personifies sovereignty and the omnipotent state, possessing the authority to represent the collective will of the people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ]]
The main aspects of Hobbes’s political philosophy revolve around the contrasting relationship between the state of nature (a state of war) and the State itself as one of peace and cooperation. This philosophy is determined by, and implied in, his method of deduction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The trajectory of individual desire and [[Will (philosophy)|will]] outlined in his moral philosophy is a decisive factor contributing to the formulation of his idea of the State.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hobbes outlined four key principles of purpose in his philosophical literature:

# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welfare of the general public.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;State of well-being and satisfaction with life.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pursuit of justice.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pursuit of peace (to avoid the ‘state of war’).&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These concepts are mutually reinforcing and feature across his most prominent works. For example, in ''The Elements of Law'', Hobbes claims that the benefits given to the general public under a commonwealth are “incomparable”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This overlaps with his discussion of justice in the same text, which is used in a political context.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Leviathan'' details all four principles but focuses on the pursuit of peace, which Hobbes aligns with the first principle of welfare and public good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Where a state of peace (4) and justice (3), and the overall welfare of the general public (1), manifest under a commonwealth (stemming from ‘[[Common good|commonweal]]’: the general good of the public), a state of well-being and overall satisfaction (2) may be secured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only under the commonwealth (as opposed to a state of nature and war) can peace, and “the notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice”, exist indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is expanded upon again in ''The Elements of Law'', which posits that humans by nature are inclined towards conflict, and therefore need a State to institute peace and protect individuals against the threats of [[self-preservation]] which flourish in a state of nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ''De Cive'' also builds on the relationship between these principles, where Hobbes’s claim to show individuals the “highway to peace” affirms his notion that humans should pursue peace, and therefore justice, in the form of a commonwealth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is in the interest of humans to pursue peace, who have a fundamental obligation to follow the Laws of Nature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

A sovereign power or authority figure - a Leviathan - is needed to translate these Laws of Nature in a “binding and authoritative fashion”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The notion that individuals require a “visible power to keep them in awe” - to maintain peace and safety through enforcement of law - underpins Hobbes’s theory of sovereignty, which proposes that a sovereign ruler (with authority to govern the people) is fundamental to any type of commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbes and the Law of Nature|last=Zagorin|first=Perez|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the overarching concern of Hobbes’s political philosophy remains the capacity of the government to maintain peace, protection, justice and wellbeing in a manner that ensures the continuation of society and [[Civil society|civil life]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2695">[[File:Nicolai Wergeland.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolai Wergeland]], one of the principal authors of the clause.]]

The '''Jew clause''' ({{lang-no|Jødeparagrafen}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stortinget.no%2Fno%2FStortinget-og-demokratiet%2FHistorikk%2FHistorisk-dokumentasjon%2FJodeparagrafen%2F&amp;edit-text=|title=A digital dissemination of documents to the history of the Jews Act, § 2, last passus, in the Norwegian Constitution of 17 May 1814.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the vernacular name of the second paragraph of the [[Constitution of Norway]] from 1814 to 1851. The clause, in its original form, banned [[Jews]] from entering [[Norway]], and also forbade [[Jesuits]] and monastic orders. An exception was made for so-called [[Portuguese Jews]]. The penultimate sentence of the same paragraph is known as the Jesuit clause ({{lang-no|Jesuittparagrafen}}).

The clause roughly translates as:

{{quote|The Evangelical-Lutheran religion is the state's public religion. The inhabitants who practice it are obliged to raise their children in the same. Jesuits and monastic orders may not be tolerated. Jews are excluded from access to the Kingdom.}}

[[Christian Magnus Falsen]], [[Georg Sverdrup]] and [[Nicolai Wergeland]] were the central delegates behind the wording of the section's final paragraph. The wording was adopted on May 4, 1814. This paragraph was finalized in Constitutional Committee and adopted after discussion, but without changes in the plenary.

On June 13, 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stortinget.no%2Fno%2FStortinget-og-demokratiet%2FHistorikk%2FHistorisk-dokumentasjon%2FJodeparagrafen%2F&amp;edit-text=|title=The abolition of the Jews Act in Norway's Basic Law 1814 - 1851 - 2001. Brief history and description of the documentation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; after tireless efforts by the poet [[Henrik Wergeland]] (the son of the clause's architect Nicolai Wergeland), as well as politician [[Peder Jensen Fauchald]], school principal [[Hans Holmboe]], and others, the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian parliament]] deleted the article from the constitution, and thereby lifted the ban against Jews, who were thus awarded religious rights on par with Christian dissenters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30245">{{short description|A movement of activists whose Judaism informs their support left-wing or liberal causes}}
The '''Jewish left''' consists of [[Jews]] who identify with, or support, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] causes, consciously as Jews, either as individuals or through organizations. There is no one organization or movement which constitutes the Jewish left, however. Jews have been major forces in the history of the [[labor movement]], the [[settlement house]] movement, the [[women's rights]] movement, [[anti-racist]] work, and [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] organizations of many forms in [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and modern-day [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/newleft.html "The New Left."] ''Jewish Virtual Library'' (2008); retrieved 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews have a rich history of involvement in [[Jewish anarchism|anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[Marxism]], and Western [[liberalism]]. Although the expression "on the left" covers a range of politics, many well-known figures "on the left" have been of Jews who were born into Jewish families and have various degrees of connection to Jewish communities, Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, or the Jewish religion in its many variants.

==History==
Jewish leftism has its philosophic roots in the Jewish Enlightenment, or [[Haskalah]], led by thinkers such as [[Moses Mendelssohn]], as well as the support of many European Jews such as [[Ludwig Börne]] for [[republicanism|republican]] ideals in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a movement for [[Jewish Emancipation]] spread across [[Europe]], strongly associated with the emergence of [[political liberalism]], based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of [[rights]] and [[equality under the law]]. Because liberals represented the political left of the time (see [[left-right politics]]), emancipated Jews, as they entered the political culture of the nations where they lived, became closely associated with liberal parties. Thus, many Jews supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, and the [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]]; while [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]] tended to vote for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], which had led the parliamentary struggle for [[Emancipation of the Jews in England|Jewish Emancipation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Alderman]] (1983) ''The Jewish Community in British Politics'', Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; — an arrangement called by some scholars "the liberal Jewish compromise".&lt;ref&gt;see Sharman Kadish ''Bolsheviks and British Jews'', London: Frank Cass. (1992, e. g., pp. 55-60, 132); Jonathan Hyman [http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/medialibrary/arts/history/workingpapers/wp_50.pdf ''Jews in Britain During the Great War''], Manchester: University of Manchester Working Papers in Economic and Social History No. 51, October (2001, e. g., p. 11). The phrase was coined by [[Steven Bayme]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The emergence of a Jewish working class===
In the age of [[industrialisation]] in the late nineteenth century, a Jewish [[working class]] emerged in the cities of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]. Before long, a Jewish [[labour movement]] emerged too. The Jewish Labour Bund–[[General Jewish Labor Union]] was formed in [[Lithuania]], Poland, and Russia in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, Philip. [http://jewishcurrents.org/rise-fall-jewish-labor-bund-23131 "The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Labor Bund"], ''Jewish Currents'' (Autumn 2013); accessed 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive Jewish [[socialist]] organizations formed and spread across the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. There were also a significant number of people of Jewish origin who did not explicitly identify as Jews per se, but were active in anarchist, socialist, and social democratic as well as communist organizations, movements, and parties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As [[Zionism]] grew in strength as a political movement, [[socialist Zionist]] parties were formed, such as [[Ber Borochov]]'s [[Poale Zion]]. There were non-Zionist left-wing forms of [[Jewish nationalism]], such as [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialism]] (which called for a Jewish national homeland, but not necessarily in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]), [[Jewish Autonomism|autonomism]] (which called for non-territorial national rights for Jews in multinational empires), and the [[Folkspartei|folkism]], advocated by [[Simon Dubnow]], (which celebrated the [[cultural Judaism|Jewish culture]] of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking masses).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As Eastern European Jews migrated West from the 1880s, these ideologies took root in growing Jewish communities, such as [[London]]'s [[East End]], [[Paris]]'s [[Pletzl]], [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]], and [[Buenos Aires]]. There was a lively Jewish anarchist scene in London, a central figure of which was, the non-Jewish German thinker and writer [[Rudolf Rocker]]. The important Jewish socialist movement in the United States, with its Yiddish-language daily, ''[[The Forward]]'', and trade unions such as the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]]. Important figures in these milieux included [[Rose Schneiderman]], [[Abraham Cahan]], [[Morris Winchevsky]], and [[David Dubinsky]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews played a major role in the [[Social Democratic]] parties of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Germany]], [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russia]], [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austria-Hungary]], and [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Poland]]. Historian [[Enzo Traverso]] has used the term "Judeo-Marxism" to describe the innovative forms of [[Marxism]] associated with these Jewish socialists. These ranged from strongly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] positions hostile to all forms of [[nationalism]] (as with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Leon Trotsky]]) to positions more sympathetic to cultural nationalism (as with the [[Austromarxists]] or [[Vladimir Medem]]).

===In Soviets and against fascism===
As with the American revolution of 1776, the French revolution of 1789, and the German revolution of 1848, many Jews worldwide welcomed the [[Russian revolution of 1917]], celebrating the fall of a regime that had presided over antisemitic [[pogroms]], and believing that the new order in what was to become the Soviet Union would bring improvements in the situation of Jews in those lands. Many Jews became involved in [[Communist parties]], constituting large proportions of their membership in many countries, including [[Great Britain]] and the U.S. There were specifically Jewish sections of many Communist parties, such as the [[Yevsektsiya]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Communist regime in the USSR pursued what could be characterised as ambivalent policies towards Jews and Jewish culture, at times supporting their development as a national culture (e. g., sponsoring significant Yiddish language scholarship and creating an [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast|autonomous Jewish territory]] in [[Birobidzhan]]), at times pursuing antisemitic purges, such as that in the wake of the so-called [[Doctors' plot]]. (See also [[Komzet]].)

With the advent of [[fascism]] in parts of Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, many Jews responded by becoming actively involved in the left, and particularly the Communist parties, which were at the forefront of the [[anti-fascist]] movement. For example, many Jewish volunteers fought in the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (for instance in the American [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] and in the Polish-Jewish [[Naftali Botwin Company]]). Jews and leftists fought [[Oswald Mosley]]'s British fascists at the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. This mass movement was influenced by the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] in the Soviet Union.

In [[World War II]], the Jewish left played a major part in [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to Nazism]]. For example, Bundists and left Zionists were key in [[Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Radical Jews in Central and Western Europe===
As well as the movements rooted in the Jewish working class, relatively [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[middle class]] Jews in Central and Western Europe began to search for sources of radicalism in Jewish tradition. For example, [[Martin Buber]] drew on [[Hasidism]] in articulating his anarchist philosophy, [[Gershom Scholem]] was an anarchist and a [[kabbalah]] scholar, [[Walter Benjamin]] was equally influenced by [[Marxism]] and Jewish [[messianism]], [[Gustav Landauer]] was a religious Jew and a [[libertarian communist]], [[Jacob Israël de Haan]] combined socialism with [[Haredi]] Judaism, while [[left-libertarian]] [[Bernard Lazare]] became a passionately Jewish Zionist in 1897, but wrote 2 years later to Herzl - and by extension to the [[Zionist Action Committee]] -, "You are [[bourgeois]] in thoughts, bourgeois in your feelings, bourgeois in your ideas, bourgeois in your conception of society.".&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Piterberg (2008), ''The Returns of Zionism: Myths, Politics, and Scholarship in Israel'', London: Verso, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Weimar Germany]], [[Walther Rathenau]] was a leading figure of the Jewish left.

===Socialist Zionism and the Israeli left===
{{Main|Labor Zionism}}
In the twentieth century, especially after the [[Second Aliyah]], socialist Zionism - first developed in Russia by the Marxist Ber Borochov and the non-Marxists [[Nachman Syrkin]] and [[A. D. Gordon]] - became a powerful force in the [[Yishuv]], the Jewish settlement in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Poale Zion, the [[Histadrut]] labour union and the [[Mapai]] party played a major part in the campaign for an [[Israel|Israeli state]], with socialist politicians like [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Golda Meir]] amongst the founders of the nation. At the same time, the [[kibbutz]] movement was an experiment in practical socialism.

In the 1940s, many on the left advocated a [[binational state]] in Israel/Palestine, rather than an exclusively Jewish state. (This position was taken by [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Martin Buber]], for example). Since independence in 1948, there has been a lively Israeli left, both Zionist ([[Labor Party (Israel)|the Labour Party]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]]) and [[anti-Zionist]] ([[Palestine Communist Party]], [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]]). The Labour Party and its predecessors have been in power in Israel for significant periods since 1948.

There are two worldwide groupings of left-wing Zionist organizations. The World Labour Zionist Movement, associated with the Labor Zionist tendency, is a loose association, including [[Labor Party (Israel)|Avoda]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Histadrut]] and [[Na'amat]]. The [[Meretz|World Union of Meretz]], associated with what was historically known as the Socialist Zionist tendency, is a loose association of the Israeli Meretz party, the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] Socialist Zionist youth movement, the [[Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz Artzi Federation]] and the [[Givat Haviva]] research and study center. Both movements exist as factions within the [[World Zionist Organization]], as well as regional or country-specific Zionist movements; the two roughly correspond to the interwar split between the Poale Zion Right (the tradition that led to Avoda) and the Poale Zion Left (Hashomer Hatzair, Mapam, Meretz).

===Apartheid South Africa===
South Africa's Jewish left-wing was heavily involved in left-wing causes such as the anti-apartheid movement. The most famous member of the anti-apartheid Jewish left-wing was [[Helen Suzman|Helen Suzman, DBE]]. There were also several liberal left-wing Jewish defendants in the [[Rivonia Trial]]: [[Joe Slovo]], [[Denis Goldberg]], [[Lionel Bernstein]], [[Bob Hepple]], [[Arthur Goldreich]], [[Harold Wolpe]], and [[James Kantor]].

==Contemporary Jewish left==
===1960s–1990s===
As the Jewish working class died out in the years after the [[Second World War]], its institutions and political movements did too. The [[Arbeter Ring]] in England, for example, came to an end in the 1950s and Jewish trade unionism in the US ceased to be a major force at that time. There are, however, still some remnants of the Jewish working class organizations left today, including the [[Workmen's Circle]], [[Jewish Labor Committee]], and ''[[The Forward]]'' (newspaper) in New York, the [[International Jewish Labor Bund]] in Australia, and the [[United Jewish People's Order]] in Canada.

The 1960s-1980s saw a renewal of interest among Western Jews in Jewish [[working class culture]] and the various radical traditions of the Jewish past. This led to the growth of a new sort of radical Jewish organization that was both interested in Yiddish culture, Jewish spirituality, and social justice. In the US, for example, between 1980–1992, [[New Jewish Agenda]] functioned as a national, multi-issue progressive membership organization with the mission of acting as a "Jewish voice on the Left and a Left voice in the Jewish Community". In 1991, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice formed to fight for "equitable distribution of economic and cultural resources and political power" in New York City. And in 1999, leftists broke from the LA chapter of the American Jewish Congress to form the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance]]. In Britain, the [[Jewish Socialists' Group]] and Rabbi [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]]'s [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] have similarly continued this tradition, while more recently groups like [[Jewdas]] have taken an even more eclectic and radical approach to Jewishness. In [[Belgium]], the [[Union des progressistes juifs de Belgique]] is, since 1969, the heir of the Jewish Communist and Bundist Solidarité movement in the [[Belgian Resistance]], embracing the [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|Israeli refuseniks]] cause as well as of the undocumented immigrants in Belgium.

===2000s–present===
During the first decade of the 2000s, the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] became a defining element in the composition of the diasporic Jewish left. A new wave of Jewish organizations formed to support Palestinian causes. Groups such as [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)]], [[Independent Jewish Voices|Independent Jewish Voices (UK)]] and the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]] gave renewed voice to [[Jewish Anti-Zionism]]. This perspective continues to be reflected in media outlets such as [[Mondoweiss]] and the Treyf Podcast.

Following the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], many leftist Jewish organizations in the US and Canada focused on directly challenging establishment Jewish organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/direct-action-disrupts-israeli-canadian-complicity-in-settler-colonialism|title=Direct action disrupts Jewish-Canadian complicity in settler colonialism – Canadian Dimension|website=Canadiandimension.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus|title=The rise of 'If Not Now' and the collapse of the pro-Israel consensus|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2014-09-10|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/national/339090/17-jewish-activists-protesting-israeli-occupation-arrested-at-adl-headquart/ |title=17 Jewish Activists Protesting Israeli Occupation Arrested at ADL Headquarters|website=Forward.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/louis-cancel-police|title=St. Louis Jews call on ADL to cancel honor to police|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2015-07-18|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Jewish Federations|Jewish Federation]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], and [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], for their support for Israel's actions during the conflict. In the US, this intra-community conflict expanded to domestic politics following the [[United States presidential election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jewschool.com/2016/11/78055/photos-young-jews-march-on-trump-hq-stopbannon|title=PHOTOS: Young Jews march on Trump HQ: #StopBannon: Will the Jewish Federations of North America follow suit?|website=Jewschool.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as If Not Now, [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice began organizing under the banner of #JewishResistance to "challenge institutional Jewish support for the Trump administration and affiliated white nationalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/160010/hundreds-join-jewish-resistance-protest-against-trump-chief-strategist-steve-bannon#.mNWlaFWoe|title=Hundreds join #JewishResistance protest against Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon|website=Mic.com|date=2016-11-21|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to exit polls, 71% of American Jews voted Democrat during the 2016 US Presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickland |first1=Produced By Jon Huang, Samuel Jacoby, Michael |last2=Lai |first2=K. k Rebecca |title=Election 2016: Exit Polls |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=1 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=16 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161211011026/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=1 |archivedate=11 December 2016 |date=8 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last decade, the Jewish vote has gone to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] by 76–80%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/jewvote.html|title=Jewish Voting Record in U.S. Presidential Elections|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in each election.

===Contemporary Israeli left===
Operating in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] governmental system based on [[proportional representation]], left-wing political parties and blocs in Israel have been able to elect members of the [[Knesset]] with varying degrees of success. Over time, those parties have evolved, with some merging, others disappearing, and new parties arising.

Israeli left-wing parties have included:
*[[Hadash]]
*[[Mapam]]
*[[Meretz-Yachad]]
*[[HaAvoda]]
*[[Meimad]]
*[[Progressive List for Peace]]
*[[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]]
*[[Left Camp of Israel]]
*[[HaOlam HaZeh – Koah Hadash]]

Notable figures in these parties have included: [[Meir Vilner]], [[Shulamit Aloni]], [[Uri Avnery]], [[Yossi Beilin]], [[Ran Cohen]], [[Mattityahu Peled|Matti Peled]], [[Amnon Rubinstein]], and [[Yossi Sarid]].

{{further|Politics of Israel#Political left}}

==British Jewish left==
[[British Jews]] have been influential in the left-wing [[politics of the United Kingdom]] for many years, especially in the main social democratic/socialist party, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but also in the socially liberal [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

During the years when the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was Britain's main party of the left, two Jews in particular attained high office: [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], who led the Liberal Party from 1930–1935, and [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], the only British Jew to have been created a Marquess. Other notable Liberal Jews of the 1800s and early 1900s included: [[Lionel de Rothschild]], the first Jew to serve as an MP, [[David Salomons|Sir David Salomons]], [[Francis Goldsmid|Sir Francis Goldsmid]], [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Arthur Cohen (politician)|Arthur Cohen]], [[Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling|The Lord Swaythling]], [[Sir Edward Sassoon, 2nd Baronet, of Kensington Gore|Sir Edward Sassoon]], [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|The Lord Hore-Belisha]] [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]], [[Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln]], and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|The Lord Wandsworth]].

In the early part of the 20th century, the Liberal Party gave way to the more radical and socialist Labour Party. [[Leonard Woolf]] and [[Hugh Franklin (suffragist)|Hugh Franklin]] were among the figures influential in the early Labour Party, and Jewish MPs like [[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Barnett Janner]], [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]] and [[Harry Nathan, 1st Baron Nathan|The Lord Nathan]] were among the radical Liberal MPs, many of whom switched from Liberal to Labour, economists like [[Harold Laski]] and [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and intellectuals like [[Victor Gollancz]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] provided the intellectual impetus for British socialism to take hold. Prominent early Labour MPs included [[Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin|The Lord Silkin]], who became a Minister in [[Clement Attlee]]'s government, [[Sydney Silverman]], who abolished [[capital punishment]] in Britain, and [[Manny Shinwell, Baron Shinwell|The Lord Shinwell]], one of the leaders of [[Red Clydeside]] who later became [[Secretary of State for War]].

At the end of the [[Second World War]], the Labour Party entered government again, and several newly elected Labour MPs were Jewish, and often on the socialist left of the Party, radicalised by incidents like the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. Those MPs included [[Herschel Lewis Austin]], [[Maurice Edelman]], and [[Ian Mikardo]], as well as [[Phil Piratin]], one of only four MPs in British history to have represented the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Several MPs elected in the 1940s and 1950s went on to be Ministers in [[Harold Wilson]]'s governments of the 1960s and 1970s: [[Joel Barnett, Baron Barnett|The Lord Barnett]], [[Edmund Dell]], [[John Diamond, Baron Diamond|John Diamond]], [[Reg Freeson]], [[Dora Gaitskell, Baroness Gaitskell|The Baroness Gaitskell]], [[Myer Galpern]], [[Gerald Kaufman]], [[Harold Lever, Baron Lever of Manchester|The Lord Lever of Manchester]], [[Paul Rose (UK politician)|Paul Rose]], [[Samuel Segal, Baron Segal|The Lord Segal]], [[Beatrice Serota, Baroness Serota|The Baroness Serota]], [[Robert Sheldon, Baron Sheldon|The Lord Sheldon]], [[John Silkin|John]] and [[Samuel Silkin, Baron Silkin of Dulwich|Samuel Silkin]], [[Barnett Stross]], and [[David Weitzman]]. A prominent Jewish Labour politician in this era was [[Leo Abse]], who put forward the private members' bill which decriminalised homosexuality and reformed the divorce laws in Britain. [[Robert Maxwell]], a Labour MP during the 1964–66 Wilson government, eventually became a leading newspaper publisher when his holding company purchased [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] in 1984.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party experienced significant turbulence with the rise of the [[Entryism|entryist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] (a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] group led by [[Ted Grant]]), and the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) breaking away and forming an [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] with the Liberal Party (who had two Jewish MPs, [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|The Lord Carlile of Berriew]] and [[Clement Freud]]), later to unite as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. One such parliamentary defector to the SDP was [[Neville Sandelson]], and the [[Keynesian]] economist [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|The Lord Skidelsky]] also defected. Those Jewish Labour MPs who stuck with the party included [[Harry Cohen]], [[Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs|Alf Dubs]], [[Millie Miller]], [[Eric Moonman]], and [[David Winnick]].

During the late 1980s and 1990s, with the shift away from the socialist left of the party, and during [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership of the Labour Party, notable senior Jewish politicians included [[Peter Mandelson]], one of the architects of "[[New Labour]]", [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith]], [[Jeremy Beecham, Baron Beecham|The Lord Beecham]], and [[Philip Gould, Baron Gould of Brookwood|The Lord Gould of Brookwood]]. Mandelson, party fund-raiser [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|The Lord Levy]] and [[Jack Straw]] (who is of partial Jewish ancestry), were accused by [[Tam Dalyell]], MP, of being a "[[cabal]] of Jewish advisers" around Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2999219.stm|title=Dalyell's 'Jewish cabal' remarks denied|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Blair's Ministers and Labour backbenchers were Jewish or partially Jewish, including [[Barbara Roche]], [[Margaret Hodge|Dame Margaret Hodge]], [[Fabian Hamilton]], [[Louise Ellman]], [[Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman|The Baroness Hayman]], [[Oona King, Baroness King of Bow|The Baroness King of Bow]], and [[Gillian Merron]]. Labour donors during the 1990s and 2000s who were Jewish included [[David Abrahams (businessman)|David Abrahams]], [[Alexander Bernstein, Baron Bernstein of Craigweil|The Lord Bernstein of Craigweil]], [[Richard Caring]], [[Trevor Chinn|Sir Trevor Chinn]], [[David Garrard (property developer)|Sir David Garrard]], [[Robert Gavron, Baron Gavron|The Lord Gavron]], [[Emmanuel Kaye|Sir Emmanuel Kaye]], [[Andrew Rosenfeld]], [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|The Lord Sainsbury of Turville]], and [[Barry Townsley]]. Several of these were caught up in the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Under the government of Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], brothers [[David Miliband]] and [[Ed Miliband]] became members of the Cabinet. Their father was the Marxist academic [[Ralph Miliband]]. The brothers differed in their view of the party's future direction, and they fought a bitter [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership election]] against each other in 2010. Ed Miliband won the election and became the first Jewish leader of the Labour Party. One of Miliband's Shadow Cabinet members, [[Ivan Lewis]], as well as advisers [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], [[Industrial Areas Foundation|Arnie Graf]], and [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|The Lord Glasman]] are all Jewish.

Current Jewish Labour politicians include: [[William Bach, Baron Bach|William Bach]], [[Steve Bassam, Baron Bassam of Brighton|The Lord Bassam of Brighton]], [[Luciana Berger]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Anthony Grabiner, Baron Grabiner|The Lord Grabiner]], [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]], [[Jonathan Kestenbaum, Baron Kestenbaum|The Lord Kestenbaum]], [[Jonathan Mendelsohn]], [[Janet Neel Cohen, Baroness Cohen of Pimlico|Janet Neel Cohen]], [[Meta Ramsay, Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale|Meta Ramsay]], [[Catherine Stihler]], [[Andrew Stone, Baron Stone of Blackheath|Andrew Stone]], [[Alan Sugar]], [[Leslie Turnberg, Baron Turnberg|Leslie Turnberg]], and [[Robert Winston]].

Since the foundation of the Liberal Democrats, several Jews have achieved prominence: [[David Alliance, Baron Alliance|David Alliance]], the aforementioned Alex Carlisle, [[Miranda Green (journalist)|Miranda Green]], [[Rosalind Grender, Baroness Grender|Olly Grender]], [[Sally Hamwee, Baroness Hamwee|Sally Hamwee]], [[Evan Harris]], [[Susan Kramer, Baroness Kramer|Susan Kramer]], [[Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|Anthony Lester]], [[Jonathan Marks, Baron Marks of Henley-on-Thames|Jonathan Marks]], [[Julia Neuberger, Baroness Neuberger|Julia Neuberger]], [[Monroe Palmer, Baron Palmer of Childs Hill|Monroe Palmer]], [[Paul Strasburger, Baron Strasburger|Paul Strasburger]], and [[Lynne Featherstone]], who became a Minister in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government 2010-15]].

'''''Laissez-faire''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|s|eɪ|ˈ|f|ɛər}}; {{IPA-fr|lɛsefɛʁ|lang|Fr-Laissez-faire.oga}}; from {{Lang-fr|laissez faire|lit=let do}}) is an [[economic system]] in which transactions between private parties are free from [[government]] intervention such as [[regulation]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], [[tariff]]s and [[Subsidy|subsidies]]. The phrase ''laissez-faire'' is part of a larger [[French language|French]] phrase and translates to "let (it/them) do", but in this context usually means "let go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/laissez-faire.html Laissez-faire], Business Dict&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The term ''laissez faire'' likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finances]] [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and a group of French [[businessmen]] headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply "''laissez-nous faire''" ("leave it to us" or "let us do [it]", the French verb not having to take an object).&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AJournal_oeconomique_-_janvier_1751.djvu Journal Oeconomique] 1751, Article by the French minister of finance.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the ''Journal économique'', written by French minister and champion of [[free trade]] [[René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson]]—also the first known appearance of the term in print.&lt;ref&gt;M. d'Argenson, "Lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de Belloni', Avril 1751, ''Journal Oeconomique'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=k4ABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA111#v=onepage p. 111]. See A. Oncken, ''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866&lt;/ref&gt; Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst: {{quote|''Laissez faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est civilisé&amp;nbsp;... Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos voisins&amp;nbsp;! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du cœur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu&amp;nbsp;! Laissez faire !!''&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in J. M. Keynes, 1926, "The End of Laissez Faire". Argenson's ''Mémoirs'' were published only in 1858, ed. Jannet, Tome V, p. 362. See A. Oncken (''Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden'', 1866)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Let go, which should be the motto of all public power, since the world was civilized ... (It is) a detestable principle of those that want to enlarge (themselves) but by the abasement of our neighbours. There is but the wicked and the malignant heart(s) (who are) satisfied by this principle and (its) interest is opposed. Let go, alas".&lt;ref&gt;Original somewhat literal translation using https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/laissez-faire#fr&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|source=}}

[[Vincent de Gournay]], a French [[Physiocracy|Physiocrat]] and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term ''laissez faire'' as he allegedly adopted it from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Baghdiantz McCabe|first= Ina|title= Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|year= 2008|publisher= Berg Publishers|isbn= 978-1-84520-374-0|pages= 271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay coined the phrases ''laissez-faire'' and ''laissez-passer,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Encyclopædia Britannica|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487095/Francois-Quesnay|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''laissez-faire'' being a translation of the Chinese term 無為 [[wu wei]].&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last= Clarke|first= J.J.|title= Oriental Enlightenment: The Encounter Between Asian and Western Thought|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0415133760|page= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert-Le Gendre anecdote,&lt;ref&gt;According to J. [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]'s "Eloge de Vincent de Gournay," '' Mercure'', August, 1759 (repr. in ''Oeuvres of Turgot'', vol. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5KQALAckPr8C&amp;pg=PA288#v=onepage p. 288].&lt;/ref&gt; he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: "''Laissez faire et laissez passer''" ("Let do and let pass"). His motto has also been identified as the longer "''Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!''" ("Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the ''laissez-faire'' slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.&lt;ref&gt;Gournay was credited with the phrase by [[Jacques Turgot]] ("Eloge a Gournay", ''Mercure'' 1759), the [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Marquis de Mirabeau]] (''Philosophie rurale'' 1763 and ''Ephémérides du Citoyen'', 1767.), the [[Comte d'Albon]] (,"Éloge Historique de M. Quesnay", ''Nouvelles Ephémérides Économiques'', May, 1775, pp. 136–37. ) and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|DuPont de Nemours]] (Introduction to ''Oeuvres de Jacques Turgot'', 1808–11, Vol. I, pp. 257, 259 (Daire ed.)) among others&lt;/ref&gt;

Before d'Argenson or Gournay, [[Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert|P. S. de Boisguilbert]] had enunciated the phrase "''on laisse faire la nature''" ("let nature run its course").&lt;ref&gt;"Tant, encore une fois, qu'on laisse faire la nature, on ne doit rien craindre de pareil", P.S. de Boisguilbert, 1707, ''Dissertation de la nature des richesses, de l'argent et des tributs''.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto "''Pas trop gouverner''" ("Govern not too much").&lt;ref&gt;DuPont de Nemours, ''op cit'', p. 258. Oncken (''op.cit'') and Keynes (''op.cit''.) also credit the Marquis d'Argenson with the phrase "''Pour gouverner mieux, il faudrait gouverner moins''" ("To govern best, one needs to govern less"), possibly the source of the famous "That government is best which governs least" motto popular in American circles, attributed variously to [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Henry Thoreau]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gournay's use of the ''laissez-faire'' phrase (as popularized by the Physiocrats) gave it its cachet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Physiocrats proclaimed ''laissez-faire'' in eighteenth-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]], developed the idea.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"&gt;Fine, Sidney. ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State''. United States: The University of Michigan Press, 1964. Print&lt;/ref&gt; "It is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term "''laissez faire''" is ordinarily associated".&lt;ref&gt;Macgregor, ''Economic Thought and Policy'' (London, 1949), pp. 54–67&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a "natural order" or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, a number of "free trade" and "non-interference" slogans{{which|date=December 2016}} had been coined{{By whom|date=December 2016}} as early as the 17th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} but the French phrase ''laissez-faire'' gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. [[George Whatley]]'s 1774 ''Principles of Trade'' (co-authored with [[Benjamin Franklin]]) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote—this may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley's ''Principles of Trade'' are reprinted in ''Works of Benjamin Franklin, Vol.2'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=C2QUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage p. 401]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Spencer]] was opposed to a slightly different application of ''laissez faire''—to "that miserable ''laissez-faire''" that leads to men’s ruin: &lt;blockquote&gt;Along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Part IV of Ethics'' (1892). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Spencer's case, the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of ''laissez-faire'' in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right. So in effect, Spencer decried ''laissez-faire'' socialism.

''Laissez-faire'', a product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], was "conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"&gt;Gaspard, Toufick. ''A Political Economy of Lebanon 1948–2002: The Limits of Laissez-faire''. Boston: Brill, 2004. {{ISBN|978-9004132597}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Adam Smith{{When|date=December 2016}} viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw ''laissez-faire'' as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; By extension, [[free market]]s become a reflection of the natural system of liberty.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; For Smith, ''laissez-faire'' was "a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth".&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;

However, Smith&lt;ref name=asoae /&gt; and the notable [[Classical economics|classical economists]], such as [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]], did not use the phrase. [[Jeremy Bentham]] used the term, but it was probably{{original research inline|date=December 2016}} [[James Mill]]'s reference to the ''laissez-faire'' maxim (together with "''pas trop gouverner''") in an 1824 entry for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Abbott P. Usher|title= Economic History – The Decline of Laissez Faire|year= 1931|journal= American Economic Review|volume= 22|issue= 1, Supplement|pages= 3–10|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

Smith first used the metaphor of an "[[invisible hand]]" in his book ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Marroquin, ''Invisible Hand: The Wealth of Adam Smith'', The Minerva Group, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|1-4102-0288-7}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea lying behind the "invisible hand", though not the metaphor itself, belongs to [[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] and his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]'' (1705). In [[political economy]], that idea and the doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' have long been{{By whom|date=December 2016}} closely related.&lt;ref&gt;John Eatwell, ''The Invisible Hand'', W.W. Norton&amp;Company, 1989, pp. Preface x1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for ''laissez-faire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=zAIar8Ee80QC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=laissez%20faire%20invisible%20hand |title= The mathematical century: the 30 greatest problems of the last 100 years (2006) Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Arturo Sangalli, Freeman J Dyson, p. 122 |publisher= Google.com |accessdate= 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Smith never actually used the term himself.&lt;ref name=asoae&gt;

In ''Third Millennium Capitalism'' (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers, Jr. notes a trend whereby recently "conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term '[[free-market capitalism]]' in lieu of ''laissez-faire''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Wyatt M.|chapter=1: Economic Forces in Modern Capitalism|title=Third Millennium Capitalism: Convergence of Economic, Energy, and Environmental Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7adF9D3OJ0EC|series=ABC-Clio ebook|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|publication-date=2000|page=38|isbn=9781567203608|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
As a system of thought, ''laissez-faire'' rests on the following axioms:&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt;
# The individual is the basic unit in society.
# The individual has a natural right to freedom.
# The physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system.
# Corporations are creatures of the State and therefore the citizenry must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian [[spontaneous order]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'', "The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate." p. 52, http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations_p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These axioms constitute the basic elements of ''laissez-faire'' thought. Another basic and often-disregarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} principle holds that markets should be [[Competition (economics)|competitive]], a rule that the early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' always emphasized.&lt;ref name="Gaspard, Toufick 2004"/&gt; With the aims of maximizing freedom and of allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of ''laissez-faire'' proposed a ''impôt unique'', a [[land value tax|tax on land rent]] to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing [[production (economics)|production]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History of ''laissez-faire'' debate==

===Europe===
In Europe, the ''laissez-faire'' movement was first widely promoted by the [[Physiocracy|Physiocrats]], a movement that originated with [[Vincent de Gournay]], a successful merchant. Gournay adopted the concept, which is the translation of Chinese philosophy [[wu wei]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Gerlach]], [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/daten/2005/gerlach_christian_wu-wei.pdf Wu-Wei in Europe. A Study of Eurasian Economic Thought], London School of Economics – March 2005 p. 3" the diffusion of wu-wei, co-evolved with the inner-European ''laissez-faire'' principle, the Libaniusian model." p. 8 "Thus, wu-wei has to be recognized as a ''laissez-faire'' instrument of Chinese political economy "p. 10 "Practising wu-wei erzhi. Consequently, it is this variant of the ''laissez-faire'' maxim in which the basis of Physiocracy's ‘moral philosophy’ is to be located. Priddat's work made clear that the wu-wei of the complete économie has to be considered central to Physiocracy; "p. 11 "that wu-wei translates into French as laissez-faire"&lt;/ref&gt; from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Gournay held that the government should allow the [[natural law|laws of nature]] to govern economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. His ideas were taken up by [[François Quesnay]] and [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], Baron de l'Aulne. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and in 1754 persuaded him to give ''laissez-faire'' a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain and for more than a decade the experiment was a success, but then in 1768 there was a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the edict allowing [[free trade]] was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', pp. 71–77, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''laissez-faire'' became an integral part of [[Classical liberalism|nineteenth-century European liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Just as liberals supported [[freedom of thought]] in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of [[free trade]] and [[free competition]] in the sphere of economics. The state was to be merely a [[Night-watchman state|passive policeman]], protecting [[private property]] and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen and particularly British industrialists were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests.&lt;ref name="Fine, Sidney 1964"/&gt; Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in [[Sweden]], [[Tuscany]], [[Spain]] and after 1776 in the newly created [[United States]]. [[Adam Smith]], author of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.&lt;ref&gt;Will &amp; Ariel Durant, ''Rousseau and the Revolution'', p. 76, Simon and Schuster, 1967, {{ISBN|067163058X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'' was founded in 1843 and became an influential voice for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott Gordon|title=The London Economist and the High Tide of Laissez Faire|year=1955|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=63|issue=6|pages=461–88|doi=10.1086/257722}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laissez-faire'' advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the [[British Empire]]. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in [[Ireland]], founder of ''The Economist'' [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] wrote: "It is no man's business to provide for another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cormac Ó Gráda]]|title=The Great Irish Famine|year=1995|chapter=section: ''Ideology and relief'' in Chpt. 2|isbn=9780521557870|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Economist'' campaigned against the [[Corn Laws]] that protected landlords in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed.&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

A group calling itself the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester Liberals]], to which [[Richard Cobden]] and Richard Wright belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade and their work was carried on, after the death of Richard Cobden in 1866, by ''The Cobden Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Clubs in the Late Nineteenth Century |url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/economics/history/paper28/28taddeiweb1.pdf |format=PDF|author=Antonia Taddei|year=1999|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, a [[Cobden-Chevalier Treaty|trade treaty]] was signed between Britain and France, after which several of these treaties were signed among other European countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The breakdown of the ''laissez-faire'' practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Jones |first= G.

===United States===
Frank Bourgin's study of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]].&lt;ref name=bourgin&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank|last=Bourgin|title=The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic|isbn=0-06-097296-3|year=1989|publisher=George Braziller Inc.|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. One later result of this intent was the adoption of Richard Farrington's new plan (worked out with his co-worker John Jefferson) to incorporate new changes during the [[New Deal]]. Others, including Jefferson, view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter [[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourgin |first=Frank |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frank-bourgin/the-great-challenge-the-myth-of-laissez-faire-i/ |title=THE GREAT CHALLENGE: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic by Frank Bourgin &amp;#124; Kirkus |publisher=Kirkusreviews.com |date=1989-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism]] in the United States in the 19th century had distinctive characteristics and that "at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean "no government intervention" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers".

Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the Civil War include the establishment of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent Office]] in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various [[United States Army|Army]] expeditions to the west, beginning with [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]]'s [[Corps of Discovery]] in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]] and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]] and [[Second Bank of the United States]] as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the [[Tariff of Abominations|tariff of 1828]]). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President [[George Washington]] in the absence of an agreement that was reached between [[Alexander Hamilton]] and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the [[District of Columbia]]. In contrast to Hamilton and the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] was [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]'s opposing political party, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]].

Most of the early opponents of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the United States subscribed to the [[American School (economics)|American School]]. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a [[First Bank of the United States|government-sponsored bank]] and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton's death, the more abiding [[Protectionism|protectionist]] influence in the antebellum period came from [[Henry Clay]] and his ''[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]''.

Following the Civil War, the movement towards a [[mixed economy]] accelerated. Protectionism increased with the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 and the [[Dingley Tariff]] of 1897. [[Government regulation]] of the economy expanded with the enactment of the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]] and the [[Sherman Anti-trust Act]].

The [[Progressive Era]] saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration's [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]] program.

Following [[World War I]] and the [[Great Depression]], the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined [[free enterprise]] with a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by "voluntary" export restrictions from [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert W.

A more recent advocate of total ''laissez-faire'' has been [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[Ayn Rand]], who described it as "the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State".&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 7, New American Library, Signet, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the "Iron Law of Regulation", which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J.

A closely related conception is that of raw/pure capitalism or unrestrained capitalism that refers to capitalism free of social [[regulation]]s,&lt;ref name="capfree"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolan|first1=Peter|title=Capitalism and Freedom: The Contradictory Character of Globalisation|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843312826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQdQDJzOkBMC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with low, minimal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orchard|first1=Lionel|last2=Stretton|first2=Hugh|title=Public Goods, Public Enterprise, Public Choice: Theoretical Foundations of the Contemporary Attack on Government|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349235056|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwW_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or no government and operating almost entirely on the [[profit motive]]. Other than ''laissez-faire'' economics and [[anarcho-capitalism]] it is not associated with a school of thought and typically has a bad connotation which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.

[[Robert Kuttner]] states that "for over a century, popular struggles in the [[democracies]] have used the [[nation-state]] to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=Globalization and Its Critics|url=|publisher=The American Prospect|accessdate=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, [[durability]], [[sustainability]], respect for the [[Environmental protection|environment]] and human beings as well as a lack of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerckhove|first1=Gilbert Van|title=Toxic Capitalism: The Orgy of Consumerism and Waste: Are We the Last Generation on Earth?|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477219065|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POefWmtaZcgC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this more critical angle, companies might (naturally) aim to "maximise profits" at the expense of workers' and broader social interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Müntefering's criticism of raw capitalism strikes a chord|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6af06832-bdda-11d9-87aa-00000e2511c8.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
{{Further|Criticism of capitalism}}
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of ''laissez-faire'' economics.

[[Adam Smith]] acknowledges deep moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"&gt;Spencer J. Pack. Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy. Great Britain: Edward Elgar, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Smith had severe misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society: the landlords, the workers and the capitalists.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; Smith claimed "[t]he landlords' role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests"&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt; and that "[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords". According to Smith, the landlords should thus be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations. Unfortunately, they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness.&lt;ref name="Spencer J. Pack 2010"/&gt;

The British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] condemned ''laissez-faire'' economic policy on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler, Gilles, ''Keynes and His Battles'' (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The End of Laissez-faire'' (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of ''laissez-faire'' are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and Keynes says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dostaler 2007, p. 91; Barnett, Vincent, ''John Maynard Keynes'' (Routledge, 2013), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated that a freely competitive, ''laissez-faire'' banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical. He stated that the need for [[central banking]] control was inescapable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Lawrence H.|title=Why Didn't Hayek Favor Laissez Faire in Banking?|journal=History of Political Economy|year=1999|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://cameroneconomics.com/white-hayek-hope.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2013|doi=10.1215/00182702-31-4-753|pages=753–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polish Sejm 1622.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sejm session at the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw]], 1622]]
The '''''liberum veto''''' ([[Latin]] for "free veto") was a parliamentary device in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the [[Sejm]] (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting, '''Sisto activitatem!''' (Latin: "I stop the activity!") or '''Nie pozwalam!''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: "I do not allow!"). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The ''liberum veto'' was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive ([[absolute monarchy]]).

Many historians hold that the ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the [[partitions of Poland]] and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland for the next 200 years or so. [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the "''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy". In the period of 1573–1763, about 150 sejms were held, about a third failing to pass any legislation, mostly because of the ''liberum veto''. The expression ''[[Polish parliament (expression)|Polish parliament]]'' in many European languages originated from the apparent paralysis.

==Origin==
The rule evolved from the principle of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision-making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt; Each deputy to a Sejm was elected at a [[sejmik]] (the local ''sejm'' for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt; Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered a violation of the principle of political equality.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt;

At first, the dissenting deputies were often convinced or cowed back to withdraw their objections.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt; Also, at first, the rule was used to strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed.&lt;ref name="Czaplinski-29"/&gt; For example, as historian [[Władysław Czapliński]] describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed.&lt;ref name=Czaplinski-29/&gt; From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;

It is commonly and erroneously, believed that a Sejm was first disrupted by the ''liberum veto'' by a [[Trakai]] deputy, [[Władysław Siciński]], in 1652.&lt;ref name="Jasienica"/&gt; In reality, he vetoed only the continuation of the Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent.&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-117-119"/&gt; Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-117-119"/&gt; Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in [[Kraków]], the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the ''liberum veto'' before it had finished its deliberations&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; by the [[Kiev]] deputy, [[Adam Olizar]].&lt;ref name="Korzon1898"/&gt; The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] was elected.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt;

==Zenith==
During the reign of [[John III Sobieski]] (1674–1696), half of Sejm proceedings were scuttled by the veto.&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; The practice also spread from the national Sejm to local sejmik proceedings.&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; In the first half of the 18th century, it became increasingly common for Sejm sessions to be broken up by the ''liberum veto'', as the Commonwealth's neighbours, chiefly [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]], found it to be a useful tool to frustrate attempts at reforming and strengthening the Commonwealth. By bribing deputies to exercise their vetoes, Poland's neighbours could derail any measures not to their liking.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt; The Commonwealth deteriorated from a European power into a state of anarchy.&lt;ref name="obywatelskiego"/&gt; Only a few Sejms were able to meet during the reign of the [[House of Saxony]] in Poland (1696–1763), the last one in 1736.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt; Only 8 out of the 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1697–1733) passed legislation.&lt;ref name="Wandycz2001-103-104"/&gt; For a period of 30 years around the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation (1734–1763).&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt; The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term "Polish anarchy", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt;

Disruption of the Commonwealth governance caused by the liberum veto was highly significant. From 1573 to 1763, about 150 Sejms where held, of which 53 failed to pass any legislation.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt; Historian [[Jacek Jędruch]] notes that out of the 53 disrupted Sejms, 32 were disrupted by the ''liberum veto''.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-128"/&gt;

==Final years==
The 18th century saw an institution known as a "[[confederated sejm]]" evolve.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; It was a parliament session that operated under the rules of a confederation.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Its primary purpose was to avoid disruption by the ''liberum veto'', unlike the national Sejm, which was being paralyzed by the veto.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed of the whole membership of the national Sejm so that the ''liberum veto'' would not operate.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-136-138"/&gt;

The second half of the 18th century, marking the age of the [[Enlightenment in Poland]], also witnessed an increased trend aiming at the reform of the inefficient governance of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="bardach284-287"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach289"/&gt; Reforms of 1764–1766 improved the proceedings of the Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach293-294"/&gt; Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed.&lt;ref name="bardach293-294"/&gt; The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the ''liberum veto'' and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the [[Cardinal Laws]] of 1768.&lt;ref name="bardach297-298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005-391"/&gt;

The ''liberum veto'' was finally abolished by the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], adopted by a confederated sejm, which permanently established the principle of majority rule.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; The achievements of that constitution, however, which historian [[Norman Davies]] called "the first constitution of its kind in Europe",&lt;ref name="Europe: A History"/&gt; were undone by another confederated sejm, meeting at [[Grodno]] in 1793. That Sejm, under duress from Russia and Prussia, ratified the [[Second Partition of Poland]], anticipating the [[Third Partition of Poland]], the final disappearance of the Polish-Lithuanian state just two years later.&lt;ref name="Davies2005-405"/&gt;

==Significance==
Harvard political scientist [[Grzegorz Ekiert]], assessing the history of the ''liberum veto'' in Poland, concludes:
: The principle of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened the role of the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Ekiert, “Veto, Liberum,” in  Seymour Martin Lipset, ed. ‘’The Encyclopedia of Democracy’’ (1998) 4:1341&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Dalibor Roháč]] noted that the "principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of [[constitutionalism]]" and acted as a significant constraint on the powers of the monarch by making the "rule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism."&lt;ref name="Rohac2008"/&gt; It was seen as one of the key principles of the Commonwealth political system and culture, the [[Golden Liberty]].&lt;ref name="bardach248-249"/&gt;

At the same time, historians hold that the principle of ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system and Commonwealth's eventual downfall.&lt;ref name=Jasienica/&gt; Deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of "Golden Age", for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth's government, stemming any attempts at reform.&lt;ref name="BullittSempa2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdamsCarey2000"/&gt; [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the "''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy."&lt;ref name="Wandycz1980"/&gt; Wagner echoed him thus: "Certainly, there was no other institution of old Poland which has been more sharply criticized in more recent times than this one.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=W.J.|title=May 3, 1791, and the Polish constitutional tradition|journal=The Polish Review|date=1992|volume=36|issue=4|pages=383–395|jstor=25778591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern parallels and popular culture==
A 2004 Polish [[collectible card game]], ''[[Veto (game)|Veto]]'', set in the background of a [[royal election in Poland|royal election]] during an [[general sejm|election sejm]], is named after this procedure.&lt;ref name="boardgamegeek"/&gt;

Until the early 1990s, [[IBM]] had a decision-making process called "non-concur" in which any department head could veto a company-wide strategy if it did not fit in with his department's outlook. That effectively turned IBM into several independent [[fiefdom]]s. "Non-concur" was eliminated by CEO [[Louis Gerstner]], who was brought in to revive the declining company.&lt;ref name="An executive dressing down"/&gt;

The '''Order of La Pléiade''' ({{Lang-fr|Ordre de la Pléiade de l'Association des parlementaires de langue française}})&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes referred to in English as the Order of the Pleiades: http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2947&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[order (honour)|honorary order]] of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]. It recognizes people who particularly distinguished themselves in the service of its ideals of cooperation and friendship, promoting the role of the [[French language]] in their own countries or in the world. It was created in 1976 on initiative of the [[Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie]]. 

== Origin of the name ==
In this reverse chronological list, each item intentionally referred to the following (historically preceding) one:

# '''Order of La Pléiade''';
# [[La Pléiade]], a group of (originally seven) [[French Renaissance literature|French Renaissance]] poets;
# the [[Alexandrian Pleiad]] of seven [[Alexandria]]n poets and tragedians (3rd century B.C.);
# the seven main stars of the [[Pleiades|Pleiades star cluster]] in the western astronomical tradition, and the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]], seven sisters in the Greek mythology.

== Classes ==
There are five classes (in descending [[order of precedence]]):
# ''[[Grand Cross]]'' (Grand-croix)
# ''Grand Officer'' (Grand Officier)
# ''Commander'' ([[Commandeur]])
# ''Officer'' (Officier)
# ''Knight'' (Chevalier)

== Insignia ==
The ''badge'' of the Order of La Pléiade is a seven-pointed star, blue enameled at both sides. The obverse&lt;ref&gt;For "obverse" and "reverse", see: [[Obverse and reverse]]&lt;/ref&gt; silver central disc features a silver-colored [[compass rose]], surrounded by a blue enamel and silver edged ring with the text "la Pléiade, ordre de la Francophonie", itself surrounded by seven small silver stars. The reverse silver central disc features the [[Adolphe Bridge]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]], where the [[Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie]] was founded, and symbolizes unity.

The [[ribbon]] is [[sky blue]] with small yellow stripes near each border.

[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], identified the Other as one of the conceptual bases of [[intersubjectivity]], of the relations among people.]]

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the terms '''the Other''' and '''the Constitutive Other''' identify the other human being, in their differences from the Self, as being a cumulative, constituting factor in the [[self-image]] of a person; as their acknowledgement of [[Reality|being real]]; hence, the Other is dissimilar to and the opposite of the Self, of Us, and of the Same.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Other", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, (1999) p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutive Other is the relation between the [[personality]] (essential nature) and the person (body) of a human being; it is the relation of [[Essentialism|essential]] and superficial characteristics of [[personal identity]] that corresponds to the relationship between opposite but correlative characteristics of the Self, because the difference is inner-difference, within the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hegel, G.

V.|editor1-last=Hoffmeister|editor1-first=J.|title=Force and the Understanding: Appearance and the Supersensible World: Phenomenology of Spirit|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York &lt;!--|DUPLICATE_pages=517–18--&gt;|edition=5th|pages=98–9|quote=The relation of essential nature to outward manifestation in pure change ... to infinity ... as inner difference ... [is within] its own Self.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Findlay, J. N.|author2=Hegel, G. W. F.|author3=Miller, A. V.|editor1-last=Hoffmeister|editor1-first=J.|title=Analysis of the Text: Phenomenology of Spirit|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=517–18|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition and quality of '''Otherness''', the characteristics of the Other, is the state of being different from and alien to the [[Identity (social science)|social identity]] of a person and to the [[identity (philosophy)|identity of the Self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Miller, J.|url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/view/research/n304.xml|title=Otherness|website=The SAGE encyclopedia of qualitative research methods.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2015|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=588–591|doi=10.4135/9781412963909.n304|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[discourse]] of philosophy, the term Otherness identifies and refers to the characteristics of ''Who?'' and ''What?'' of the Other, which are distinct and separate from [[the Symbolic]] order of things; from [[the Real]] (the authentic and unchangeable); from the [[Aesthetics|æsthetic]] ([[art]], [[beauty]], [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]); from [[political philosophy]]; from [[Norm (social)|social norm]]s and [[identity (social science)|social identity]]; and from the [[Self]]. Therefore, the condition of Otherness is a person's non-conformity to and with the social norms of society; and Otherness is the condition of [[disenfranchisement]] (political exclusion), effected either by the [[State (polity)|State]] or by the social institutions (e.g. the [[profession]]s) invested with the corresponding socio-political [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Therefore, the imposition of Otherness [[Social alienation|alienates]] the labelled person from the centre of society, and places him or her at the margins of society, for being the Other.&lt;ref&gt;"Otherness", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Othering''' describes the reductive action of labeling a person as someone who belongs to a subordinate social category defined as the Other. The practice of Othering is the exclusion of persons who do not fit the norm of the [[social group]], which is a version of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;"Othering", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in [[human geography]], to ''other'' an individual identifies and excludes them from the social group, placing them at the margins of society where social norms do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===European philosophy===
[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The idealist philosopher G. W. F. Hegel introduced the concept of the Other as constituent part of human preoccupation with the Self.]]
[[File:Emmanuel Levinas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ethical philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas associated the concept of the Other with the ethical systems proposed in scripture and tradition.]]
The concept of the [[Self]] requires the existence of '''the Other''' as the counterpart entity required for '''defining the Self'''; in the late 18th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) introduced the concept of the Other as a constituent part of [[self-consciousness]] (preoccupation with the Self),&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 1, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; which complements the propositions about [[self-awareness]] (capacity for introspection) proffered by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814).&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 8, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807)

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) applied the concept of the Other as a basis for [[intersubjectivity]], the psychological relations among people. In ''[[Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology]]'' (1931), Husserl said that the Other is constituted as an ''alter ego'', as an other self. As such, the Other person posed and was an epistemological problem—of being only a perception of the consciousness of the Self.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

In ''[[Being and Nothingness|Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]]'' (1943), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980) applied the dialectic of intersubjectivity to describe how the world is altered by the appearance of the Other, of how the world then appears to be oriented to the Other person, and not to the Self. The Other appears as a psychological phenomenon in the course of a person's life, and not as a radical threat to the [[existence]] of the Self. In that mode, in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) applied the concept of Otherness to Hegel's dialectic of the "[[Master–slave dialectic|Lord and Bondsman]]" (''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'') and found it to be like the dialectic of the Man–Woman relationship, thus a true explanation for society's treatment and mistreatment of women.

===European psychology===
The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) and the ethical philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995) established the contemporary definitions, usages, and applications of the Other, as the radical counterpart of the Self. Lacan associated the Other with language and with [[The Symbolic|the symbolic order]] of things. Levinas associated the Other with the ethical metaphysics of [[scripture]] and [[tradition]]; the ethical proposition is that the Other is superior and prior to the Self.

In the event, Levinas re-formulated the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter (wherein a person is responsible to the Other person) to include the propositions of [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) about the impossibility of the Other (person) being an entirely [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysical pure-presence]]. That the Other could be an entity of pure Otherness (of [[alterity]]) personified in a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] created and depicted with language that identifies, describes, and classifies. The conceptual re-formulation of the nature of the Other also included Levinas's analysis of the distinction between "[[the saying and the said]]"; nonetheless, the nature of the Other retained the priority of [[ethics]] over [[metaphysics]].

In the psychology of the mind (e.g. [[R. D. Laing]]), the Other identifies and refers to [[The unconscious|the unconscious mind]], to [[silence]], to [[insanity]], and to language ("to what is referred and to what is unsaid").&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999 )p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in such psychologic and analytic usages, there might arise a tendency to [[relativism]] if the Other person (as a being of pure, abstract alterity) leads to ignoring the commonality of [[truth]]. Likewise, problems arise from unethical usages of the terms The Other, Otherness, and Othering to reinforce [[Ontology|ontological divisions]] of reality: of [[being]], of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and of [[existence]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

===Levinas on ethics===
In ''[[Totality and Infinity|Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority]]'' (1961), Emmanuel Levinas said that previous philosophy had reduced the Other person to an object of consciousness, by not preserving its absolute ''[[alterity]]''—the innate condition of otherness, by which the Other radically transcends the Self and the totality of the human network into which the Other is being placed. As a challenge to self-assurance, the existence of the Other is a matter of ethics, because the ethical priority of the Other equals the primacy of ethics over ontology in real life.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

From that perspective, Levinas described the nature of the Other as "insomnia and wakefulness"; an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] (an exteriority) towards the Other that forever remains beyond any attempt at fully capturing the Other, whose Otherness is infinite; even in the murder of an Other, their Otherness remains uncontrolled and not negated. The infinity of the Other allowed Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to that ethic; thus:

{{quotation|The others that obsess me in the Other do not affect me as examples of the same [[genus]] united with my neighbor, by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block ... The others concern me from the first. Here, fraternity precedes the commonness of a genus. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others. |''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'' (1974), p. 159.&lt;ref&gt;Levinas, Emmanuel. ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===More recent critical theory===
Derrida proposed that the absolute ''[[alterity]]'' of the Other is compromised because the Other is ''other than'' the Self and the group. That logical problem has especially negative consequences in the realm of human geography when the Other person is denied ethical priority in geopolitical discourse. Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse ([[Oriental Studies]]) about Western encounters with non–Western cultures preserves the dominantor–dominated discourse of [[hegemony]], just as misrepresenting the feminine as Other reasserts [[male privilege]] as primary in social discourse.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), the geographer [[Derek Gregory]] said that the responses of U.S. President George W. Bush (2001–2009) to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 reinforced philosophic divisions of connotation and denotation that perpetuated the negative representation of the non-Western Other, when he rhetorically asked the U.S. populace ''Why do they hate us?'' as political prelude to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's rhetorical question led the U.S. populace to make an artificial, Us-and-Them division in the relations between the U.S. and the countries and cultures of the Middle East, which artifice is a basic factor of the perpetual war on [[terrorism]], and is a step away from eradicating the imaginary representations of the Self and the Other created with the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] geographies produced by [[Oriental Studies]]; about which the cultural critic [[Edward Saïd]] said that:

{{quotation|To build a conceptual framework around a notion of Us-versus-Them is, in effect, to pretend that the principal consideration is [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and natural—our civilization is known and accepted, theirs is different and strange—whereas, in fact, the framework separating us from them is belligerent, constructed, and situational.|''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imperialism and colonialism==
The contemporary, world system of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]], nation-states (with interdependent politics and economies) was preceded by the European imperial system of [[Colonialism|colonies]] (settler and economic) in which "the creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states, and often in the form of an empire, [was] based on [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] and [[Hierarchy|subordination]]."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R.J., ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 4th Edition Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; In the imperialist world system, political and economic affairs were fragmented, and the discrete empires "provided for most of their own needs ... [and disseminated] their influence solely through conquest [empire] or the threat of conquest [hegemony]."&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, James L. ''The Modern Middle East: A History'', 2nd ed. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
The imperial conquest of "non-white" countries was intellectually justified with the [[Fetishism|fetishization]] of the Eastern world, which was effected with cultural generalizations that divided the peoples of the world into the artificial, binary relationship of "The Eastern World and The Western World", the dichotomy which identified, designated, and subordinated the peoples of the Orient as the Other—as the non–European Self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 27 January 2016|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of fetishization of people and things is a function of [[Orientalism]], which the colonialist ideologue realises with three actions: (i) Homogenization (all Oriental peoples are the same folk); (ii) Feminization (Oriental people are the lessers in the East–West binary relationship); and (iii) Essentialization (a people reduced to the artificial essence of universal, innate characteristics); thus, the praxis of Othering reduced to cultural inferiority the people, places, and things of the Eastern world, which then justified colonialism by establishing the West as the superior standard of culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Patheon Books|year = 1978|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race ===
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific racism of the Other: In the late-19th century, H. Strickland Constable justified anti-Irish racism among white people by claiming similarity between the cranial features of "the Irish-Iberian" man (left) and "the Negro" man (right), as proof that each man is racially inferior to the Anglo-Teutonic man (centre) possessed of the cranial ideal.]]

The practice of Othering was the prevalent cultural perspective of the European imperial powers, which was supported by the fabrications of [[scientific racism]], such as the pseudo-intellectual belief that the size of the cranium of the non–European Other was indicative of the inferior intelligence of the coloured peoples designated as the non-white Other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the United Nations officially declared that the differences among the races were insignificant in relation to the anthropological sameness among the peoples who are the human race. Despite the facts, in the U.S., the artificial distinctions against the Other remain, especially in government forms that ask a U.S. citizen to identify and place him or herself into a racial category, as in the questionnaires of the census bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In practice of Othering, immigrants and refugees  are seen as "illegal immigrants" (from overseas) and "illegal aliens" (from Mexico).

===The subaltern native===
Maintaining an empire requires the [[Cultural imperialism|cultural subordination]] of the Other into the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern native]] (the colonized people), which facilitates the exploitation of their labour, of their lands, and of the natural resources of their country as a colony of the motherland. To realise those ends, the process of Othering culturally justifies the domination and subordination of the native people, by placing them (as the Other) at the social periphery of the geopolitical enterprise that is colonial imperialism. The colonizer creates the Other with a false dichotomy of "native weakness" (social and political, cultural and economic) against the "colonial strength" of imperial [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be resolved only with the ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' of racialism—the "moral responsibility" that psychologically authorizes the colonialist Self to unilaterally assume a [[civilizing mission]] to educate, convert, and culturally assimilate the Other into the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the praxis of [[colonialism]], the native populace constitute the Other whom the colonizers mean to dominate in order to civilise and save them in the course of exploiting the natural and human resources of the natives' homeland.&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"&gt;Mountz, A. (n.d.). ''The Other''. Key Concepts in Political Geography, pp. 328–338. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a colony is a way to dominate and dispose of two groups of people (colonists and colonised) who can be used to define the Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikiwash.metronews.ca/other/703349669-703223196|title=WikiWash|website=wikiwash.metronews.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Othering establishes the unequal relationship between the native people and the colonizers, who believe themselves essentially superior to the natives whom they reduced to inhuman inferiority, as "the Other".&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"&gt;Colonialism. (n.d.). Dictionary of Human Geography, pp. 94–98. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehumanisation of colonialism—the colonist "Self" against the colonised "Other"—is maintained with the false binary-relations of [[Class (social)|social class]] and [[race (human categorization)|race]], of [[sex]] and [[gender]], and of [[nation]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"/&gt; The proper, profitable functioning of a colony features continual protection of such cultural demarcations, which establish and enforce the socio-economic binary relation between "civilized man" (the colonist) and "savage man" (the colonial subaltern).&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"/&gt;

==Sex and gender==
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The existential philosopher Simone de Beauvoir applied the concept of The Other to the man–woman binary relation, in critical of the dominator–dominated relation, which historically characterised sexual inequality.]]

The existential philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]'s conception of "the Other" (as a constituent part of [[Self-awareness|self-consciousness]]) to describe a male-dominated culture that represents Woman as the sexual Other in relation to Man. In the cultural context of the Man–Woman binary relation, the sexual Other is a [[minority (philosophy)|minority]], the least-favoured social group, usually the women of the community, because "a man represents both the positive and the neutral, as indicated by the common use of [the word] ''Man'' to designate human beings in general; whereas [the word] ''Woman'' represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity" from the first sex, from Man.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949)

In 1957, [[Betty Friedan]] substantiated the ordinate–subordinate nature of the Man–Woman sexual relation as social identity. When queried about their post-graduate lives, the majority of women interviewed, at a university-class reunion, used binary gender language, and referred to and identified themselves as their roles (wife, mother, manager) in the private sphere. They did not identify their own achievements (career, job, business) in the public sphere of life. Unawares, the women had conventionally automatically identified themselves as the social Other. Although the nature of the social Other is influenced by the society's social constructs ([[social class]], [[sex]], [[gender]]), as a human organisation, society holds the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] (social and political) to formally change the social relation between the male-defined Self and ''Woman'', the non-male Other.&lt;ref&gt;Haslanger&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963)

The [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] [[Cheshire Calhoun]] deconstructed the concept of "the Other" as the female-half of the binary-gender relation of the "Man and Woman" concept. [[Deconstruction]] of the word ''Woman''—from subordinate in the "Man ''and'' Woman" relation—conceptually [[Reconstructivism|reconstructed]] the female Other as the Woman who exists independently of male definition ([[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]); independent of the patriarchy who formally realise female subordination with binary-gender usages of the word ''Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarojinisahoo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), Prof. Sarojini Sahoo said that despite equality with men, women possess a discrete identity that is independent of the male definition of ''woman''.]]
In the essay "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), the academic [[Sarojini Sahoo]], agrees with De Beauvoir's proposition that women can be free of social subordination by "thinking, taking action, working, creating, on the same terms as men; instead of seeking to disparage them, she declares herself their equal." Yet counters De Beauvoir that despite having the same human-being status as men, women have a unique sexual [[Gender identity|identity]] different from men. In feminist definition, Women are the Other (but not the Hegelian Other) and are not existentially defined by the demands of Man. Women are the social Other who unknowingly accept subjugation as part of [[subjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com|title=Sense &amp; Sensuality|website=sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the identity of woman is constitutionally different from the identity of man, as human beings, men and women are equal. Hence, the harm of Othering arises from the asymmetric nature of sex and gender roles, which arises accidentally and "passively" from natural and unavoidable [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jemmer, Patrick. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YlN_kz8th4cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Sarojini+Sahoo&amp;ots=EFtjSxyA3q&amp;sig=qa7R The O(the)r (O)the(r)], Engage Newcastle Volume 1 ({{ISSN|2045-0567}}; {{ISBN|978-1-907926-00-6}}) August 2010, Newcastle UK: NewPhilSoc Publishing, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social-exclusion function of Othering a person or a social group from society, for being different from the norm (of the Self), is understood in the socio-economic functions of gender (a [[social construct]]) and sex (biological reality). In a society where heterosexuality is the social norm, "the Other" refers to and identifies the same-sex orientation, lesbians (women who love women) and gays (men who love men), people identified as "deviant" from the binary socio-sexual norm.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt; Negative usages of "the Other" are applied to the lesbian and gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities to diminish their social status and political power by social Othering to the margins of society. To neutralise Othering, LGBT communities ''queer'' a city, create social spaces, that use the city's spatial and temporal plans to allow the LGBT community free expression of [[social identity]] (i.e. a gay-pride parade); as such, ''queering'' is a political means for the sexual Other to establish their [[reality]] as part of the urban body politic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge==

===Representations===
Regarding the production of [[knowledge]] about the Other, Michel Foucault and the [[Frankfurt School]] identified the process of '''Othering''' as everything to do with the creation and maintenance of imaginary representations—"knowledge of the Other"—in service to geopolitical [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]. The [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of the Other (metaphoric, metonymic, anthropomorphic) are manifestations of the Western cultural attitudes inherent to the European historiographies of the non–European peoples labelled as "the Other". Using analytical discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) the [[dominant ideology]] of the colonialist culture explains the Eastern world to the Western world, using the binary relationship of the European Self confronting the non–European Other from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th-century [[Historiography|historiographies]] of the [[Orient]] as a place, European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studied only what they argued was the [[high culture]]—the languages and literatures, the arts and philologies—of the Middle East as a cultural region, rather than as a geopolitical place inhabited by different peoples and societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; About such cultural misrepresentation, Saïd said that "the Orient that appears in Orientalism, then, is a system of representations framed by a whole set of forces that brought the Orient into Western learning, Western consciousness, and later, Western empire. If this definition of Orientalism seems more political than not, that is simply because I think Orientalism was, itself, a product of certain political forces and activities. Orientalism is a school of interpretation whose material happens to be the Orient, its civilisations, peoples, and localities. Its objective discoveries—the work of innumerable devoted scholars who edited texts and translated them, codified grammars, wrote dictionaries, reconstructed dead epochs, produced positivistically verifiable learning—are and always have been conditioned by the fact that its truths, like any truths delivered by language, are embodied in language, and, what is the truth of language?, Nietzsche once said, but":

{{quotation| A mobile army of [[metaphor]]s, [[metonym]]s, and [[anthropomorphism]]s—in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which, after long use, seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.|''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;ref name=Said&gt;Saïd, Edward W. ''Orientalism'', 25th Anniversary Ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202}}}}

Saïd concludes that Nietzsche's perspective might be too [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], but that it draws attention to the fact that, in so far as "the Orient" occurred in the [[Existentialism|existential]] awareness of the Western world, the Orient was a word that later accrued to it a wide field of meanings, associations, and connotations, which did not refer to the real Eastern world, but to the field of study surrounding "the Orient" as a word.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy===
In the Eastern world, the field of [[Occidentalism]], the investigation programme and academic curriculum of and about [[Essentialism|the essence]] of [[Western world|The West]]—i.e. geographic Europe as a culturally homogenous place—did not exist as a counterpart to Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Steven R. "The Historiography of the Modern Middle East: Transforming a Field of Study",  ''Middle East Historiographies: Narrating the Twentieth Century'', Israel Gershoni, Amy Singer, Y. Hakam Erdem, Eds. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2006. pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the Orientalist practices of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical negationism]], the writing of distorted history about the places and peoples of "The East" continue in the [[postmodern]] era, especially in contemporary journalism; e.g. in the Third World, political parties practice intra-national Othering with fabricated "facts", such as threat-reports about non-existent threats (political, social, military) that are meant to aggravate the character faults of the opponent political parties, which usually are composed of people from the social and ethnic groups identified and designated as the Other in that society.&lt;ref&gt;Sehgal, Meera. "Manufacturing a Feminized Siege Mentality." ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'' '''36''' (2) (2007): p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of Othering a person or a social group, by means of an ideal [[ethnocentricity]] (belief that one's ethnic group is the superior group), and the cultural tendency to evaluate and assign [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]] to Other ethnicities, which are negatively measured against the ideal standard of the Self—is realised through mundane methods of investigation, such as [[cartography]].&lt;ref name=Fellman&gt;Fellmann, Jerome D., et al. ''Human Geography: Landscapes of Human Activities'', 10th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

Historically, the drawing of maps emphasised and bolstered specific lands and the associated national-identities, the natural resources and cultures of the native inhabitants. In early cartography, the distortion (proportionate, proximate, and commercial) of actual places and true distances established the Western cartographer's [[Geopolitics|homeland]] as the centre of the ''mapamundi''; thus British cartographers centred Britain in their maps, and drew the British islands proportionally larger than the true geography might allow. In contemporary cartography, polar-perspective maps of the northern hemisphere, drawn by American cartographers, distort real geographic spatial relations (distance, size, mass) of and between the U.S. and Russia, to emphasise American superiority (military, cultural, geopolitical) and the inferiority of the Russian Other.&lt;ref name=Fellman/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Practical perspectives===
In ''Key Concepts in Political Geography'' (2009), Alison Mountz proposed concrete definitions of the Other as a philosophic concept and term within the field of phenomenology; when used as a noun, the Other identifies and refers to a person and to a group of persons; when used as a verb, the Other identifies and refers to a category and a label for persons and things.

Post-colonial scholarship demonstrated that, in pursuit of empire, "the colonizing powers narrated an 'Other' whom they set out to save, dominate, control, [and] civilize ... [in order to] extract resources through colonization" of the homeland of the people labelled as the Other.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"&gt;Gallagher, Carolyn, Dahlman, Carl T, Gilmartin, Mary, Mountz, Alison, Shirlow, Peter. ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As facilitated by [[Orientalism|Orientalist representations]] of the non–Western Other, [[Colonialism|colonisation]]—the economic exploitation of a people and their land—is misrepresented as being for the material, spiritual, and cultural benefit of the colonised peoples.

Counter to the post-colonial perspective of the Other as part of a Dominator–Dominated binary relationship, post-modern philosophy presents the Other and Otherness as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] progress for Man and society. Public knowledge of the [[social identity]] of peoples [[Social class|classified]] as "Outsiders" is ''de facto'' acknowledgement of their being [[reality|real]], and so they are part of the [[body politic]], especially in the cities. As such, "the post-modern city is a geographical celebration of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] that moves sites once conceived of as 'marginal' to the [social] centre of discussion and analysis" of the [[Intersubjectivity|human relations]] between the Outsiders and the Establishment.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13371">'''Pacification theory''' is a counter-hegemonic approach to the study of [[police]] and [[security]] which views the contemporary security-industrial complex as both an organizing and systematic war strategy targeting [[Sovereign state|domestic]] and [[foreign policy|foreign]] enemies while simultaneously acting as a process that actively fabricates a [[social order]] conducive to [[capitalist accumulation]]. According to its academic proponents, such an approach to police and security reveals inherent [[Class conflict|class war]] dimensions that have been reinforced by police intellectuals since at least the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ozcan, Gulden and George S. Rigakos. 2014. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog621/full "Pacification"] The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization&lt;/ref&gt;

At base, pacification reflects the need to fabricate productive territories and subjects conducive to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;George S. Rigakos, John L. McMullan, Joshua Johnson &amp; Gülden Ozcan, Eds. 2009. [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/general-police-system-political-economy-security-age-enlightenment/ A General Police System: Political Economy and Security in the Age of Enlightenment].

Socialist Studies / Études socialistes 9 (2) Winter 2013:2&lt;/ref&gt; explain: "The extraction of surplus, as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. 1981. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm Wealth of Nations]. Indianapolis: Liberty Fund.,p.387&lt;/ref&gt; admits, can ‘be squeezed out of [the labourer] by [[violence]] only, and not by any interest of his own’ if he can [[subsist]] otherwise such as through access to [[communal land]]. This, in short, is the foundational [[bourgeois]] logic for the compulsion to pacify."

==Central tenets==
Pacification theory may vary in its use depending on the analyst, but most scholars associated with Anti-security&lt;ref&gt;Manolov, Martin V. and George S. Rigakos. 2014. "[https://www.academia.edu/8020906/Anti-security Anti-security]". The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization&lt;/ref&gt; would likely agree that its central tenets encompass:&lt;ref name="redquillbooks1"&gt;Rigakos, George. ""To Extend the Scope of Productive Labour:" Pacification as a Police Project." [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/anti-security/ Anti-Security]. Eds. Rigakos, George and Mark Neocleous. Ottawa: Red Quill Books, 2011. 57-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# problematizing the objectives of [[security]];  
# building analytic connections instead of masking them;  
# displacing the ubiquity and reach of security; and   
# anticipating a state of war (including [[Class conflict|class war]]) viewing security as an active, unfinished project rife with resistance.
Associated with this last point and serving an essential component of pacification is its immediate connection to making subjects economically "[[Productive and unproductive labour|productive]]" both historically within the plans of [[military]] and [[colonialism|colonial]] overseers and by contemporary police actions, both domestic and international. Neocleous has characterized this process as making war through peace:&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2010. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593571/War_as_Peace_Peace_as_Pacification War as Peace, Peace as Pacification].” Radical Philosophy 159, pp. 8-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A final element of pacification invoked by scholars in this field of study is its connection to the apparent primacy of security thinking and planning in a [[capitalist economy]].  This pronouncement is often linked to [[Karl Marx]]'s assertion that "security is the supreme concept of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society" in the [[Jewish Question]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. 1844. On the Jewish Question. https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/&lt;/ref&gt;  A connection believed to be so embedded that Rigakos has argued that "security ''is'' hegemony".&lt;ref name="redquillbooks1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="academia9"&gt;Manolov, Martin V.

Rigakos],” The Annual Review of Interdisciplinary Justice Research, vol. 3, pp. 9-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The development of '''pacification theory''' is a re-appropriation of the historical usage of the term.  It is offered as an alternative to [[security]] as part of a broader analytic [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/anti-security/ Anti-security] project.&lt;ref name="academia9"/&gt; The development of pacification theory to re-cast security is believed to help radical scholars grasp the inherent objectives and operation of [[security]] politics since [[the Enlightenment]], and is intended to give [[activists]] a ground to stand against the [[securitization]] of political discourse that increasingly surrounds the policing of [[dissent]] in the [[post-9/11]] period.

During the social uprisings in the 1960s in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] against the [[Vietnam War]], pacification came to connote [[bombing]] people into submission and waging an [[ideological]] war against the opposition. However, after the Vietnam War, pacification was dropped from the official [[discourse]] as well as from the discourse of opposition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2008. [http://www.mqup.ca/critique-of-security-products-9780773534810.php Critique of Security]. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although approach towards the term and practices of pacification both in the concept’s sixteenth-century and twentieth-century [[Colonialism and Colonies|colonial]] meanings were somehow related to the concepts of [[war]], [[security]] and police power, the real connection between pacification and these concepts has never been revealed in the literature on [[international relations]], [[conflict studies]], [[criminology]] or [[political science]]. Neocleous&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2007. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593467/Security_Liberty_and_the_Myth_of_Balance Security, Liberty and the Myth of Balance: Towards a Critique of Security Politics.]” Contemporary Political Theory 6, pp. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that the connection between pacification and the ideological discourse on security is related to the terms use in broader [[Western philosophy|Western]] social and [[political thought]] in general, and [[liberal theory]] in particular. In short, that [[liberalism]]’s key concept is less [[liberty]] and more security and that liberal [[doctrine]] is inherently less committed to [[peace]] and far more to legitimizing [[violence]].

In [https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration Anti-security: A Declaration], Neocleous and Rigakos&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark and George S. Rigakos. 2011. “[https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration Anti-security: A Declaration]”, pp. 15-21 in Anti-security. Ottawa: Red Quill Books., p.16&lt;/ref&gt; provocatively summed this argument in the following way: "In the works of the founders of the [[Liberal democracy|liberal]] tradition - that is, the founders of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ideology - liberty is security and security is liberty. For the [[ruling class]], security always has and always will triumph over liberty because ‘liberty’ has never been intended as a counter-weight to security. Liberty has always been security’s [[lawyer]]."

From the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century onwards, the growth of towns in [[Europe]] generated a concern over “masterlesse men,” as [[Thomas Hobbes]] puts it, and their forms of behaviour exposed in [[urban area|urban]] life such as [[gambling]], [[drinking]], [[adultery]], [[blasphemy]] and wandering.&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2011. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593846/A_Brighter_and_Nice_New_Life_Security_as_Pacification ‘A Brighter and Nicer New Life’: Security as Pacification.]” Social and Legal Studies 20(2), pp. 191-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacification, then, functions as a thread that connects sixteenth-century European [[colonialism]] and the fabrication of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[social order]] in eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the US project in Vietnam and contemporary military exercises of [[Empire]] both throughout the globe and domestically.

==General theory==
In [http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9781474413664.html Security/Capital],&lt;ref&gt;Rigakos, George S. 2016. ''Security/Capital: A General Theory of Pacification'' University of Edinburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rigakos offers a General Theory of Pacification.  He argues that pacification is composed of three overlapping strata: (1) Dispossession; (2) [[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]] and (3) [[Commodification]].  Commodification is itself composed of three processes: (a) [[valorization]]; (b) prudentialization; and (c) [[fetishization]]. According to Rigakos, while different in their strategic targets of intervention, each of these three strata of pacification in their aggregate nonetheless both produce and rely on:
{{Quote box
 | quote  = "(1) the use and/ or threat of use of [[violence]]; (2) the legal, institutional, and police subversion and suppression of non-capitalist forms of subsistence and exchange; (3) the circulation of a “[[moral education]]” aimed at ideologically reinforcing capitalist exchange, the wage-labor system, and bourgeois practices and norms among workers, and, finally (4) establishing an institutional and ideological ethic of security that equates threats to any of these aspects as threats to the state of security and the private property relations it supports."
 | source = From: George Rigakos. 2016. [http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9781474413664.html Security/Capital: A General Theory of Pacification]. Edinburgh University Press, p.27
 | width = 100%
 | align = left
}}
The aggregate effect of this theory is the conclusion that the global economic system is now conditioned by pacification as it never has been before.  Rigakos suggests that "the security–
industrial complex is, materially and ideologically, the blast furnace of global capitalism, fuelling both the conditions for the system’s perpetuation while feeding relentlessly on the surpluses it has exacted."&lt;ref&gt;Rigakos, Security/Capital, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriarchalism''' is a political theory that arose in [[England]] in the seventeenth century that defended the concept of absolute power for the monarchy, through language that emphasized the "paternal" power of the king over the state and his subjects.&lt;ref name="Gordon Schochet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Patriarchalism in political thought: the authoritarian family and political speculation and attitudes, especially in seventeenth-century England|first=Gordon|last=Schochet|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Patriarchalism_in_political_thought.html?id=HKEgAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|pages=|year=1975}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to divisive religious policy, controversial political strategy at home and disastrous diplomatic campaigns abroad, James I and Charles I alienated the consensus
of the people. Hence the patriots played down the leading role of the sovereign. They
questioned the royal prerogative, seeing the king as the mere figurehead of England. The king's absolute authority was challenged by the authority of Parliament.

Against this increasing opposition, the Patriarchalists emphasized the absolute right of the king, as the paternal head of state. In ''Patriarcha'' (composed in the late 1620s), [[Robert Filmer|Sir Robert Filmer]] said "many out of an imaginary fear
pretend the power of the people to be necessary for the repressing of the insolencies of tyrants, herein they propound a remedy far worse than the disease"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Filmer|title=Patriarcha, in Patriarcha and Other Political Writings|editor=J P Sommerville|publisher=Cambridge|year=1991|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmer used genealogy as a way to legitimize kingship, by tracing the throne's origins back to the original fatherly rule of Adam.

Filmer argued that the king ''is'' the father; the relationship is not one of similarity, but of identity, the right of fathers having been passed down genealogically since Adam.

Stating that the ideal relationship was between a father and his son to indicate the "mutuall trust and Confidence" which was always necessary in the State, Kynaston put forward the view that the inferior (the people) ought not to plot against the superior (the king).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kynaston|first=F|title=A True Presentation of forepast Parliaments to the viewe of present tymes and Posteritie|publisher=British Library, Lansdowne|pages=167a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Mocket maintained that the maxim “Honor thy Father, and thy Mother” pertained to the political sphere rather than to the familial one since it had more to do with political obedience than with submission within the household&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.ceu.hu/conferences/graceh/abstracts/cuttica_cesare.pdf|title="Adam and the king": the fatherly image of the State.

'''Perfectionist liberalism''' has been defined by [[Charles Larmore]] (1987) as the "family of views that base political principles on 'ideals claiming to shape our overall conception of the good life, and not just our role as citizens.'"&lt;ref name="MN"&gt;Nussbaum, M. C. (2011), "Perfectionist Liberalism and Political Liberalism." ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 39: 3–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CL87"&gt;Larmore, Charles (1987), ''Patterns of Moral Complexity'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larmore, Charles (1996), ''The Morals of Modernity'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Raz]] popularised those ideas. Other important contemporary theorists of liberal perfectionism are [[George Sher]] and [[Steven Wall]]. One can also find liberal perfectionist strands of thought in the writings of early liberals like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Thomas Hill Green|T.H.Green]].

Perfectionist liberalism (or liberal perfectionism - most, though not all authors use these terms synonymously) is the combination of two ideas: [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|Perfectionism]] and [[Liberalism]]. What makes perfectionist liberalism perfectionist is its embracement of an objective theory of the good life (or of human [[Well-being|well-being]]) and the belief that it is the business of the state to (sometimes) promote the good life of its citizens or (if a cosmopolitanist theory of [[Justice|justice]] is correct) to promote the good life of all human beings. What makes perfectionist liberalism liberal is that it either holds a theory of the good life that gives pride of place to the value of [[Autonomy|autonomy]] or that it holds a theory of the good life from which classical liberal rights and/or the principle of state neutrality can be derived (contingently, yet over a wide range of "close" [[Possible world|possible worlds]]), or both.

Often perfectionism is associated with [[Paternalism|paternalism]]. If the state is to promote the well-being of its citizens, so the reasoning, it also has to intervene with citizen's actions that are not conducive to their well-being. Most perfectionist liberals try to avoid this implication by showing that paternalist state action is self-defeating, i.e. they try to show that the best way for the state to promote the well-being of its citizens is to restraint itself and let each individual to strive for her good by herself. Others bite the bullet and hold that liberalism is compatible with some amount of paternalism.

Among political philosophers it is commonplace that perfectionist liberals derive political principles (that guide political action and the design of political institutions) from a theory of the good life. What is often missed is that a theory of political action is not derivable from a theory of the good life alone. Principles can only be derived from other principles. It is therefore of critical importance that liberal perfectionists commit themselves not only to a theory of the good life but also to a theory of [[Distributive justice|distributive justice]]. [[Utilitarianism]], [[Egalitarianism]], [[Sufficientarianism]] and [[Prioritarianism]] are the standard candidates when it comes to principles of distribution.
 
For Raz, at the centre of his perfectionist liberalism are ''autonomy'' and ''moral pluralism'' and the approach can be contrasted with ''political liberalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, Joseph (1987), "Autonomy, Toleration, and the Harm Principle", in ''Issues in Contemporary Legal Philosophy'', edited by Ruth Gavison, Oxford University Press, pp. 313–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]] (2011) notes that elsewhere Larmore (1997) argues that "these views involve controversial ideals of the good life, or views about 'the ultimate nature of the human good.'"

For Nussbaum, ''perfectionist liberalism'' "is a species of a genus of liberal views that might be called “comprehensive liberalisms”" as opposed to "political" or "[[Public reason|public]]" liberalisms. All perfectionist liberalisms are therefore comprehensive while not all comprehensive liberalisms are perfectionist. An eminent case of a comprehensive, yet non-perfectionist liberal theory is Lockean [[Libertarianism|libertarianism]], which is build on the ideal of self-ownership rather than on a conception of the good life. For Nussbaum "liberalisms that base political principles on some comprehensive doctrine about human life" cover "not only the political domain but also the domain of human conduct generally."&lt;ref name="MN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CL87"/&gt;. Furthermore, they depart from non-comprehensive (i.e. political or public reason) liberalism in grounding their political principles in a theory of the good (life), while the latter takes an allegedly "neutral" stance which is supposed to be compatible with all kinds of (reasonable) theories of the good (life).

The term was coined by Iranian political sociologist [[Asef Bayat]], then associate professor of sociology at [[The American University in Cairo]] in a 1996 essay published in the journal ''[[Middle East Critique]]''.{{sfn|Mojahedi|2016|page=52}}{{sfn|Badamchi|2017|page=1}}

Bayat explained it as "a condition where, following a phase of experimentation, the appeal, energy, symbols and sources of legitimacy of [[Islamism]] get exhausted, even among its once-ardent supporters. As such, post-Islamism is not anti-Islamic, but rather reflects a tendency to resecularize religion." It originally pertained only to [[Iran]], where "post-Islamism is expressed in the idea of fusion between Islam (as a personalized faith) and individual freedom and choice; and post-Islamism is associated with the values of [[democracy]] and aspects of [[modernity]]".{{sfn|Bayat|1996|page=45}} In this context, the prefix ''post-'' does not have historic connotation, but refers to the critical departure from [[Islamist]] discourse.{{sfn|Badamchi|2017|page=4}} Bayat later pointed in 2007 that post-Islamism is both a "condition" and a "[[project]]".{{sfn|Gómez García|2012}}

"[[Postmodern]] Islamism" and "[[New Age]] Islamism" are other terms interchangeably used.{{sfn|Ismail|2008|page=626}}

French politician [[Olivier Carré]] used the term in 1991 from a different perspective, to describe the period between the [[10th century|10th]] and the [[19th century|19th]] centuries, when both Shiite and Sunni Islam "separated the [[Civil–military relations|political-military]] from the religious realm, both theoretically and in practice".{{sfn|Gómez García|2012}}

== Cases ==
In [[Iran]], the [[Iranian Reformists|Reformists]]{{sfn|Fazeli|2006|page=169}}{{sfn|Badamchi|2017|page=3}} and the group known as the ''[[Council of Nationalist-Religious Activists of Iran|Melli-Mazhabi]]'' (who are ideologically close to the [[Freedom Movement of Iran|Freedom Movement]]){{sfn|Shahibzadeh|2016|page=103}} are described as post-Islamists.

The advent of moderate parties [[Al-Wasat Party]] in [[Egypt]], as well as [[Justice and Development Party (Morocco)|Justice and Development Party]] in [[Morocco]] appeared to resemble emergance of post-Islamism, however scholars rejected that they qualify as such.{{sfn|Stacher|2002|page=432}}{{sfn|Lauzi`ere|2005|page=242}} A similar characterization applies to the [[Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS)]].{{sfn|Muller|2013}}

A 2008 [[Lowy Institute for International Policy]] paper suggests that [[Prosperous Justice Party]] of [[Indonesia]] and [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) of [[Turkey]] are post-Islamist.{{sfn|Bubalo|Fealy|Mason|2002|page=51, 76}} According to Ahmet T. Kuru and [[Alfred Stepan]] (2012), many analysts consider Turkish AKP an example of post-Islamism, similar to [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, but Islamic.{{sfn|Kuru|Stepan|2012|page=172}} However, some scholars such as [[Bassam Tibi]] dispute this.{{sfn|Hale|Ozbudun|2009|page=148}} İhsan Yılmaz argues that the party's ideology after 2011 is different from that of between 2001 and 2011.{{sfn|Yılmaz|2016|page=115}}

The idea has been used to describe the "ideological evolution" within the [[Ennahda Movement|Ennahda]] of [[Tunisia]].{{sfn|Cavatorta|Merone|2015}}

'''Post-politics''' refers to the critique of the [[emergence]], in the post-[[Cold War]] period, of a politics of [[consensus]] on a global scale: the dissolution of the [[Communist bloc|Eastern Communist bloc]] following the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]] instituted a promise for post-ideological consensus. The political development in post-communist countries went two different directions depending on the approach each of them take on dealing with the communist party members. Active [[decommunisation]] process took place in Eastern European states which later joined EU. While in Russia and majority of former USSR republics communists became one of many political parties on equal grounds.

Generated by a cohort of radical philosophers – namely [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Alain Badiou]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]] – and their concern with politics as the institution of radical, active equality, this critique claims that the post-ideological politics of consensus has occasioned the systematic foreclosure of the properly political moment: with the institution of a series of new “[[Post-democracy|post-democratic]]" governmental techniques, internal politics proper is reduced to social administration.  Meanwhile, with the rise of the postmodernist "politics of self" comes a concomitant new "politics of conduct", in which political values are replaced by moral ones (what [[Chantal Mouffe]] terms "politics in the register of morality").

== Roots of the post-political consensus ==
=== The global political landscape post-1989 ===
The disintegration of the Eastern communist bloc following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 announced the end of the Cold War era, and with it the great ideological stand-off between East and West, between the communist and capitalist worlds.  In eyes of Western society Capitalism emerged the victor with liberal democracy as its corresponding political doctrine.  With the fall of state-communism in Eastern Europe and Eurasia as the final blow to an already crisis-ridden system, the USSR as a key political player on side of communism abandoned its [[social democratic]], [[Keynesian]] form; and neoliberalism entered a new global phase. In the USSR the main driver for this change was idea of "convergention" between socialism and communism formulated by [[Andrej Sakharov]] in his Nobel price speech. With [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s [[End of History and the Last Man|End of History]] as its founding statement, this was the birth of the post-political, post-ideological "[[Zeitgeist]]".

=== Intellectual climate ===
Alongside Fukuyama, various other intellectual currents are associated with the consolidation of the post-political consensus.  The "[[reflexive modernity]]" thesis of post-industrial sociologists [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Ulrich Beck]], for example, has acted as the intellectual accompaniment to Third Way politics.  In "reflexive modernity", say these authors, the central imperative of political action shifts from issues of social welfare (a politics of redistribution) to the management of "risk" (a politics of "distributive responsibility"): that is, the "environmental externalities" that are the ever more visible, unwanted by-products of techno-economic progress.  For both Beck and Giddens it is this imperative, and the new "social reflexivity" that has developed in response – rather than instrumental rationality or, crucially, political struggle – that has driven the profound [[social change]]s of the post-war period.  Indeed, for Giddens, it is "social reflexivity" – the enhanced autonomy of individual action called forth by the dispersal of socio-technological knowledge and risk in "post-traditional" society – that paves the way for:
# post-Fordist production (based as it is on flexible production and bottom-up decision-making);
# the reconfiguration of society’s relation to authority (political, expert and administrative, both within the state and beyond) according to the principles of deliberation and “active trust”.
According to both Beck and Giddens, these changes render obsolete material, class-based, ideologically grounded politics organised via traditional, collective forms such as the party or trade union.  In their place, we see the emergence of a new “politics of self” (“subpolitics” in Beck; “life politics" in Giddens) in which, as part of the wider [[Postmodernity|post-modern]] turn, issues previously considered to be purely personal enter the political arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all commentators agree with this version of events, however, and it is the critical perspectives considered in this section from which the post-political critique derives.  Nikolas Rose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Nikolas|title=Community, citizenship, and the third way|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2000|volume=43|pages=1395–1411|doi=10.1177/00027640021955955}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, counters Beck and Giddens by highlighting the role of a new governmental "politics of conduct" in forging the political subjectivities that emerge with the advent of Third Way politics in Britain under New Labour (and, by extension, in developed nations in the post-industrial period).  Against Giddens' "social reflexivity"-based account, Rose's study of this new "ethopolitics" suggests that it is the strictures of the new, market individualist (Schumpeterian) forms of governance-beyond-the-state that has driven the recent emphasis on the autonomous, freedom-aspiring, self-sufficient individual.  A key feature of "ethopolitics", says Rose, is its concern with the ethical, rather than political sensibilities of its subjects; a trend wholly consistent with the moralistic turn that politics took on under neoliberalism.  Indeed, in his work on the decline of the public sector in Britain, David Marquand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marquand|first=David|title=Decline of the public|year=2004|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the moral ideology that – via the wider "revenge of the private" – underpinned the neoliberal reforms and sell-offs imposed on the sector by the Thatcher and Blair governments.  This is a key development to which the post-political critique responds: Mouffe speaks here of “politics played out in the register of morality”; while Rancière’s re-envisioning of the political is an express challenge against the de-politicisation of political philosophy that occurred with the field’s Aristotlean, “ethical” turn in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Oliver|title=Key Contemporary Thinkers: Jacques Ranciere|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, while Beck points to [[environmentalism]] as a paradigm case of the progressive potential of the personalisation of politics, [[Erik Swyngedouw]] reminds us that in the guise in which it most often appears in the developed world, environmentalism's emphasis on personal lifestyle choices and on particularist struggles against the locally felt effects of environmental "bads" can work to draw attention away from the properly political issue of human society's structural relationship with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|author=Swyngedouw, Erik |authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw |editor=Krueger, Rob |editor2=David, Gibbs|pages=13–40(23)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Beck celebrates the new scepticism associated with post-modern, [[Identity politics|identity-based politics]] as a progressive consequence of the universal uncertainty that characterises [[risk society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, critics lament the profound consequences that the anti-essentialist position on truth has had for the imagination of "[[grand narrative]]s" (read political [[Teleology#Modern and postmodern philosophy|teleologies]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Nick|title=Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere: Re-Thinking Emancipation|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – for proponents of the post-political critique, it is these grand narratives that are the real substance of politics.

== The post-political critique ==
Proponents of the post-political critique do not represent a united theoretical body.  Nonetheless, and excepting Mouffe, the philosophers associated with this critique are sometimes treated together, based on:
* the contribution they have made in recent years to the beginnings of a reinvigoration of radical left thought
* their concern with active, radical equality (equality as an axiomatic given, in contrast to formal equality) and with human emancipation
* their broadly [[Materialism|materialist]] bent – while engaging to a greater or lesser degree with [[Marxism]] in their later work, all were influenced by Marxism in their early years.  Additionally, while influenced by it in important ways, all depart substantially from [[post-structuralism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Nick|title=Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere: Re-thinking Emancipation|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
What Rancière, Badiou and Žižek, along with Mouffe, agree upon is that under the present post-political conjuncture we have seen a systematic foreclosure of the "properly political dimension", the reinstitution of which will depend upon a radical re-envisioning of our notion of the political.

Against the widespread resignation to addressing politics solely at the [[ontic]] or empirical level – that is, a concern with the "facts of politics" or with politics as 'the exercise of power or the deciding of common affairs'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt; – this re-envisioning must, they say, concern itself with the [[Ontology|ontological]] dimension of politics: that is, with the essence of the political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While each conceptualises the properly political in different ways, all agree upon its irreducibly and inherently antagonistic dimension:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alain Badiou: Live Theory|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|author=Badiou, A|authorlink=Alain Badiou|editor=Feltham, O.|pages=136–139 (139)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a radical-progressive position must, says Žižek, 'insist on the unconditional primacy of the inherent antagonism as constitutive of the political'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Challenge of Carl Schmitt|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|author=Zizek, Slavoj|authorlink=Slavoj Zizek|editor=Mouffe, Chantal|pages=18–37(29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the charge that post-politics, with consensus as its defining logic, forecloses the properly political.

=== Rancière's account of the political ===
==== Politics versus police ====
Rancière's work reclaims the notion of politics.  For him, the latter does not consist in 'the exercise of power or the deciding of common affairs', as is ordinarily assumed.  Rather, if politics is born out of the fact of sharing a common space and thus common concerns; and if 'every decision on common affairs requires the prior existence of the common', politics proper surely, says Rancière, denotes the inherent antagonism that exists between competing representations of this common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this basis, Rancière's account of the political proceeds via the distinction he draws between this latter notion of politics proper (''le politique'') (as antagonism), and what he terms the police or police order (''la police'').  The fundamental divergence between politics proper and the police, says Rancière, is their respective representations of the common.  The former not only recognises, but also calls forth the contested nature of the common.  Meanwhile, the police:

‘…symbolises the community as an ensemble of well-defined parts, places and functions, and of the properties and capabilities linked to them, all of which presupposes a fixed distribution of things into common and private – a distinction which itself depends on an ordered distribution of the visible and the invisible, noise and speech, etc…This way of counting [parts, places and functions] simultaneously defines the ways of being, doing, and saying appropriate to these places.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense (and although he disagrees with Foucault on some crucial points), Rancière's definition of police is akin to that given to it in [[Michel Foucault]]'s work.

==== ''Le partage du sensible'' (the "partition" or "distribution" of "the perceptible") ====
Rancière's aesthetic conceptualisation of politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Oliver|title=Key Contemporary Thinkers: Jacques Ranciere|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows him to take Foucault's "police" one step further: not only, says Rancière, does the specific allocation of “parts” given in the police order govern ‘the ways of being, doing and saying’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. the behavioural codes 'appropriate to these places'); rather, as the nomination suggests, this particular "partition of the ''perceptible''" also acts to draw, and subsequently police, the very boundaries of what is and is not visible, audible, comprehendible – in short, perceptible – under this order.

This distinctive insight derives in part from Rancière's enquiry into the origins of democracy and in part from the centrality to his theory of the notion of ''mésentente''.  While translated into English simply as "disagreement" (with obvious reference to the constitutively antagonistic element of politics, as discussed above), in French ''mésentente'' also implies, in a speech situation, the fact of misunderstanding between parties, or more precisely in the Rancièrian sense of "talking past one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(5)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rancière's point here is to underline that the fact of misunderstanding is not a neutral one: rather, the partition of the perceptible given in the police order decides whether an enunciation is heard as speech or instead as noise; as rational discourse (as in [[Deliberative democracy|deliberative democratic]] theory, such as that of [[Jürgen Habermas]] or [[John Rawls]]), or instead as a grunt or moan.  In Rancière, the fact of labelling a voice "inaudible" is, therefore, associated with the denial of the subject of that voice as a (political) subject.

==== The contingency of the police order: constitutive excess, the miscount and political subjectivation ====
As suggested above, in so far as the “count” always entails a “miscount” (i.e. denies the subjecthood of certain constituencies), the “logic of the proper”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(175)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which the police order operates is incommensurable with the logic of active, radical equality proposed by Rancière.  Grounded in his account of the usurpatory action that instituted the [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]] as the locus of popular sovereignty in ancient Athens, Rancière defines democracy as 'the specific power of those who have no common title to exercise power, except that of not being entitled to its exercise': 'democracy is the paradoxical power of those who do not count: the count of the unaccounted for’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dissenting Words: A Conversation with Jacques Ranciere|journal=diacritics|year=2000|volume=30|issue=2|pages=113–124(124)|author=Ranciere, Jacques|editor=Panagia, David|doi=10.1353/dia.2000.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The properly and essentially political "sequence" (to borrow a term from Badiou), then, arises in the rare moment in which ''les sans-part'' exercise this title and make their "usurpatory claim"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Oliver|title=Key Contemporary Thinkers: Jacques Ranciere|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a stake in the common: in this moment of “political subjectivation” – that is, the coming into being of a new political subject – the logic of equality meets with and violently unclothes the inegalitarian police logic of the proper; ''les sans-part'', asserting the audibility of their voice and the visibility of their collective body, thus seize their place in the partition of the perceptible and overturn the inaugural “wrong” done to them by a police order whose count left them unaccounted for.

For Rancière, this moment of dramatic ‘rupture in the order of legitimacy and domination’ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dissenting Words: A Conversation with Jacques Ranciere|journal=diacritics|year=2000|volume=30|issue=2|pages=113–124(124)|author=Ranciere, Jacques|editor=Panagia, David|doi=10.1353/dia.2000.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a constant possibility and as such posits the ultimate [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of any given police order.  This assertion is explained by the specific agency lent to ''les sans-part'' by the nature of their relationship to the police.  Rancière is at pains to underline that ''les sans-part'' is not so much a social class or group excluded and thus awaiting incorporation: that would imply not only a procedural account of equality but also the existence of the emergent political subject – as an identity pre-given in the police order – prior to the political moment, both scenarios not worthy of the name politics according to Rancière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(6)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(178)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Les sans-part'' should instead be thought of as a supernumerary category, existing 'at once nowhere and everywhere':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(176)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; '…political subjects are ''supernumerary'' collectives which call into question the counting of the community's parts and the relations of inclusion and exclusion which define that count.  Subjects…''are not reducible'' to social groups or identities but are, rather, collectives of enunciation and demonstration ''surplus'' to the count of social groups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Introducing Disagreement|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|year=2004|volume=9|issue=3|pages=3–9(7)|doi=10.1080/0969725042000307583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is from this conceptualisation that ''les sans-part'' derive their agency: crucially, the police logic of the proper is a logic ‘predicated upon saturation’, upon the assumption that it is possible to designate society as a totality "{{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} groups performing specific functions and occupying determined spaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(606)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the at-once visible/invisible proof of the age-old adage that, contrary to this logic, 'the whole is more than the sum of its parts',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(176)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; the very existence of ''les sans-parts'' as ''excess'' therefore radically negates the police logic of the proper.

==== Excess and the Universal in Rancière, Žižek, Badiou and Mouffe ====
There would seem to be a contradiction that appears in Rancière's schema (outlined above): political subjectivation entails assertion of a place, yet it also negates the very logic of places, of the proper.  Rancière deals with this by specifying that the political moment is called forth only to the extent that the 'part of the no-part' is asserted in such a way that it forms an identification 'with the community as a whole.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten Theses on Politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rancière's claim is that this distinctly universalist gesture works to deny the particularist logic that partitions social space into a series of private, proper places, functions and parts, thus resolving the aforementioned contradiction.  In his account of the (post-)political, Slavoj Žižek also insists heavily on the role of the universal.  For Žižek, a situation becomes political when:

…a particular demand…starts to function as a metaphoric condensation of the global [universal] opposition against Them, those in power, so that the protest is no longer just about that demand, but about the universal dimension that resonates in that particular demand…What post-politics tends to prevent is precisely this metaphoric universalisation of particular demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(204)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of dealing with the aforementioned contradiction, however, Žižek's concept of the "indivisible remainder"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; is somewhat more instructive than his emphasis on the universal.  The figure of the "remainder" of course corresponds closely to that of "excess" or "surplus" in Rancière.  Meanwhile, the notion of "indivisibility" implies a strong resistance to partitioning (perhaps stronger than the universalist gesture upon which Rancière relies).

In this respect, the ontological status of the remainder in Žižek comes closer to that of the privileged figure of Badiou's "non-expressive dialectics": the generic set.  Derived from mathematical [[set theory]], a generic set is the name given by its discoverer [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] to 'the mathematical object without clear description, without name, without place in the classification…[it is] an object the characteristic of which is to have no name'.  It therefore offers the solution to the fundamental problem of politics, which according to Badiou presents itself as follows: if in the battle between the suturing logic of Law (the police) and the emancipatory logic of Desire, Desire must necessarily always be directed at something beyond the ontological universe specified by Law, the crucial problem for political action must be to find ways of naming the object of Desire without prescribing it and thus subsuming it back under the ontological domain of Law, as this would be to negate Desire, and with it the possibility of politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badiou|first=Alain|title=Politics: A Non-expressive Dialectics|url=http://blog.urbanomic.com/sphaleotas/archives/badiou-politics.pdf|work=Is the Politics of Truth still Thinkable? (Conference Title)|accessdate=7 January 2011|location=Birkbeck Institute of Humanities, London|date=26 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; With genericity being closely associated to universality in Badiou's work, the latter therefore contributes a great deal to developing the notion of "surplus" or "excess" in both Rancière and Žižek.  It also points more resolutely than does Rancière to the designation of politics proper as the moment of institution of an entirely new conception of the social totality.  Or, as Žižek puts it: ‘…[A]uthentic politics…is the art of the impossible – it changes the very parameters of what is considered "possible" in the existing constellation';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(199)}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence also, for Žižek, its inherently antagonistic dimension.

The figure of excess fulfils a different purpose in Mouffe's theory of the political, which rests heavily on her and Laclau's notion of [[hegemony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laclau|first=Ernesto|title=[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics]]|year=1985|publisher=Verso|location=London|author2=Mouffe, Chantal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dikec, hegemony in Laclau and Mouffe's image presupposes the impossibility of 'a totally sutured society, or, in other words, a total closure of the social'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dikec|first=Mustafa|title=Space, politics, and the political|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2005|volume=23|pages=171–188(174)|doi=10.1068/d364t}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because hegemony is possible only through antagonism; and antagonism, in turn, can exist only through lack or surplus: consensus, in this view, is never a complete closure; rather, it only ever exists as the ‘temporary result of a provisional hegemony’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=Deliberative Democracy or Agonistic Pluralism?|journal=Social Research|year=1999|volume=66|issue=3|pages=745–758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as it rests on an assertion of the impossibility of saturation, Mouffe's critique of post-politics therefore displays some commonality with those of Rancière, Badiou and Žižek.  Mouffe's resistance to saturation, however, is explained by her [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] politico-theoretical persuasion and its attendant anti-essentialism.  In this respect, her theory of the political differs widely from the above-mentioned philosophers, all of whom, while inspired in various ways by it, are careful to distance themselves from post-structuralist thought, not least on account of the contribution it has in their eyes made to the consolidation of the post-political Zeitgeist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Nick|title=Badiou, Balibar, Ranciere: Re-thinking Emancipation|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|page16-17=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also explains the absence of the universalist gesture in Mouffe.  Indeed, as explained above, the political is the struggle for hegemonic control over the particular content that is to stand-in for the Universal.  An authentic universality is therefore impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171-244(175-182)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saturation and post-politics ====
The present conjuncture is characterised as post-political not insofar as it denies equality: on the contrary in the advanced liberal democracies that are the heartlands of post-politics, formal equality is declared triumphant, leaving only the “perfection” of democracy via more participative, deliberative mechanisms.  Rather, from the philosophical perspective outlined above, post-politics is characterised as such insofar as its insistence on saturation and its denial of excess are particularly strong.  Thus, under the present, liberal democratic conjuncture, the drive towards the democratic inclusion of all has particularly suturing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(202)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(609)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the insistence on the achievement of formal equality is especially ignorant to the fact of "surplus".  Despite the concerted strategies of consensual incorporation or exclusion directed at it, the persistence of "surplus" is clearly evidenced in the present period: firstly in the deepening of real-world, material inequalities and secondly in those properly political gestures that resist the conditional nature of (post-)democratic participation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John|title=Markets, Deliberation and Environment|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, that resist accession to the post-political consensus.

== Post-politics and the environment ==
As both Žižek and Badiou explicitly recognise, the post-political scenario is particularly well-advanced in the ecological sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=Against the Populist Temptation|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alain Badiou: Live Theory|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|author=Badiou, A|authorlink=Alain Badiou|editor=Feltham, O.|pages=136–139 (139)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this cue, environmental geographer [[Erik Swyngedouw]] has led an emerging literature that identifies within environmental politics many of the classic symptoms of the post-political condition.

=== Symptoms of the post-political condition exemplified in environmental politics ===
==== Post-ideological consensus ====
As noted above, the post-political configuration is characterised by the disciplining role of consensus.  With the market and the liberal state as it organising principles, the present global "meta-level" consensus has taken cosmopolitanism and humanitarianism as the central and uncontestable tenets of its corresponding moral (rather than political) value system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(609)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearly twenty years since the [[Rio Earth Summit]] (1992), [[sustainability]] has not only established itself as an additional tenet of this moral order.  In so doing, it has also stepped in as one of the primary post-ideological "ideologies" of the present age: as Swyngedouw notes, as a concept sustainability is so devoid of properly political content that it is impossible to disagree with its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|pages=13–40(20) |authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw |editor=Krueger, R. |editor2=Gibbs, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swyngedouw's analysis of the particular representation of nature called forth by sustainability discourse explains why this is so.  He argues that the nature that enters political debate via sustainability discourse is a radically conservative and reactionary one that posits a singular, ontologically stable and harmonious Nature thrown "out of synch" by human intervention.  In denying the plurality, complexity and unpredictability of actually existing natures, sustainability "codes" nature in such a way as to pose status quo (read market-based) solutions that side-step debate over the properly political question of what kind of socio-environmental futures we wish to inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|pages=13-40(20-23)|authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw|editor=Krueger, R. |editor2=Gibbs, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Managerialism and technocracy ====
{{main|Technocracy}}

The post-political condition is characterised by the rise of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(204)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certainly exercised in a democratic fashion (i.e. via the deliberative engagement described by Giddens' social reflexivity thesis (see above)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|title=On the political|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;), expert adjudication nonetheless comes to substitute properly political debate.

This trend is particularly visible in the environmental sphere.  According to Gert Goeminne and Karen François,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goeminne|first=Gert|author2=Francois, Karen|title=The Thing Called Environment: What It Is and How to Be Concerned With It|journal=The Oxford Literary Review|year=2010|volume=32|issue=1|pages=109–130|doi=10.3366/olr.2010.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; more concerning still than the increasing "colonisation" of this sphere by science is that it is a radically depoliticised version of science that is doing the colonising.  Drawing heavily from [[Bruno Latour]], Goeminne and François' work serves to problematise the representational work done by science: science is neither a neutral conductor of material reality that produces “facts”, nor should its legitimacy to speak on behalf of nature escape scrutiny.  By contrast, ‘…the fact-value divide of the Modern Constitution acts to obscure the work of composition that goes into the construction of a matter of fact’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goeminne|first=Gert|title=Climate Policy is Dead, Long Live Climate Politics!|journal=Ethics, Place and Environment|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=207–214(212)|doi=10.1080/13668791003778867}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus giving way to the post-political configuration, in which politics is reduced to 'the administration and management of processes whose parameters are defined by consensual socio-scientific knowledges'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(602)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In environmental politics, then, 'disagreement is allowed, but only with respect to the choice of technologies, the mix of organisational fixes, the details of the managerial adjustments, and the urgency of the timing and implementation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Sustainable Development Paradox: Urban Political Economy in the United States and Europe|year=2007|publisher=Guildford Press|location=London|pages=13–40(23) |authorlink=Erik Swyngedouw |editor=Krueger, R. |editor2=Gibbs, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding global climate adaptation and mitigation, that debate over climate scientists' varying interpretations of crucial [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]] diverts attention from questions of "[[climate justice]]" is a case in point.

The [[Technocracy|technocratic]], "post-democratic" tendency ushered in with the neoliberal transition towards governance-beyond-the-state (henceforth [[governance]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=Governance Innovation and the Citizen: The Janus Face of Governance-beyond-the-State|journal=Urban Studies|year=2005|volume=42|issue=11|pages=1991–2006|doi=10.1080/00420980500279869}}&lt;/ref&gt; has therefore been reinforced by consensus politics.  And as the environmental sphere has been a particularly privileged site for experimentation in neoliberal governance, so too is it particularly vulnerable to the post-political tendency.  The neoliberal shift in environmental policy implementation was signalled in the 1990s by the growing influence of [[New Public Management]] (NPM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. A. W|title=The New Governance: Governing without Government|journal=Political Studies|year=1996|volume=XLIV|pages=652–667|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb01747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing preference for [[new environmental policy instruments]] (NEPIs).  Meanwhile, one need only point to the predominance of quantitative measures such as [[Cost Benefit Analysis]] (CBA) or the vast regulatory apparatuses associated with the new and burgeoning carbon markets as evidence of what Mitchell Dean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Mitchell|title=Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society|year=1999|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; has labelled "post-democratic" concern with metricisation, accountancy, auditing and benchmarking.

Alongside this latter concern, Dean, along with Barbara Cruikshank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cruikshank|first=Barbara|title=Revolutions within: self-governance and self-esteem|journal=Economy and Society|year=1993|volume=22|issue=3|pages=327–344|doi=10.1080/03085149300000022}}&lt;/ref&gt; also associates the "post-democratic" turn with a series of new "technologies of citizenship".  As forms of [[biopower]], these latter work to increasingly displace 'regulatory competence'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemke|first=T.|title=Foucault, governmentality and critique|journal=Rethinking Marxism|year=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=49–64|doi=10.1080/089356902101242288}}&lt;/ref&gt; onto the morally responsible, autonomous subject that the state increasingly seeks to forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=Governance Innovation and the Citizen: The Janus Face of Governance-beyond-the-State|journal=Urban Studies|year=2005|volume=42|issue=11|pages=1991–2006|doi=10.1080/00420980500279869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Nikolas|title=Community, citizenship, and the third way|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2000|volume=43|pages=1395–1411|doi=10.1177/00027640021955955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Politics as the negotiation of particular interests ====
As both Žižek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|pages=171–244(204)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rancière&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten Theses on Politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue, under post-politics the political claims of particular groups are denied their potentially universal character.  Oosterlynk and Swyngedouw's application of the post-political critique to the dispute over [[noise pollution]] associated with Brussels airport is a classic example: the geographically differentiated impact of noise pollution was used to pit residents’ associations against one another, precluding the potential that a universal claim against the global [[Just in time (business)|"just-in-time"]] economy (the ultimate source of increased flights) be articulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oosterlynck|first=Stijn|title=Noise reduction: the postpolitical quandary of night flights at Brussels airport|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2010|volume=42|pages=1577–1594|doi=10.1068/a42269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Populism and the resurgence of the properly political ====
[[Populism]], as the residue of the properly political, is the ultimate symptom of the post-political condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601–20(611)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the post-political consensus itself tends towards populist gestures as a substitute for the properly political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601-20(611-613)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, popular frustration with the confines of consensual politics inevitably gives way to alternatives that, faced with the depoliticising strategies of the consensual order, often take a populist form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=Against the Populist Temptation|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most characteristic features of populism is its invocation of a common, external threat or enemy.  The homogenising, unifying effect of this invocation is what produces the mythical – but more importantly reactionary and invariably exclusionary –  notion of "the people" that is so central to the populist gesture.  Swyngedouw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=The Antinomies of the Postpolitical: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Protection|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=601-20(611-613)|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that in climate politics "the people" becomes a united "humanity" facing a common predicament, regardless of the differentiated responsibility for and capacity to respond to anthropogenic climate change.  Following other scholars who have analysed the alarmist tone of climate discourse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamblyn|first=R.|title=The whistleblower and the canary: rhetorical constructions of climate change|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|year=2009|volume=35|pages=223–236|doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2008.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skrimshire|first=Stefan|title=Future ethics: climate change and apocalyptic imagination|year=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swyngedouw also underlines that the millenarian, apocalyptic imaginaries called forth by the latter create an external threat, while also giving way to an elite-led, almost crusade-like action (the latter being a further classic feature of populism).  The environmental consensus therefore entails a populist dimension.

Meanwhile, as Žižek has shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|title=Against the Populist Temptation|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; disaffection with the consensus tends to favour Far Right movements, whose populist tactics respond to the same need to substitute the properly political described above; and whose violent gestures mimic the properly political impetus towards antagonism.  On the other hand, properly political claims that resist both consensual strategies of incorporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John|title=Markets, Deliberation and Environment|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what Žižek has called "the populist temptation" are made audible only as violent or fanatical outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranciere|first=Jacques|title=Ten Theses on Politics|journal=Theory and Event|year=2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1353/tae.2001.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the environmental arena, media coverage of "resource wars" is a prime example of disputes that may well have a properly political dimension (though may not, of course, necessarily be progressive or without populist dimensions, of course) being neutralised in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swyngedouw|first=Erik|title=Apocalypse Forever|journal=Theory, Culture and Society|year=2010|volume=27|issue=2-3|pages=213–232|doi=10.1177/0263276409358728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Progressive Party of 1948''' was a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[political party]] that served as a vehicle for former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s 1948 presidential campaign. The party sought desegregation, the establishment of a national health insurance system, an expansion of the welfare system, and the nationalization of the energy industry. The party also sought conciliation with the [[Soviet Union]] during the early stages of the [[Cold War]].

Wallace had served as vice president under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] but was dumped from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket in 1944. After the end of [[World War II]], Wallace emerged as a prominent critic of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s Cold War policies. Wallace's supporters held the [[1948 Progressive National Convention]], which nominated a ticket consisting of Wallace and Democratic Senator [[Glen H. Taylor]] of [[Idaho]]. Despite challenges from Wallace, Republican nominee [[Thomas E. Dewey]], and [[Strom Thurmond]] of the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] [[Dixiecrat]]s, Truman won re-election in the 1948 election. Wallace won 2.4% of the vote, which was far less than the share received by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], the presidential candidates of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|1912]] and [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|1924 Progressive Party]] tickets, respectively. Neither of those parties were directly related to Wallace's party, though these parties did carry over ideological groups and influenced many members of the 1948 Progressive Party.

After the election, Wallace recanted his foreign policy views and became estranged from his former supporters. The party nominated attorney [[Vincent Hallinan]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], and Hallinan won 0.2% of the national popular vote. The party began to disband in 1955 as opponents of [[Anti-communism|anti-Communism]] became increasingly unpopular, and was mostly fully dissolved by the late 1960s with the exception of a few affiliated state Progressive Parties.

The Progressive Party of Henry Wallace was, and remains, controversial due to the issue of [[Communism|communist influence]]. The party served as a safe haven for communists, [[fellow travelers]], and anti-war [[Modern American liberalism|liberals]] during the [[Red Scare|Second Red Scare]]. Prominent Progressive Party supporters included U.S. Representative [[Vito Marcantonio]] and writer [[Norman Mailer]].&lt;ref name="A Double Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=Michael|title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life|date=2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781439150191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

The formation of the Progressive Party began in 1946, after [[Secretary of Commerce]] and former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] quit the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]] and began to publicly agitate against Truman's policies. Calls for a [[Third party (politics)|third party]] had been growing even before Wallace, who was replaced as vice president by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] with the more conservative Truman at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]],  left the Truman Administration. One of the ironies of the contest between Wallace and Truman was that, if FDR had not [[Democratic vice presidential nomination of 1944|replaced Wallace with Truman]] at the 1944 Democratic convention—at the behest of Democratic Party bosses who felt that Wallace was too liberal and too erratic—Wallace would have been President of the United States, not Truman.

Wallace disliked the hard line that Truman had taken against the [[Soviet Union]], a stance that won him favor among liberals and [[fellow travelers]] who were opposed to what became known as the [[Cold War]]. He received support from two major organizations, the National Citizens Political Action Committee (NCPAC) and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP), [[political action committees]] (PACs) that had been created to support FDR.&lt;ref name="digital.lib.uiowa.edu"&gt;

In her 1954 book ''School of Darkness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Bella|title=School of Darkness|date=1954|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.com/School-Darkness-B-V-Dodd/dp/0815968043|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bella Dodd]], a Communist Party US National Committee member who later left and went on to give anti-Communist testimony before Congress, wrote about a June 1947 Communist National Committee meeting she attended at which the founding of the 1948 Progressive Party was planned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of it all came near the end, when [[John Gates|[John] Gates]] read that a third party would be very effective in 1948, but only if we could get Henry Wallace to be its candidate.

There it was, plainly stated. The Communists were proposing a third party, a farmer-labor party, as a political maneuver for the 1948 elections. They were even picking the candidate.

When Gates had finished, I took the floor. I said that while I would not rule out the possibility of building a farmer-labor party, surely the decision to place a third party in 1948 should be based not on whether Henry Wallace would run, but on whether a third party would help meet the needs of workers and farmers in America. And if a third party were to participate in the 1948 elections, the decision should be made immediately by bona-fide labor and farmer groups, and not delayed until some secret and unknown persons made the decision.

My remarks were heard in icy silence. When I had finished, the committee with no answer to my objection simply went on to other work.

However, it was becoming evident that the top clique was having a hard time with this proposition. It was also clear that [[Eugene Dennis|[Eugene] Dennis]] and his clique of smart boys were reserving to themselves the right to make the final decision, and that the Party in general was being kept pretty much in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Bella|title=School of Darkness|date=1954|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|location=New York|pages=203–204|url=https://www.amazon.com/School-Darkness-B-V-Dodd/dp/0815968043|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Communist influence==

In February 1948, two days before a special election put American Labor Party candidate [[Leo Isacson]] into Congress, the ''New York Times'' analyzed the shifting background of the Progressive Party:   &lt;blockquote&gt; The question involved in the special election is how strongly the Labor [ALP] party vote will hold up after withdrawal of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] and other [[anti-Communist]] unions from the Labor party because of its support of Mr. Wallace's candidacy for President, which has left the [[Communist Party of the USA|Communists]] and other left-wing elements in complete control of that party's organization.&lt;ref name=Test&gt;

Dewey had defeated the isolationist, non-interventionist [[Robert A. Taft]] for the GOP nomination and favored an aggressive policy against the USSR.

The [[Communist Party USA]] did not field a presidential candidate, and instead endorsed Wallace for President; given that the [[Cold War]] was beginning to gain momentum and with it the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] and anti-Communist sentiment. This endorsement was to hinder Wallace far more than it would help him. Wallace had served [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], Vice President, and [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]. He was fired by President [[Harry S. Truman]] because he denounced Truman's foreign policy regarding the Cold War. When Wallace refused to expel Communists working in the party during the 1948 election, his campaign was severely criticized by both the rigidly anti-Communist Truman and [[Thomas E. Dewey|Dewey]] camps.

The former Communist National Committee member [[Bella Dodd]] asserts in her 1954 memoir ''School of Darkness'' that the Progressive Party of 1948 had Wallace as its voice and "inspirational leader" but was really controlled by top U.S. Communists, particularly [[William Z. Foster]] and [[Eugene Dennis]], who filled the staff of the new party with people loyal to themselves and dictated self-defeating policies to the Progressive Party. Dodd concluded:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The reason they wanted a small limited Progressive Party was because it was the only kind they could control. They wanted to control it because they wanted a political substitute for the Communist Party, which they expected would soon be made illegal. A limited and controlled Progressive Party would be a cover organization and a substitute for the Communist Party if the latter were outlawed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Bella|title=School of Darkness|date=1954|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|location=New York|page=205|url=https://www.amazon.com/School-Darkness-B-V-Dodd/dp/0815968043|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;     Historians have disputed the degree to which Communists shaped the party. Most agree that Wallace himself was not a Communist, but they also agree that he paid very little attention to internal party affairs.  Historians Schapsmeier and Schapsmeier argue &lt;!-- Wrong citation style --&gt;(1970 p 181):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The Progressive Party] stood for one thing and Wallace another. Actually the party organization was controlled from the outset by those representing the radical left and not liberalism per se. This made it extremely easy for Communists and fellow travelers to infiltrate into important positions within the party machinery. Once this happened, party stands began to resemble a party line. Campaign literature, speech materials, and campaign slogans sounded strangely like echoes of what Moscow wanted to hear. As if wearing moral blinkers, Wallace increasingly became an imperceptive ideologue. Words were uttered by Wallace that did not sound like him, and his performance took on a strange Jekyll and Hyde quality—one moment he was a peace protagonist and the next a propaganda parrot for the Kremlin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One historian (further to the left than the Schapsmeiers) explores the internal dynamic (Schmidt 258-9):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* At one pole were the extreme leftists, three closely related groups—admitted Communists, past and present; the party-liners and fellow travelers who failed to differ noticeably with the Communists as to either policy or principle; and finally those non-Communists who, in …  1944-50 failed to take issue with the Communists on policy, but whose underlying principles seemingly differed….
* In the middle were grouped an apparently large majority of Progressive Party followers—the moderates. Exemplified by both national candidates, these individuals were willing to accept Communist support, because they felt that it was inconsistent, in the light of their ideals, to oppose Redbaiting by others, yet attempt to read Communists out of the new party.
* At the right were arrayed those who, feeling that Communist support should have been disavowed in no uncertain terms, yet were unwilling to adopt the [[Americans For Democratic Action|ADA]] tactic of violent attack on the Communists. This group would have approved making the Progressives "non-Communist" rather than "antiCommunist", excluding but not assailing the Reds. Most persons sharing this view had, like [[Max Lerner]], completely avoided the party, but others like [[Rexford Guy Tugwell]] joined and stayed, if reluctantly, through the campaign….
* In the period following 1948, party members were hounded by the [[House Unamerican Activities Committee]], from job to job. Members found themselves fired from even the lowest of [[day labor]] jobs by FBI agents and others. Although historians point out that groups tended to leave the party in the order of their views from right to left, with most of the rightists departing during or shortly after the campaign, accompanied by many of the moderates. And the moderate defection, so marked following election day, 1948, becoming a nearly complete walkout in the summer of 1950, with the policy rift over Korea and Wallace's departure. Consequently, by the close of 1951 the few remaining portions of the Wallace Progressive Party were composed almost exclusively of the earlier extreme left group. These were the ones who had favored a "narrow" organization; after the Wallace break, they finally achieved this goal, with the departure of almost everyone else, this does not take into account the huge pressure to conform and stop the activism by HUAC and FBI. The fact that the member of congress defeated by [[Joe McCarthy]] was [[Robert La Follette Jr]], as an irony not lost on these activists. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]], whose father [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|"Fighting Bob" La Follette]] had run for president on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1924, had been head of the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] (which was not related to Wallace's party), though he had returned to the Republican fold by 1946. He was defeated by McCarthy in the Republican primary.

[[Orson Welles]], a friend of Roosevelt who had endorsed him in the 1944 election, refused to be involved with Wallace's Presidential campaign. Welles later described Wallace as "a prisoner of the [U.S.] Communist Party. He would never do anything to upset them."&lt;ref name=Biskind&gt;Peter Biskind (ed.). ''My Lunches with Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles'', Macmillan (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p. 66&lt;/sup&gt;

Schmidt, ''Henry A. Wallace: Quixotic Crusade 1948''. Syracuse University Press, 1960, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The slogan of the "New Party", and the name many used to refer to the party forming around Henry Wallace, was appropriately "Fight for Peace". A major drive for Henry Wallace had always been the ending of the hostile relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and the acceptance of Russian influence in Europe.&lt;ref name="digital.lib.uiowa.edu"/&gt; These sentiments were first put forward by Wallace in 1944, but those same sentiments soon began to take a more dramatic tone, as a sense of urgency and anxiety for peace settled in with the beginning of the arms race and the Cold War. Yet, while the "New Party" may be most famous for its anti-war, pro-Russian relations, it sought to include an incredibly broad range of issues and interests. The quote by Henry Wallace above shows how he, and many others in the party, sought to create something more than a single-issue party, to the objection of other leaders in the party who felt that would be their undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Karl M. Schmidt "Henry A. Wallace: Quixotic Crusade 1948" Syracuse ''Syracuse University Press'', 1960, pg 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the platform of the party and the range of issues it covered show the diversity of the people who formed the "New Party" in 1948, which included many socialists as well as communists. Among the policies the Progressive Party hoped to implement were the end of all Jim Crow laws/segregation in the South, the advancement of women's rights, the continuation of many New Deal policies including national health insurance and unemployment benefits, the expansion of the welfare system, and the nationalization of the energy industry among others.&lt;ref name="digital.lib.uiowa.edu"/&gt;

The ALSP also helped form a "New York State Wallace for President" conference, held on April 3, 1948.  ALP leaders Isacson and Marcantonio both spoke there.&lt;ref name=Withering /&gt;

During the Progressive Party's convention in July 1948 in Philadelphia, the following committees had the following ALP members:

==Prominent supporters==
Henry Wallace's bid for the presidency attracted the support of many prominent people in academia and the arts. Among those who publicly supported Wallace were [[Larry Adler]], [[George Antheil]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[Kermit Bloomgarden]], [[Morris Carnovsky]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Howard da Silva]], [[W. E. B. DuBois]], [[Howard Fast]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Judy Holliday]], [[Libby Holman]], [[John Huston]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Sam Jaffe]], [[Garson Kanin]], [[Howard E. Koch]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Canada Lee]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Albert Maltz]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Lewis Milestone]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[S. J. Perelman]], [[Anne Revere]], [[Budd Schulberg]], [[Adrian Scott]], [[Artie Shaw]], [[Philip Van Doren Stern]], [[I. F. Stone]], [[Louis Untermeyer]], [[Mark Van Doren]],  and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name="We Are For Wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson and Ruth Krauss|first1=Crockett|title="We Are For Wallace" (Crockett Johnson and Ruth Krauss Biography, Appendix B|url=http://www.philnel.com/2011/07/30/cjrk_b/|website=Nine Kinds of Pie|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lawson, Maltz and Scott were members of the [[Hollywood 10]], members of the movie industry who were called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for suspected membership in the Communist Party. Many of Wallace's public supporters were similarly hauled before HUAC and were blacklisted if they did not cooperate.

==Election results==
Running as peace candidates in the nascent Cold War era, the Wallace-Taylor ticket garnered no electoral votes and only 2.4 percent of the popular vote, far less than most pundits had anticipated; some historians have suggested that the Progressive campaign did Truman more good than harm, as their strident criticism of his foreign policy helped to undercut Republican claims that the administration's policies were insufficiently anti-Communist.  Nearly half of these votes were obtained in [[New York State]] (tipping the state and its 47 electoral votes from Truman to Dewey), where Wallace ran on the [[American Labor Party]] ballot line.

On September 11, 1948, for instance, the national committee of the Progressive Party passed a resolution which observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The totally unjustified decisions of the Illinois Electoral Board to rule the Progressive Party off the ballot is a clear violation of the most basic democratic concepts.

The decisions rob millions of the free citizens of Illinois of their right to vote for the Party and candidate of their choice.  They force the war policies of the old parties down the throats of freedom and peace-loving Americans.

Free Americans cannot—and will not—tolerate stolen elections.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This reflects a growing move by states to limit ballot access by any candidate other than the Republican or Democratic party candidates.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== The party at state level ==
In [[Massachusetts]], the anti-war Progressive Party was active in 1948 and faced discrimination in this state also.  On May 31, 1948, for instance, the Democratic Mayor of Boston, [[James Michael Curley|James Curley]], denied the use of the bandstand on the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]] to the Progressive Party of Massachusetts. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The following month, however, on June 29, one of the African-American leaders of the Progressive Party, Paul Robeson, was allowed to speak in the Crystal Ballroom in Boston's Hotel Bradford.

In [[Virginia]], in 1948, [[Virginia Foster Durr]] ran for the U.S. Senate seat on the Progressive ticket.

== Pop culture connection ==
One of the [[Kingston Trio]]'s most popular folk songs in the 1950s, "The MTA Song", was written by supporters of the Progressive Party of Massachusetts' 1949 [[Boston]] mayoralty candidate, [[Walter A. O'Brien]].  After Boston's publicly funded MTA purchased the privately owned Boston Elevated Railway's subway and trolley system for $30 per share more than each share was worth, the MTA imposed a fare increase on the citizens of Boston. Progressive Party mayoral candidate O'Brien then led unusually large protests against the MTA fare increase before the 1949 mayoral election. But although his campaign's anti-fare increase song was subsequently turned into a national hit record in the 1950s, O'Brien failed to win the local Boston election in 1949. When the Kingston Trio decided to record "The MTA Song", it was apparently agreed to change the first name of the O'Brien referred to in the song from "Walter" to "George", because it was feared that a hit record which referred to "Walter O'Brien" would make it even more difficult than it already was for the former Progressive Party candidate to find a New England employer who was willing to hire him during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Disbandment ==
After the 1948 election, Henry Wallace grew increasingly estranged from the Progressive Party. His speeches started to include mild criticism of Soviet foreign policy, which was anathema to many leftists in the party. The final break came in 1950, when the Progressive Party's executive committee issued a policy statement against US military involvement in Korea, and soundly rejected Wallace's proposed language criticizing the invasion by communist North Korea. Wallace came out in support of the US intervention in the Korean War, and quit the Progressive Party three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Culver and John Hyde, ''American Dreamer: a Life of Henry A&gt; Wallace'' (New York: Norton, 2000) 505-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]], the Progressive Party ran lawyer [[Vincent Hallinan]] for president. Their vice presidential candidate was [[Charlotta Bass]], the first [[African-American]] woman ever to run for national office. The campaign attracted little media attention and few votes, and was not even on the ballot in many states. Erstwhile Progressive candidate Henry A. Wallace supported Dwight D. Eisenhower, published an article in the September 7, 1952, issue of ''[[This Week (magazine)|This Week]]'' magazine (a Sunday supplement that was included in 37 American newspapers) entitled "Where I Was Wrong," detailing some of his mistakes in not having opposed Stalin strenuously enough. The Progressive Party disbanded in 1955, as the Cold War dominated the political spectrum, and any party which had not taken an anti-Communist position was deemed to be unviable.

The 1948 Progressive Party is but tenuously connected to the original Progressive Party (1912-1932) (although Henry A. Wallace's father had been a fervent [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Mooser]], and Wallace himself had only officially left the Republican party in 1936); members of the 1948 Progressive Party, however, have joined the later state Progressive Parties, thus linking the 1948 group to the [[Vermont Progressive Party]], the [[Progressive Dane|Wisconsin Prodanes]], and the [[Progressive Party of Washington]].

'''''Schutzjude''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌjuːdə|lang}}, "protected Jew") was a status for [[History of the Jews in Germany| German Jew]]s granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]), Jews usually had the status of [[Servi camerae regis]]. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire's treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated — by sale or pledge — their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their — not always reliable — imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews&amp;nbsp;— if any at all&amp;nbsp;— would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a ''Schutzbrief'' (writ of protection), a ''Geleitsbrief'' (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a ''Patent'', was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called ''Schutzjuden'', ''vergeleitete Juden'', or ''Patentjuden'', as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as ''unvergeleitete Juden''. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King [[Frederick II "the Great", King in Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] granted [[Moses Mendelssohn]], until then under protection by being employed by a ''Patentjude'', a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in [[Berlin]]. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a ''Patentjude'' when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable ''Patents''. In 1810 [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein's]] [[Prussian reforms]] introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the [[Huguenot]]s.

'''Spatial justice''' links together [[social justice]] and space, most notably in the works of geographers [[David Harvey]] and [[Edward W. Soja]]. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations ([[Henri Lefebvre]], 1968, 1972). Consequently, both [[justice]] and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.

== Social justice ==

According to this political theory, space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, [[social justice]] is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of "[[Justice]]" (and of the possible "[[social contract]]s" that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of [[regional planning]] or [[urban planning]] can be quite different and even contradictory.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American [[critical geography|radical geographers]] in the 1970s–1980s&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], ''Social Justice and the City'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;A conference investigating the concept of spatial justice was held in March 2008 at the University Paris-Ouest Nanterre, France. Moreover, ''justice spatiale - spatial justice'', a scientific Journal centered on Spatial Justice has been created in 2009: http://jssj.org/. A book focused on Spatial Justice has also been written by [[Edward W. Soja]] in 2010 : 
SOJA Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes ==
The concept of spatial justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers ([[John Rawls]], 1971; [[Iris Marion Young]], 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as [[Employment|job opportunities]], [[Health disparities|access to health care]], [[Air Quality Index|good air quality]], et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid [[pass laws]]).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer [[Don Mitchell (geographer)|Don Mitchell]] points to the mass [[privatization]] of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.

Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of [[oppression]] or [[discrimination]] that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from "results", or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.

== Environmental justice ==
The emergence of the concept of [[sustainable development]] has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of "Environmental Justice" was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of [[racial discrimination]] and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

The '''Special Warfare Department''' (SWD, {{lang-tr|Özel Harp Dairesi (ÖHD)}}) was the [[special forces]] unit of the [[Turkish Army]]. Founded in 1965, it was formed out of the Army's ''[[Tactical Mobilisation Group]]'' ({{lang-tr|Seferberlik Taktik Kurulu}}, STK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51/017.html Turkey's Killing Machine: The Contra-Guerrilla Force], Serdar Celik, in Kurdistan Report. No.17. February/March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It was disbanded in 1992, with special operations taken over by the new [[Special Forces (Turkish Armed Forces)|Special Forces Command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tackling the PKK: New Directions for Turkey's Special Forces|first=Emrullah|last=Uslu|volume=VI|issue=14|date=July 10, 2008|journal=Terrorism Monitor|publisher=[[Jamestown Foundation]]|pages=9–11|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=5045|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former members include [[Korkut Eken]].

==History==
The SWD were also fund and trained by the USA.&lt;ref name=Duthel2015&gt;{{cite book|author= Heinz Duthel|title=Global Secret and Intelligence Services I|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=gK5gBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=February 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-3738607789}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]] the SWD closely cooperated with the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Mehtap Söyler|title=The Turkish Deep State: State Consolidation, Civil-Military Relations and Democracy|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=_1KhBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=February 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1138782334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SWD encouraged and protected the Turkish [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] when they unleashed waves of bomb attacks and shootings that killed thousands of people, including students, lawyers, journalists, public officials, labor organizers, ethnic Kurds and others,  in the [[Political violence in Turkey (1976–80)|1970s]].&lt;ref name=Duthel2015 /&gt;

The SWD established the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]] at [[Cyprus]] in 1958 to counter the [[EOKA]] and to force partition of the island and supported it logistically and militarily. Arms were transferred from Turkey to support TMT, but as the arms transfer was blocked at international water the SWD contacted arms smugglers for this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mehtap Söyler|title=The Turkish Deep State: State Consolidation, Civil-Military Relations and Democracy|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=CcKgBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=February 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1138782334|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the SWD was involved in the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, under the command of [[Sabri Yirmibeşoğlu]]. In 2010 Yirmibeşoğlu reported to the television news channel [[Habertürk TV]] that Turkey burned a [[mosque]] during the [[Cyprus Intercommunal violence]] in order to foster civil resistance against Greeks on the disputed island, and that their rules of war included "[[false flag]]" acts, engaging in acts of sabotage made to look as if they were carried out by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], 24 September 2010, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turkey-burned-mosque-during-cyprus-war-gen-says-2010-09-24 Turkey burned mosque during Cyprus conflict, general says]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cultural Politics of Emotion''''', published in 2004 by [[Edinburgh University Press]] and Routledge, is a book by [[Sara Ahmed]] that focuses on the relationship between emotions, language, and bodies.&lt;ref name="Primary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Sara|title=Cultural Politics of Emotion|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415972550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed concentrates on the influence of emotions on the body and the way that bodies relate with communities, producing social relationships that determine the rhetoric of the nation.&lt;ref name="Riedner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riedner|first=Rachel C.|title=The Cultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed|journal=JAC Online Journal|volume=26|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book contributes to the growing conversation about emotion in [[rhetoric]] and [[cultural studies]] and employs a variety of theories including rhetorical theory, queer theory, feminist theory, Marxist theory, and poststructuralist theory of language.&lt;ref name=Riedner /&gt;

==Summary of Ahmed's hypothesis==
[[File:Vimy sculpture.JPG|thumb|''Mother Bereft'', Canadian War Memorial, France. Ahmed asks, "What does it do to say 'The nation mourns'?"]]
Ahmed argues emotions are cultural practices, not psychological states.&lt;ref name="Sapegno"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapegno|first=Maria Serena|title=Book Review: The Cultural Politics of Emotion|journal=Feminist Theory|date=30 October 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=370–372|doi=10.1177/1464700106069051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bodies are given value through emotion and thus the bodies, as well as the individuals, become aligned with a popular ideology.  Cultural politics of emotions creates "others" by aligning some bodies with each other inside a community and marginalizing other bodies. The repetition of words, or more broadly signs, elicits an emotional response that only grows upon more repetition.  Words often generate meaning because of their history and context, but eventually they can take on a new meaning.  Emotions are material rhetoric - they have affective power and can dictate our modes of life.  In fact, they are gateways into the social and material world.  Emotions can lead to collective politics and social alliances; this social power is exhibited through politics and social movement, even to create national identities.&lt;ref name=Riedner /&gt;  To illustrate her points, Ahmed analyzes public texts and the figurative language that they employ to name or perform emotion.&lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;  Ahmed's theory encourages readers to consider the political implications of emotion.&lt;ref name=Riedner /&gt;

==Contents==
Ahmed's book centers around three political events and ideas: the reconciliation of Australian aboriginal children to their families, the public's response to international terrorism, and asylum and immigration in the United Kingdom.  She analyzes texts surrounding these concepts to demonstrate how emotions are public and how the public is emotive.&lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;

The book is broken down into the following chapters:
#The Contingency of Pain: Discusses the way that pain is used in politics to demand action or shape identities &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#The Organisation of Hate: Discusses the role of hate in nation building to separate self from others &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#The Affective Politics of Fear: Argues that responses to terrorism work as an economy of fear &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#The Performativity of Disgust: Emphasizes the way that the public views the "other" with disgust &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#Shame Before Others: Asserts that shame can form a collective ideal and work for nation building &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#In the Name of Love: Discusses the way that multicultural love can help build a nation's identity &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#Queer Feelings: Considers the importance of emotions in queer theory &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#Feminist Attachments: Discusses the role of emotions in feminist theory &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;

==Critical response and references==

Ahmed's work has been referenced to in many different texts since its creation in 2004, but below are just a few instances where Ahmed's ideas have been discussed.

Greg Noble, a professor at the [[University of Western Sydney]] who was once disgruntled with many concepts of cultural theory, says that Ahmed's book contains an analysis that has moved on from traditions in psychology and sociology in productive ways. She successfully covers a diverse range of emotions and sensations in a variety of contemporary topics. But most attractive to Noble is her development of an understanding of how emotions move - that is, how bodies and worlds materialize from emotion, particularly in the process of nation building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Greg|title=Book Review: Faces of Shame, The Cultural Politics of Emotion|journal=[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]|date=11 May 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=249–253|doi=10.1177/1367877906064033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to a collection of essays on the theoretical engagement with emotions and affectivity, Ahmed's theory is referred to as groundbreaking.  They commend her ability to depict the relationship between bodies, language, and emotion while also analyzing the intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, and nation through a variety of histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Athanasiou|first=Athena |author2=Pothiti Hantzaroula |author3=Kostas Yannakopolous|title=Towards a New Epistemology: The "Affective Turn"|journal=Historein|year=2008|volume=8|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book entitled ''Emotion in Education'', Paul A. Schutz and Reinhard Pekrun apply Ahmed's theories of emotional politics to the classroom, emphasizing Ahmed's idea that emotions are not private but are socially organized.  In addition, they use Ahmed's idea of affective economics - that emotions can be used as economy because they become attached to material objects that join some people together while separating others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schutz|first=Paul A.|author2=Reinhard Pekrun |title=Emotion in Education|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|location=Burlington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another text about education and emotions, Michalinos Zembylas discusses the notion of emotional capital, pulling from Bourdieu's various ideas about capital. He works to pull together contemporary discussion about the phrase emotional capital, especially in terms of education, and uses Ahmed's ideas in this synthesis of discussion. He points out the growing emphasis on emotion, especially within cultural studies, but turns the focus of his article to education. Zembylas employs Ahmed's idea that emotions help form the boundaries and relationships between individuals and society, but emotions themselves don't reside in either space. Emotions help us connect with some people while distancing us from others and in material form can be used for political purposes, making it a form of capital. Zembylas concludes that evaluating this emotional capital can help us better understand some of the dynamics that take place in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zembylas|first=Michalinos|title=Emotional Capital and Education: Theoretical Insights from Bourdieu|journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|date=December 2007|volume=55|issue=4|pages=443–463|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3pillars originofpoliticalorder.gif|thumb|The three components/pillars of a stable state according to Fukuyama]]
'''''The Origins of Political Order''''' is a 2011 book by [[Political economy|political economist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] about what makes a state stable. It uses a comparative [[political history]] to develop a theory of the stability of a [[political system]]. According to Fukuyama, a stable state needs to be modern and strong, to obey the rule of law governing the state and be accountable.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}

{{toclimit|2}}

==Series of books==
The book is the first of two books on the development of [[Political system|political order]]. This book goes from its origins to the [[French Revolution]]. The next book ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day]]'', published in September 2014, starts with the French Revolution and carries the analysis to the present day.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=furedi/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hewson&gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy]]''. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why states and institutions fail==
The book is an attempt to understand why modern statebuilding and the building of institutions in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone and Liberia have failed to live up to expectations.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|loc=Preface}}

In the aftermath of its 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US administration seemed genuinely surprised when the Iraqi state itself collapsed in an orgy of looting and civil conflict.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=13}}

The book is about "getting to Denmark," in other words creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and honest societies.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web|title=''How To Get to the End of History or "getting to Denmark"'' review|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/05/how_to_get_to_the_end_of_history.html |work=Slate|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama points out that at the time of writing ninety contemporary 'primitive' societies had been engaged in war,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=73}} suggesting that political order is preferable to primitive social structures if stability is to be achieved. The author describes how attempts at shaping countries outside the western world into western type democracies failed, and that this book was an attempt to find out why, by trying to find the true origins of political order, by tracing the histories of China, India, Europe and some Muslim countries from the point of view of three components.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312}}

==Aims==
Since the aim of the book is to understand how institutions and states develop in different countries, it is also a book on [[comparative historical research]].

It is an extension of [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Political Order in Changing Societies]]'' and similar in scope to [[Jared Diamond]]’s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name=sailer&gt;{{cite web|title= Fukuyama's World  |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fukuyamas-world/ |work=The American Conservative|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama develops his argument with respect to the history of China, India and the Middle East before focusing on the way European countries developed in a variety of directions.&lt;ref name=blackburn&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Robert|title=''The Origins of Political Order'' review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-origins-of-political-order-from-prehuman-times-to-the-french-revolution-by-francis-fukuyama-2283020.html |work=The Independent|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From pre-human origins to states==

===From chimpanzee hunting groups to tribes===
In his quest for the origins of political order, he first looks at the social order among chimpanzees, notes that the war-like hunting group, rather than the family, was the primary social group, and claims the same for humans. Humans went further: to survive they formed tribes, whose armies were superior to hunting groups by their sheer size.&lt;ref name= hewson &gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=
https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marq&gt;{{cite web|title= Review|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2011/06/fukuyama-order-state-india |work=New Statesman|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burl&gt;{{cite web|title=  A dense study of global political development |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8540907/The-Origins-of-Political-Order-by-Francis-Fukuyama-review.html |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He uses recent work in sociobiology and other sources to show that sociability built on kin selection and reciprocal altruism is the original default social state of man and not any isolated, presocial human as suggested by [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=lind&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Michael|title=''Francis Fukuyama's Theory of the State'' review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-the-origins-of-political-order-by-francis-fukuyama.html?pagewanted=all |work=New York Times|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=439}} He suggests that Hobbes and Locke present a fallacy when they argue humans developed cooperative ability only as a result of the invention of the state. This is because chimps, the genetic ancestors to humans, engage in kin relations based on cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Waal|first1=Frans|title=Chimpanzee Politics|date=2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Hobbes and Locke must be suggesting humans were once sociable, lost this instinct and then regained it due to the state.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=34}}

===Challenge of tribes on the road towards the state===
The next step was to escape beyond tribalism and the "tyranny of cousins", to join tribes into larger coalitions&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt; towards states, again due to the advantage of larger armies. This was done with the aid of religion.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt; This was because as groups grew in size, maintaining cooperation became more difficult as face-to-face interactions with much of society became difficult. Religion offered a way of providing a combining social force to hold society together .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=37}} For example, Fukuyama cites [[Mohammed]] as an example of what Weber labels a "[[charismatic leader]]" because he used the idea of an '[[umma]]' (community of believers) to bind together the territory that he ruled over .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=87}} This challenge to transcend tribalism partly remains today in many parts of the world that is outside Western civilization, for example in Afghanistan and in Somalia.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt;

====Restrictions on marriage and inheritance as a strategy against corruption====
Loyalty to the tribe or the family, rather than to the state, leads to corruption and weakening of the state. Various strategies were used to overcome the corruption. One such strategy was restrictions against marriage among the ruling official class to make sure that loyalties would not lie with family or tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarins or [[Scholar-official]]s, who were the ruling class of China, were not allowed to pass on the lands given to them by the emperor to their own children and were restricted as to whom they were allowed to marry.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=116,367}}

[[Mamluk]] slaves, the ruling class of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, were told which slaves to marry while their children could not inherit from them.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=198}}[[Jannissary|Jannisarries]] were originally forced into celibacy or and prohibited from having a family.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=219}}{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=225}}

[[Pope Gregory VII]] forced Catholic priests in Europe to become celibate and they were prohibited from having a family for the same reason.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=264}}

Spanish administrators in South America were restricted from to marrying local women and from establishing family ties in the territories they were sent to.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=367}}

==Three components of political order==
The books develops the idea of the development of the three components of a modern political order, which are,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}
# '''[[State (polity)#The modern state|State building]]'''
# '''[[Rule of law]]'''
# '''Accountable government'''

[[China]], [[India]], the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and Europe each developed these three components of political organization in different order, in different ways and to different degrees. Denmark and the United Kingdom arrived first at a modern balance of the three components in a single package, follow by others by the nineteenth century, as the Netherlands and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}

[[File:Fukuyama article2.png|thumb|Origins of Political Order depend on three components, according to Fukuyama. States with all three components, are more stable, and are shown in the middle.]]

===China===
China is described as having the first modern state,&lt;ref name=econom1&gt;{{cite web|title=''The good, the great and the gelded'' review|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18483257 |work=The Economist|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the definition given, since it established an educated Mandarin bureaucracy, although Hewson objects to this conclusion since the Mandarin bureaucracy was not modern.&lt;ref name=hewson/&gt; China used extreme violence on its population (especially during the influence of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=120}}), but had a weak rule of law and the emperor had no accountability to anyone.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

===India===
India is contrasted with China. India could not use extreme force on its population due to the traditional power of the [[brahmin]] [[priestly caste]], who protested violence against the populace and war against neighboring states, by refusing to perform ancestral rituals for the [[Raja]] leaders. The power of the Brahmins weakening the state's power over its people, and effectively forced a strong accountability on its leaders to the population of India via its priestly class.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=158-167}} An example Fukuyama gives of the influence religion had on early Indian rulers is [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) of the [[Maurya Dynasty]], who under the influence of Buddhism (rather than Brahmanism) came to regret his conquests in the Kalinga War. He vowed to end his empire, and eventually the entire political system collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=182}}

===Muslim states===
Certain Muslim states developed the practice of making imported slaves as the ruling class, as with the [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt and the Janissaries of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire, a process which started around the 8th century. Since these ruling class slaves were neither beholden to family nor to any tribe, but dependent only on the state, it ensured their loyalty towards the state.&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=218-219}} A later example would be the 16th-century Ottoman Empire practice of seeking out intelligent Christian children for high civil service or military positions, who were cut off from their family for their training.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=190}}

===Europe===
In 11th-century Europe, instead of the state having the upper hand as in China, or the Brahmins having the upper hand as in India, there was a power conflict between state and church, the [[Investiture Controversy]] between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266}}

The papal party started to search for sources of law to strengthen its case for the universal jurisdiction of the church. They rediscovered the Justinian Code, the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]], in a library near Bologna in northern Italy in 1072, leading later to the student body called a "universitas", first in Bologna, and soon after in Paris, Oxford, Heidelberg, Cracow, and Copenhagen studying the code and displacing particularistic Salic law.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=268-269}} The laws gave the Gregory the authority to [[excommunicate]] Henry IV, who was forced to [[walk to Canossa]] from Germany to Italy, stand barefoot{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=168}} in the snow for three days{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=265}} outside Canossa and to ask forgiveness from the pope on his knees.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=268}} The [[Concordat of Worms]] ended the struggle between popes and emperors in 1122. It created balance between royal power and religious tradition not seen anywhere else before.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

Catholic leaders became accountable to the clergy and to the pope, who historically frequently objected to violence and wars, just as their counterparts in India had done, but in Europe the clergy did not weaken the states as much as Brahmins had done in India. The papal intercessions against wars between Catholic countries also led to the survival of small states in Europe, similar to India, but in contrast to what had happened in China. The existence of small states who were restricted by the church from recruiting mass armies waging wars costly in casualties, as had been the case in China, combined with the existence of independent university scholars, led to military innovations on land and sea to empower fewer soldiers to wield wars effectively and later gave these relatively small countries a military advantage large enough to conquer colonies in the rest of the world. Western Europe began getting the best of both worlds. In England, the rise of common law also strengthened the rule of law. With the reformation, the Lutheran priest N.F.S. Grundtvig in Denmark advocated general literacy since they believed that every Christian should read the bible and established schools throughout the country, leading to voting rights 1849.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;434}} In Denmark this led to the state gradually being more accountable to the general population, since they could now vote and read. In England and Denmark a balance was finally struck between the three components of political order.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;269}}

==Balance between the components==
A successful modern liberal democracy balances all three components to achieve stability.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=6,188}}

In China a strong modern state came to power first and the state subjugated any potential agents that might have demanded the other two components. In China, the priestly class did not develop into an organized independent religion, as the priests were in the service of the Emperor. Numerous times, therefore, imperial dynasties collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=151}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In India, the Brahmins became organised into a strong upper caste of India and the warrior/state caste was held to account by a rule of law as interpreted by the Brahmins. Because of the state was weakened by this limitation, attempts at unifying India under one rule did not last very long.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=183}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In Europe, there was a long period when the emperors and popes were in conflict, creating a balance of power between them,&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; and ultimately leading to a situation where some small states developed a stable balance between the three components in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

'''Theories of political behavior''', as an aspect of [[political science]], attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person's political views, [[ideology]], and levels of political participation. Broadly speaking, behavior is political whenever individuals or groups try to influence or escape the influence of others. Political behavior is the subset of human behavior that involves politics and powers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.”&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists who have had an influence on this field include [[Karl Deutsch]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

==Long-term influences on political orientation==
Interaction with the political views of parental figures is often thought of as the primary long-term influence on political orientation and willingness to take part in the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidengil|first=Elisabeth|last2=Wass|first2=Hanna|last3=Valaste|first3=Maria|date=June 2016|title=Political Socialization and Voting: The Parent-Child Link in Turnout|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44018017|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=69|pages=373-383|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx|title=Teens Stay True to Parents' Political Perspectives|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teacher]]s and other educational authority figures are also often thought to have a significant impact on political orientation. During the 2003-2004 school year, In the United States, students spent an average of 180.4 days in primary and secondary education each year, with a school day being defined as approximately 6.7 class hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/tables/table_2004_06.asp|title=Private School Universe Survey (PSS)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on average a student will spend around 1,208.68 hours in class each year. [[Post-secondary education]] appears to have an impact on both voting rates and political identification; as a study of 9,784,931 college students found that they voted at a rate of 68.5% in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve/2016|title=2016 NSLVE National Data|last=|first=|date=2017-09-18|website=Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the average of 46.1% for citizens aged 18-29 who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peers also affect political orientation. Friends often, but not necessarily, have the advantage of being part of the same generation, which collectively develops a unique set of societal issues; Eric L. Dey has argued that "socialisation is the process through which individuals acquire knowledge, habits, and value orientations that will be useful in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Dey, Eric L., ''Undergraduate Political Attitudes: Peer Influence in Changing Social Contexts'', Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 68, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to relate on this common level is what fuels and enables future ideological growth.

Sociologists and political scientists debate the relationship between age and the formation of political attitudes. The [[impressionable years hypothesis]] postulates that political orientation is solidified during early adulthood. By contrast, the "increasing persistence hypothesis" posits that attitudes become less likely to change as individuals become older, while the "life-long openness hypothesis" proposes that the attitudes of individuals remain flexible regardless of age.&lt;ref name="krosnick1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krosnick|first1=Jon A.|last2=Alwin|first2=Duane F.|title=Aging and Susceptibility to Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=3|pages=416–425|url=https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/1989-Aging-and-Att-Change-Krosnick-and-Alwin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-term influences on political orientation==
Short-term factors also affect [[voting behavior]]; the [[mass media|media]] and the impact of individual [[election]] issues are among these factors. These factors differ from the long-term factors as they are often short-lived. However, they can be just as crucial in modifying political orientation. The ways in which these two sources are interpreted often relies on the individuals specific political ideology formed by the long-term factors.

Most [[political scientist]]s agree that the mass media have a profound impact on voting behavior. One author asserts that "few would argue with the notion that the institutions of the mass media are important to contemporary politics ... in the transition to liberal democratic politics in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] the media was a key battleground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guidetowinningelections.com/do-mass-media-influence-the-political-behavior-of-citizens/|title=Do Mass Media Influence the Political Behavior of Citizens|date=2013-11-26|work=The Guide to Winning Elections|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, there are election issues. These include campaign issues, debates and commercials. Election years and political campaigns can shift certain political behaviors based on the candidates involved, which have different degrees of effectiveness in influencing voters.

==The influence of social groups on political outcomes==
Recently, some political scientists have been interested in many studies which aimed to analyze the relation between the behavior of social groups and the political outcomes. Some of the social groups included in their studies have been age demographics, [[gender]], and [[ethnic groups]].

For example, in [[U.S. politics]], the effect of ethnic groups and gender has a great influence on the political outcomes.

[[Latin Americans]] have a profound social impact on the political outcome of their vote and are emerging as a strong up-and-coming political force. The most noticeable increase in Latin American voting was in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], although the votes did not share a socially common political view at that time. In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], the Latin American vote aided tremendously in the election of [[Florida]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Mel Martinez]], although in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], about 44% of Latin Americans voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]]. However, Latin Americans have the lowest voting rate in the United States, with only 47.6% voting in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently illegal immigration has been claiming the most attention and Latin Americans, although not completely unanimous, are concerned with the education, employment and deportation of illegal immigrants in the United States. Although the majority of Latin Americans vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates, [[Cuban Americans]] are likely the most conservative of Latinos, with 54% of Cuban American voters casting ballots for [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]], compared to an average of 35% of all Latinos who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/15/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump/|title=About half of Cuban voters in Florida backed Trump|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was represents a net decrease in support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] among Cuban Americans, it continues a trend created by the [[Cuban exile|exile of many Cubans]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/op-ed/articles/2016-11-16/2016-highlighted-the-growing-complexity-of-the-cuban-american-vote|title=The Complex Cuban Vote|last=Lopez-Gottardi|first=Cristina|date=2016-11-16|work=U.S. News|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African Americans]] have the second highest voting rates in the United States and even surpassed white voters in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]], although this has declined in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]. In the 2008 Presidential Election and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]], African Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2008/|title=How Groups Voted in 2008 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/|title=How Groups Voted in 2012 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of African Americans voting for candidates of the Democratic Party continued into the 2016 Presidential Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the United States have, in the past 30 years, surpassed male voting rates, with the 2016 Presidential Election having a ratio between females and males of 52 to 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1980/|title=How Groups Voted in 1980 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1984/|title=How Groups Voted in 1984 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1988/|title=How Groups Voted in 1988 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is often referred to as the Gender Gap and when combined with the tendency of women to vote for Democratic candidates, their effect on political outcomes is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/opinion/trump-midterms-gender-gap.html|title=Opinion {{!}} What Happens if the Gender Gap Becomes a Gender Chasm?|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Biology and political science ==
Interdisciplinary studies in [[biology and political science]] aim to identify correlates of political behavior with biological aspects, for example the linkage of [[biology and political orientation]], but also with other aspects like [[partisanship]] and [[voting behavior]].&lt;ref name="SomitPeterson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Somit|author2=Steven A. Peterson|title=Biology and Political Behavior: The Brain, Genes and Politics - The Cutting Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__M0gG5kWg8C&amp;pg=PA232|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-580-9|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is typically referred to [[genopolitics]] although it is sometimes referred to as [[biopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Blank2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Blank|title=Biology and Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAXYIkbWxawC|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20436-1|quote=This book demonstrates the increasing convergence of interest of some social scientists in the theories, research and findings of the life sciences in building a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of politics. It discusses the development of biopolitics as an academic perspective within political science, reviews the growing literature in biopolitics, and presents a coherent view of biopolitics as a framework for structuring inquiry across the current subfields of political science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term has other meanings.

The study of possible genetic bases of political behavior has grown since the 1980s. The term [[genopolitics]] was coined by political scientist [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]] in the early-2000s to describe research into identifying specific transporter/receptor genes responsible for ideological orientation beyond the sociopsychological realm of political socialisation.

==Political participation==

Political scientists also aim to understand what drives individuals to participate in the democratic process, either by voting, volunteering for campaigns, signing petitions or protesting. Participation cannot always be explained by rational behavior. The [[voting paradox]], for example, points out that it cannot be in a citizen's self-interest to vote because the effort it takes to vote will almost always outweigh the benefits of voting, particularly considering a single vote is unlikely to change an electoral outcome. Political scientists instead propose that citizens vote for psychological or social reasons. Studies show, for example, that individuals are more likely to vote if they see their friends have voted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Corbyn |first1=Zoe |title=Facebook experiment boosts US voter turnout |url=https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 |website=Nature |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if someone in their household has received a nudge to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickerson |first1=David |title=Is Voting Contagious?

'''Vote trading''' is the practice of [[voting]] in the manner another person wishes on a [[legislative bill|bill]], position on a more general issue, or favored candidate in exchange for the other person's vote in the manner one wishes on another position, proposal, or candidate.  Nearly all voting systems do not make vote trading a formal process, so vote trading is very often informal and thus not binding.
One form of vote trading that is formal is one that involves the trading of proxy voting rights - party A gets Party B's voting right formally,  eg as a filled in proxy form with signature, perhaps authenticated by secretariats, and in this case party A may use B's vote on issue 1, and B uses A's vote on issue 2... votes traded.

==In legislatures==

Vote trading frequently occurs between and among members of legislative bodies. For example, Congressman A might vote for a dam in Congressman B's district in exchange for Congressman B's vote for farm subsidies in Congressman A's district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7241-2004Oct4.html|title=Vote-Trading Ethics|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2004-10-05|accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first examples of vote trading to occur in the United States was the [[Compromise of 1790]], in which [[Thomas Jefferson]] made a deal with [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] to move the capital from New York to a site along the Potomac (after a lengthy stay in Philadelphia) in exchange for federal assumption of debts incurred by the states in the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Vote Trading in the First Federal Congress?: James Madison and the Compromise of 1790|author=Kiewiet, D. Roderick|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindrances to vote trading in the U.S. Congress include its bicameral structure and the geographic representation basis of its members. Vote trading is encouraged, however, by Congress's relatively loose [[party discipline]] which facilitates policy cross-overs by individual congressmen, in sharp contrast to European countries. In any case, vote trading is effectively a binding contract in the house, as both participants can actually see each other at the time of voting. If one party breaks their promise the other might change their vote on the issues involved in the trade, and be rather unfriendly with the other party in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Economy of Rent-seeking|author1=Rowley, Charles Kershaw|author2=Tollison, Robert D.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among citizens==
{{Main article|Vote pairing in the United States presidential election, 2016}}

===United States presidential elections===

Vote trading occasionally occurs between United States citizens [[domicile (law)|domicile]]d in different states (and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|therefore citizens of those respective states]]) to demonstrate support for third-party candidates while minimizing the risk that their more favored (or less disfavored) major-party candidate will lose [[electoral vote]]s in the nationwide election (''i.e.'', the "[[spoiler effect]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votepair.org/howitworks.php|title=How It Works|publisher=VotePair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
*A Republican-leaning libertarian whose preference order is {Libertarian, Republican, Democrat/[[Green Party (United States)|Green]], Green/Democrat} and who lives in a "[[swing state]]" might trade votes with a Republican who has libertarian sympathies, lives in a state considered "safe Republican" or "safe Democrat", and has preference order {Republican, Libertarian, Democrat/Green, Green/Democrat}.
*A Democratic-leaning [[Progressivism|progressivist]] or socialist whose preference order is {[[Green Party (United States)|Green]], Democrat, Libertarian/Republican, Republican/Libertarian} and who lives in a swing state might trade votes with a Democrat whose preference order is {Democrat, Green, Republican/Libertarian, Libertarian/Republican} and who lives in a state safe for one major party or another.
In either case, both candidates and both voters receive a net benefit at minimal (if any) cost:
* The third-party candidate improves his/her showing as a percentage of the nationwide [[Direct election|popular vote]], increasing his/her party's visibility and prompting the voting public (including major-party sympathizers with the third party's platform) to take the third party more seriously.  Most notably, organizations hosting presidential-candidate debates may require that a party clear a certain popular-vote threshold in one election in order for its candidate in the next election to qualify for the debates held in advance of that election, and vote trading helps the candidate reach that threshold.  Because the third-party supporter in the swing state would likely vote for the more favored or less disfavored major-party candidate in the absence of a vote trade, the third-party candidate has little to lose from the vote trade's guarantee that the swing-state vote will be cast for the major party.
* The major-party candidate gains a potentially significant vote in a swing state while losing only a much less valuable vote in a state in which the candidate has little if anything to gain (if the other state is safe for that candidate) or to lose (if the other state is safe for the opponent) by keeping that vote.
* The voter supporting the third party is able to vote for his or her second choice with a clearer conscience given that the vote trade represents a choice in favor of the greater good as well as the lesser evil (mitigating [[Deontology|deontological]] concerns such as Gandhi's maxim "If you choose the lesser of two evils, you are still choosing evil.").
* A major-party supporter who considers vote trading permissible to begin with, and who thus subscribes to at least some [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] moral principles, will have few if any qualms about voting for a second-choice candidate in situations in which doing so provides a benefit much larger than the negligible cost of a vote that is futile (in a state safe for the opposing major party) or redundant (in a state safe for that voter's party).
Vote trading thereby improves the outcome as measured by both candidates' preference orders and according to both "maximax" and "[[maximin (decision theory)|maximin]]" evaluation standards, at least given the constraints on the set of possible outcomes imposed by the "bottleneck" effect of the winner-take-all electoral-vote allocation procedure.

Presidential vote trading between citizens has increased in popularity since the development of the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]] facilitated interstate communications between individuals not personally known to each other but identifiable by [[User ID|user account names]].

==In non-governmental contexts==

Corporate vote trading has been proposed as a way of improving corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/waslbp/9904.html|title=Corporate Vote-Trading as an Instrument of Corporate Governance|author1=Neeman, Z.  |author2=Orosel, G.O. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, vote trading refers to borrowing shares of a stock in time to be the shareholder of record on the day of an important vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B3E0BF08B-F814-4A15-AAF5-6558FB7286E8%7D&amp;siteid=google|title=Vote early, vote often|author=Hulbert, Mark|date=2006-03-31|publisher=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

A variant called [[vote pairing]] refers to voters on opposite sides in a single vote agreeing to abstain from voting or otherwise changing their vote.  This technique is often used by legislators who do not wish to take time to come to the floor for a vote.  A legislator will find a member on the opposite side of the issue who also desires to save time, and they will both agree to skip the vote, maintaining the balance of votes on each side.

==Ethical considerations==
''The Limits of Public Choice: A Sociological Critique of the Economic Theory'' notes that vote trading is often considered immoral, since votes should be determined on the basis of the merits of the question. It is viewed as being less serious an offense than bribery, although in some countries it is still unlawful. However, vote-trading can also be viewed as beneficial to democracy in that it makes it possible for minorities to exert some influence and thus alleviate the [[tyranny of the majority]]. In this way, vote-trading is similar to coalition-building, which also involves an exchange of policies and bargaining over cabinet positions in order to gain the parliamentary majority needed for approval of the entire program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Limits of Public Choice: A Sociological Critique of the Economic Theory|author=Udhen, Lars|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been academic proposals to streamline the legislative vote trading process by creating a market brokered by party leaders in which members buy and sell votes at prices set by supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w40x621203xkl223/|title=Centralized vote-trading|author=Kenneth J. Koford|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/BF00162117|volume=39|journal=Public Choice|pages=245–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Policy Conference (WPC)''' is an independent organization&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2015/11/22/923633/iranian-diplomat-in-switzerland-for-world-policy-conference|title=Tasnim News Agency - Iranian Diplomat in Switzerland for World Policy Conference|website=Tasnim News Agency|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose aim is to contribute to improving all aspects of [[governance]], with a view to promoting a world that is more open, prosperous, fairer and more respectful of the diversity of States and nations. It was launched in 2008, by [[Thierry de Montbrial]], President and Founder of the [[Institut français des relations internationales|French Institute of International Relations (''Ifri'')]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/patrick/2011/12/12/nuggets-from-the-world-policy-conference/|title=The Internationalist » Nuggets from the World Policy Conference|website=Council on Foreign Relations - The Internationalist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This annual conference revolves around debates gathering economic and political leaders, [[diplomat]]s, representatives of [[civil society]], experts and [[journalist]]s from all over the world. It aims at reflecting, debating, and offering constructive solutions to major regional and international issues, in an atmosphere of respect and tolerance.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iman-worldwide.org/newsroom/our-news/ribal-alassad-attends-the-world-policy-conference-in-montreux-switzerland|title=The Iman Foundation|website=www.iman-worldwide.org|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the World Policy Conference ranked 3rd best Think Tank Conference according to The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP) at the Lauder Institute, [[University of Pennsylvania]] '2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'.

== History ==
Launched in 2008 by [[Thierry de Montbrial]], the President and Founder of the [[Institut français des relations internationales|French Institute of International Relations (''Ifri'')]], the World Policy Conference (WPC) is the first effort to foster systematic reflection on organizing [[global governance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/presidents-and-chiefs-of-state/view-obama-administration/p35216|title=The View from the Obama Administration|website=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; tailored to 21st century realities, bringing together the highest-level decision-makers, experts and opinion leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/monde-trois-raisons-inquieter-world-policy-conference-jean-marc-sylvestre-926210.html|title=Le monde a trois raisons de s'inquiéter|website=Atlantico.fr|language=french|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the conference took place in [[Évian-les-Bains|Evian]] ([[France]]), from October 6–8, 2008.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/first-world-policy-conference-meets-in-evian/|title=First World Policy Conference meets in Evian|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The foundations of the WPC ==
The World Policy Conference (WPC) was founded on three complementary ideas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=DIPLOMATIC MEMO; Europe Still Likes Obama, But Doubts Creep In|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=2009-11-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Policy Conference|last=|first=|publisher=World Policy Conference|year=2014|isbn=978-2-36567-274-0|location=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WPC_interieur_ANG.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Striving for an effective global governance|last=|first=|publisher=World Policy Conference|year=2011|isbn=|location=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/wpc_compendium/index.html|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- the nature of [[Globalization|globalisation]]

The World Policy Conference falls within a context where [[Globalization|globalisation]] and interconnections between countries have never been stronger, whether it is on a political, economic or environmental level. During its first edition in 2008, the conference has addressed the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime crisis]], which had just broken out in the [[United States]] and has spared no continents since then.

- [[International relations]] are still centered on relations between states

Despite phenomena of [[Globalization|globalisation]], the world is still organized around political entities, States. They are characterized by a territory, a population and a government. They also share common culture, values, institutions, and have delimited borders.

- The construction of the new international system – or rather of its [[governance]] – is not just a matter for states

In order to ensure good [[global governance]], states must reform and cooperate. However, they cannot be the only ones to work to that end. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[think tank]]s, including the [[Institut français des relations internationales|French Institute of International Relations ''(Ifri)'']], have to take part in this process as well. Each member should be able to express his point of view and influence the choices made via a proper decision-making process. Finally, global institutions ([[United Nations|UN]]), as well as regional ([[African Union]], [[Arab League]]) and specialized institutions ([[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[World Health Organization]]) have to adjust to the new global order and find adequate solutions.

== A centre of influence, thinking and debate ==
The three meeting formats – namely, the plenary sessions,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; workshops and lunch or dinner debates – are based on the concept of constructive public-private interaction at the highest level. During plenary sessions, each speaker has an exclusive and equal right to the floor, regardless of his home country’s status on the world stage.

== An informal meeting-place ==
Each participant is individually chosen on the basis of a range of criteria, such as regional, functional and media-related factors. The number of participants at each conference remains limited to ensure that meetings are as productive as possible. On this basis and in a warm and welcoming setting, all the conditions are met for participants to speak their mind freely, thereby creating a very high-level yet informal meeting-place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Conference follow-up ==
As the conference proceedings are intended to fuel public debate, they are largely “on the record” and widely disseminated.

=== Print publications ===
A report is published after each WPC conference. This report contains the most noteworthy excerpts from the presentations and the profiles of all the participants, as well as a description of all the WPC’s partners. Each conference’s highlights are illustrated with a large number of images. Thousands of copies of this bilingual (French-English) publication are distributed worldwide every year. The report can also be downloaded in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format from the WPC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/2015-publications/|title=World Policy Conference  » 2015 Publications|website=www.worldpolicyconference.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media ===
The WPC website provides access not only to all past conferences but also to the latest information on the forthcoming conference.
