'''Art Nouveau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|r|t|_|n|uː|ˈ|v|oʊ|,_|ˌ|ɑː|r}}; {{IPA-fr|aʁ nuvo|lang}})  is an international [[style (visual arts)|style]] of art, architecture and [[applied art]], especially the [[decorative arts]], that was most popular between 1890 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reaction to the [[academic art]] of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.

English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art).  The style is related to, but not identical with,  styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time:  in Austria it is known as ''[[Vienna Secession|Secessionsstil]]'' after ''[[Wiener Secession]]''; in Spanish ''Modernismo''; in Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]''; in Czech ''Secese''; in Danish ''Skønvirke'' or ''Jugendstil''; in German ''Jugendstil'', Art Nouveau or ''Reformstil''; in Hungarian ''Szecesszió''; in Italian Art Nouveau, ''Stile Liberty'' or  ''Stile floreale''; in Lithuanian ''Modernas''; in Norwegian ''Jugendstil''; in Polish ''Secesja''; in Slovak ''Secesia''; in Ukrainian and Russian ''Модерн'' (Modern)&lt;!--''Ар-нуво'' [Ar-nuvo] or ''Югендстиль'' [JUgendstil']--&gt;; in Swedish and Finnish ''Jugend''.

Art Nouveau is a [[gesamtkunstwerk|total art style]]: It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, [[Art Nouveau furniture|furniture]], textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work. 

By 1910, Art Nouveau was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by [[Art Deco]] and then by [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Hope, review of H. Lenning, ''The Art Nouveau'', ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 34 (June 1952), 168–171 (esp. 168–169): Discussing the state of Art Nouveau during 1952, the author notes that Art Nouveau, which had become disfavored, was not yet an acceptable study for serious art history or a subject suitable for major museum exhibitions and their respective catalogs. He predicts an impending change, however.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Michèle Lavallée, "Art Nouveau", ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Art Nouveau took its name from the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' (''House of the New Art''), an art gallery opened in 1895 by the Franco-German [[art dealer]] [[Siegfried Bing]] that featured the new style. In France, Art Nouveau was also sometimes called by the British term "Modern Style" due to its roots in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], ''Style moderne'', or ''Style 1900.''&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; It was also sometimes called ''Style Jules Verne'', ''Le Style Métro'' (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), ''Art Belle Époque'', and ''Art fin de siècle''.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, where the architectural movement began, it was sometimes termed ''Style nouille'' (noodle style) or ''Style coup de fouet'' (whiplash style).&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Britain, it was known as the ''Modern Style'', or, because of the Arts and Crafts movement led by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow,  as the [[Glasgow School|"Glasgow" style]].

In Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty &amp; Co]] department store (mostly designed by [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]), it was sometimes called the ''Stile Liberty'' ("Liberty style"),  ''Stile floral'', or ''Arte nova'' (New Art).

In the United States, due to its association with [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], it was often called the "Tiffany style".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23"&gt;Duncan (1994): 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and Scandinavia, a related style emerged at about the same time; it was called ''Jugendstil'', after the popular German art magazine of that name.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;  In Austria and the neighboring countries then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], a similar style emerged, called ''Secessionsstil'' in German, ({{lang-hu|szecesszió}}, {{lang-cs|secese}}) or ''Wiener Jugendstil'', after the artists of the [[Vienna Secession]].

The style was called ''Modern'' (Модерн) in Russia and ''Nieuwe Kunst'' (new art) in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; In Spain the related style was known as ''Modernismo'', ''Modernisme'' (in Catalan), ''Arte joven'' ("young art"); and in Portugal ''Arte nova'' (new art). 

Some names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the Art Nouveau artists: ''Stile Floreal'' ("floral style") in France; ''Paling Stijl'' ("eel style") in the Netherlands;  and ''Wellenstil'' ("wave style") and ''Lilienstil'' ("lily style") in Germany.&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of [[William Morris]], and in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the lavish [[Peacock Room]] by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, including [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Heywood Sumner]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Alfred Gilbert]], and especially [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau'' (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the style combined several different tendencies. In architecture, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], a declared enemy of the historical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]]. In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'', he wrote, "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet le-Duc, ''Entretiens sur l'architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

The French painters [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]] played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. "I believe that before everything a painting must decorate", Denis wrote in 1891. "The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the colored surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions."&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''L'Écho de Paris'', 28 December 1891, cited in Bouillon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=26}}

Another important influence on the new style was [[Japonism]]: the wave of enthusiasm for Japanese [[woodblock printing]], particularly the works of [[Hiroshige]], [[Hokusai]], and [[Utagawa Kunisada]] which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising [[Siegfried Bing]] founded a monthly journal, ''Le Japon artistique'' in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including [[Gustav Klimt]]. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain,  jewelry, and furniture.

New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and color [[lithographs]], played an essential role in popularizing the new style. ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' in England, ''Arts et idèes'' and ''Art et décoration'' in France, and ''[[Jugend]]'' in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. [[Aubrey Beardsley]] in England, and [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Félix Vallotton]] achieved international recognition as illustrators.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=30}}

With the posters by [[Jules Cheret]] for dancer [[Loie Fuller]] in 1893, and by [[Alphonse Mucha]] for actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and other artists achieved international celebrity status.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Franco-German art dealer and publisher [[Siegfried Bing]] played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize [[Japonism]] in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Eugène Grasset]], which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Société nationale des beaux-arts]] in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at [[Rue de Provence|22 rue de Provence]] in Paris, the ''[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]'', devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect [[Henry Van de Velde]], one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' showed paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], glass from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Emile Gallé]], jewelry by [[René Lalique]], and posters by [[Aubrey Beardsley]]. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, "Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies."{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985}}

===Beginning of Art Nouveau architecture (1893–1898)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] by Victor Horta and the [[Bloemenwerf]] house by [[Henry Van de Velde]], were built in Brussels in 1893–1895. Both Horta and Van de Velde designed not only the houses, but also all of the interior decoration, furniture, carpets, and architectural details.

Horta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element became the stairway, beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=127}}

Van de Velde was by training a designer, not an architect, and collaborated with an architect on the plan of the [[Bloemenwerf]], the house that he built for himself. He was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly William Morris's Red House, and like them he designed all aspects of the building, including the furniture, wallpaper and carpets.

After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, [[Hector Guimard]] built the [[Castel Béranger]], the first Paris building in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under [[Napoleon III]] by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]. They welcomed Guimard's colorful and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new [[Paris Métro]] system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition Universelle'']].&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/hd_artn.htm Gontar, Cybele.

===Paris ''Exposition universelle'' (1900)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Paris 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition universelle'']] marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]: the main exhibit hall, the [[Grand Palais]] had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.

The Exposition particularly highlighted French designers, who all made special works for the Exhibition: [[Lalique]] crystal and jewelry; jewelry by [[Henri Vever]] and [[Georges Fouquet]]; [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] glass; the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] in [[porcelain]]; ceramics by [[Alexandre Bigot]]; sculpted glass lamps and vases by [[Emile Gallé]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and Company from the United States; furniture by [[Édouard Colonna]] and [[Louis Majorelle]]; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms from around Europe and the world. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, [[Siegfried Bing]] presented a pavilion called '' Art Nouveau Bing'', which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.&lt;ref name="eidelberg"&gt;Martin Eidelberg and Suzanne Henrion-Giele, "Horta and Bing: An Unwritten Episode of L'Art Nouveau", ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 119, Special Issue Devoted to European Art Since 1890 (Nov. 1977), pp. 747–752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncanbing"&gt;Duncan (1994), pp. 15–16, 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] marked the beginning of the [[Modernisme]] style in Spain, with some buildings of [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]]. The [[Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna (1902)|''Esposizione internazionale d'arte decorativa moderna'']] of 1902 in [[Turin]], Italy, showcased designers from across Europe.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by [[Jules Lavirotte]], who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the [[Lavirotte Building]], at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including ''[[Maxim's]]'' at [[Rue Royale, Paris|3 rue Royale]], and [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|''Le Train bleu'']] at the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1900).{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine]] became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the ''Alliance provinciale des industries d'art'', also known as the ''[[École de Nancy]]'', was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts.  The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators [[Emile Gallé]], the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] brothers in glass design, and the designer [[Louis Majorelle]], who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect [[Henri Sauvage]] brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his [[Villa Majorelle]] in 1898.

The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including ''The Studio'', ''Arts et Idées'' and ''Art et Décoration'', whose photographs and color lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.

In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion,  virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these continue to be manufactured in the style today.

Belgium was an early center of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of [[Victor Horta]], who designed the first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] in 1893, and the [[Hôtel Solvay]] in 1894. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of the young [[Hector Guimard]]. Other important designers included architect [[Paul Hankar]], who built an Art Nouveau house in 1893; the architect and furniture designer [[Henry van de Velde]], the decorator [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]], and the graphic artist [[Fernand Khnopff]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unescohorta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1005|title=Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of [[ivory]] imported from the [[Belgian Congo]]; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as [[Philippe Wolfers]], was popular.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

In the Netherlands, the style was known as the ''Nieuwe Kunst'', the New Art. Architects included [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], who designed a more functional, rational variant, while [[Carel Adolph Lion Cachet]], [[Theo Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof]] designed a more picturesque and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern [[Indonesia]]), while textiles were influenced by the designs and techniques of [[batik]].{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

Prominent Swiss artists of the period included painter and graphic artist [[Théophile Steinlen]], creator of the famous poster for the Paris [[cabaret]] [[Le Chat Noir|''Le Chat noir'']], and the artist, sculptor and decorator [[Eugène Grasset]], who moved from Switzerland to Paris where he designed graphics, furniture, tapestries, ceramics and posters. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (''École normale d'enseignement du dessin''), where his students included [[Augusto Giacometti]] and [[Paul Berthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan37"&gt;Duncan (1994), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the [[arts and crafts movement]] of the 1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function and nature. One notable early example [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of [[Sir Christopher Wren]], published in 1883.

Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers [[Aubrey Beardsley]] whose drawings featured the curved lines which became the most recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing [[wrought iron]] from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included [[Walter Crane]] and [[Charles Robert Ashbee|Charles Ashbee]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|title=Art Nouveau - Art Nouveau Art|date=22 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|archivedate=22 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] department store in London played an important role, through its colorful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewelry designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]. His jewelry designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewelry design.

For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important center in Britain was [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]], with the creations of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the [[Glasgow School]], whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]], a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the ''Glasgow Rose".{{Sfn|Lahor|page=160}}

[[Léon-Victor Solon]], made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in [[Tubelining|tube-lined]] vases marketed as "secessionist ware" (usually described as named after the [[Viennese Secession|Viennese art movement]]).&lt;ref name="Muter"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41809144 | title=Leon Solon and John Wadsworth | work=Journal of the Decorative Arts Society | year=1985 | author=Muter, Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Leek silk industry]]&lt;ref&gt;He was commissioned by the Wardle family of dyers and printers, trading as "Thomas Wardle &amp; Co" and "Bernard Wardle and Co".[http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ The Wardel Pattern Books Revealed]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044031/http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[doublure (bookbinding)|doublure]]s for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under Lyme), who patented the ''Sutherland'' binding in 1895.

The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the [[Former Everard's Printing Works|printing works of Edward Everard]], features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] and [[William Morris]], both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the "Spirit of Light", while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, ''Jugendstil''. The name is taken from the artistic journal, ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Die Jugend]]'', which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by [[Georg Hirth]] (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: ''Jugendstil'' ("youth style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts,&lt;ref&gt;A. Philip McMahon, "review of F. Schmalenbach, ''Jugendstil''", ''Parnassus'', vol. 7 (Oct., 1935), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the forms of organic [[typography]] and [[graphic design]] found in and influenced by German magazines like ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'', ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heller"&gt;Reinhold Heller, "Recent Scholarship on Vienna's "Golden Age", Gustav Klimt, and Egon Schiele", ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 59 (Mar., 1977), pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were [[Munich]] and [[Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt Artists' Colony|Mathildenhöhe]]).

Two other journals, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', published in Munich, and ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', published in Berlin, proved to be important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of ''Jugendstil'', especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] [[poster]]s. Designers often used unique display [[typeface]]s that worked harmoniously with the image.

One of the most famous German artists associated with both ''Die Jugend'' and ''Pan'' was [[Otto Eckmann]]. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the [[leitmotif]] for the Jugendstil.

One of the most prominent German designers in the style was [[Richard Riemerschmid]], who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=52}}

{{Main article|Vienna Secession}}
Vienna became the center of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]], an art movement that was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists which included [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], [[Max Kurzweil]], and [[Otto Wagner]]. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward [[historicism]] expressed by [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]], the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, ''[[Ver Sacrum]]'', to promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the ''Jugendstil'' in neighboring Germany.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=63}} The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists. The architectural style of the Vienna Secession had an influence well beyond the city. Buildings in the style appeared in the other major cities of the Empire and beyond; one of the most famous examples is the [[Stoclet Palace]] built by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels in 1905–11. The interior is entirely decorated in Secession style, including notable paintings by Gustav Klimt.

Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. [[Koloman Moser]] was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, furniture, and more. He often worked in collaboration with Hoffmann and Klimt; the three together created the interiors, furnishing and even clothing to be worn in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. In 1903, he and Hoffmann founded the [[Wiener Werkstätte]], a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the capitals of Central Europe, then ruled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in Vienna, national forms of Art Nouveau are quick to appear, and often took on historical or folkloric elements. The furniture designs of [[Ödön Faragó]] in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. [[Pál Horti]], another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.

[[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]], has a notable collection of Art Nouveau architecture, including the ''Hotel Central'' and the [[Jubilee Synagogue]], built in 1908.

The style of combining Art Nouveau and national architectural elements was typical also for a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] architect [[Dušan Jurkovič]] who was under the influence of Hungarian Art Nouveau. His most original works are the Cultural House in [[Skalica]] in [[Slovakia]] (1905), buildings of spa in [[Luhačovice]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (1901–1903) and 35 war cemeteries near [[Nowy Żmigród]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko ([[Rusyns|Rusyn]]) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917). Another example of Secession architecture in Slovakia is the [[Church of St. Elisabeth (Bratislava)|Church of St. Elisabeth]] (The Little Blue Church) in [[Bratislava]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Italy's ''Stile Liberty'' took its name from the British department store [[Liberty (store)|Liberty]], the colorful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers included [[Galileo Chini]], whose ceramics were inspired both by [[majolica]] patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas  ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'' and ''[[Turandot]]''.

The [[Teatro Massimo]] in [[Palermo]], by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]], is an example of the Italian variant of the style, architectural style, which combined Art Nouveau and classical elements.

The most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was [[Carlo Bugatti]], the son of an architect and sculptor, and brother of the famous automobile designer. He studied at the [[Brera Academy|Milanese Academy of Brera]], and later the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=310}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In Spain, a highly original variant of the style, Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]'', appeared in [[Barcelona]]. Its most famous creator was [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]], who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very novel way in ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1886).{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=142}}&lt;ref&gt;James Grady, ''Special Bibliographical Supplement: A Bibliography of the Art Nouveau'', in "The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", vol. 14 (May, 1955), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt; His designs from about 1903, the ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1904–1906) and ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (1906–1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan52"&gt;Duncan (1994): 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, famous structures such as the ''[[Sagrada Família]]'' characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist [[Neo-Gothic]].&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the [[Castell dels Tres Dragons]] (1888), [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] and [[Casa Lleó Morera]] (1905).&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Another major modernista was [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], who designed the [[Casa Martí]] and its Quatre Gats café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the [[Caixa Forum|CaixaFòrum]] art museum), Casa Macaya, [[Casa Amatller]], the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa de les Punxes ("House of Spikes"). Also well-known is [[Josep Maria Jujol]], with houses in [[Sant Joan Despí]] (1913–1926), several churches near [[Tarragona]] (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in [[Barcelona]]. A few other major architects working outside of Barcelona were Lluís Muncunill i Parellada, with a magnificent textile factory in [[Terrassa]] (Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover, now the Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia – Museu de la Ciència i de la Tècnica de Catalunya) and a "farmhouse"/small manor house called Masia Freixa in the same city; and [[Cèsar Martinell i Brunet]], with his spectacular "wine cathedrals", housing town cooperative wineries throughout southern and central [[Catalonia]]. A [[Valencian Country|Valencian]] architect who worked in Catalonia before emigrating to the [[United States|States]] was [[Rafael Guastavino]]. Attributed to him is the Asland Cement Factory in [[Castellar de n'Hug]], among other buildings.

The Catalan furniture designer Gaspar Homar (1870–1953), influenced by Antoni Gaudí, often combining marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=311}} Examples of Art Nouveau (''Arte nova''), based largely on the French model, appeared in Portugal in [[Porto]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].  A notable example is the '[[Livraria Lello]]' bookstore in [[Porto]], designed by Xavier Esteves (1906).

Art Nouveau was popular in the [[Nordic countries]], where it was usually known as [[Jugendstil]], and was often combined with the [[National Romantic Style]] of each country. In [[Norway]] the Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by [[Viking]] folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and [[Celts|Celtic]] patterns, and [[Gerhard Munthe]], who designed a chair with a stylized dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}} Other examples include the [[Skien Church]] (1887–1894) and [[Fagerborg Church]] in [[Kristiania]] (Oslo) (1900–1903).

In [[Finland]], good examples are the [[Helsinki Central railway station]], designed by [[Eliel Saarinen]], father of the famous American modernist architect [[Eero Saarinen]]. Examples of the style include the [[Finnish National Theatre]], [[Kallio Church]], the [[Finnish National Museum]], and [[Tampere Cathedral]]. In contrast to the very elaborate furniture of the Norwegian Art Nouveau, Finnish Art Deco was extremely simple and functional, as in the chairs designed by Eliel Saarinen (1907-1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/article/the-charm-of-old-helsinki/|title=The Charm of Old Helsinki — VisitFinland.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnouveau.eu/en/city.php?id=136|title=Art Nouveau European Route : Cities|website=www.artnouveau.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A very colorful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, "Мир искусства" (transliteration: ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'') ("The World of Art"), by Russian artists [[Alexandre Benois]] and [[Léon Bakst]], and chief editor [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Konstantin Somov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], and the book illustrator [[Ivan Bilibin]]. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colors and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the "World of Art" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new ballet company, the ''[[Ballets Russes]]'', headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colorful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, ''[[L'Illustration]]'', [[La Vie Parisienne (magazine)|''La Vie parisienne'']] and [[Gazette du Bon Ton|''Gazette du bon ton'']], and the Russian style became known in Paris as ''à la Bakst''. The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alistair, ''Art déco'', Thames and Hudson (1988), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] have several prominent Art Nouveau buildings constructed in the last years before the Revolution; notably the [[Hotel Metropol (Moscow)|Hotel Metropol]] in Moscow, which features a ceramic mural on the façade, ''The Princess of Dreams'', by scenic designer [[Mikhail Vrubel]];  and the [[Vitebsk Railway Station]] in Saint Petersburg (1904)

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the United States, the firm of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]] in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its coloring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and coloring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of color In 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of [[Thomas Edison]], he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicolored glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewelry. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''1900 Exposition Universelle'']] in Paris; his stained glass window called the ''Flight of Souls'' won a gold medal.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=167}}

Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect [[Louis Sullivan]], best known as the architect of some of the first American iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned ''White City'', he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display at the [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]].

==Form and character==
[[File:Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen - Tournée du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis (Tour of Rodolphe Salis' Chat Noir) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''La tournée du Chat noir de Rodolphe Salis'' (1896) by [[Théophile Steinlen]]]]

Although Art Nouveau acquired distinctly localised tendencies as its geographic spread increased, some general characteristics are indicative of the form. A description published in ''Pan'' magazine of [[Hermann Obrist]]'s wall hanging ''Cyclamen'' (1894) described it as "sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip", which became well known during the early spread of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan27"&gt;Duncan (1994): 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, not only did the work itself become better known as ''The Whiplash'' but the term "whiplash" is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists.&lt;ref name="duncan27" /&gt; Such decorative "whiplash" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.

The origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the artist [[William Morris]] to the cluttered compositions and the [[Gothic revival|revival]] tendencies of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the [[Arts and crafts movement]].&lt;ref name="duncan10"&gt;Duncan (1994): 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s book-cover for ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s City Churches'' (1883), with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first realisation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan10" /&gt; About the same time, the flat perspective and strong colors of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block prints]], especially those of [[Katsushika Hokusai]], had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan14"&gt;Duncan (1994): 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Japonisme]]'' that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references to the natural world.&lt;ref name ="duncan14" /&gt; Besides being adopted by artists like [[Emile Gallé]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], Japanese-inspired art and design was championed by the businessmen [[Siegfried Bing]] and [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]] at their stores&lt;ref&gt;Before opening the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'', Bing managed a shop specialising in items from Japan; after 1888, he promoted Japanism with his magazine [[Artistic Japan|''Le Japon artistique'']]: Duncan (1994): 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris and London, respectively.&lt;ref name="duncan14" /&gt; &lt;!--If confirmed: "One of the first Art Nouveau paintings can be found at [[Roquetaillade castle]] (France). [[Viollet-le-Duc]] restored the castle during the 1850s, and, even though his ideal was to create a [[Gothic revival]], his [[fresco]] in the keep of the castle is a pure example of "pre" Art Nouveau style—organic movement and color. "--&gt;

In architecture, [[hyperbola]]s and [[parabola]]s in windows, arches, and doors are common, and decorative [[:molding (decorative)|mouldings]] 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau in architecture and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival styles of the 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' some of the more abstract elements of [[Rococo]] style, such as [[flame]] and [[Animal shell|shell]] textures, they also advocated the use of very stylised organic forms as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use [[seaweed]], [[grass]]es, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century [[auricular style]], best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.

==Relationship with contemporary styles and movements==
[[File:Gustav Klimt, 1907, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Neue Galerie New York.jpg|thumb|left|upright0.1||''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' by [[Gustav Klimt]] (1907)]]
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] styles, and artists like [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Jan Toorop]] could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the [[artisan]]-oriented [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and [[abstraction]] in the service of pure design.

Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726155845/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }} Edmond Lachenal produced editions of Rodin's sculptures&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau architecture made use of many [[technology|technological]] innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.
 
Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In [[Denmark]], for example, it was one aspect of ''Skønvirke'' ("aesthetic work"), which itself more closely relates to the [[Arts and Crafts style]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Opie, ''A Dish by Thorvald Bindesbøll'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 132 (May, 1990), pp. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Selkurt, "New Classicism: Design of the 1920s in Denmark", in ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 4 (Spring, 1987), pp. 16–29 (esp. 18 n. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the ''[[Młoda Polska]]'' ("Young Poland") style in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Danuta A. Boczar, ''The Polish Poster'', in ''Art Journal'', vol. 44 (Spring, 1984), pp. 16–27 (esp. 16).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Młoda Polska'', however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Batorska, "Zofia Stryjeńska: Princess of Polish Painting", in ''Woman's Art Journal'', vol. 19 (Autumn, 1998–Winter, 1999), pp. 24–29 (esp. 24–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly color [[lithography]] which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.

In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]] (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', then black and white illustrations for [[Salome]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine ''The Studio'', which helped publicize European artists such as [[Fernand Khnopff]] in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=99}}

The Swiss-French artist [[Eugène Grasset]] (1845-1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret [[Le Chat Noir|Le Chat noir]] in 1885 and made his first posters for the ''Fêtes de Paris''. He made a celebrated posters of [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers [[Jules Chéret]], [[Georges de Feure]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play ''[[Gismonda]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]]. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewelry for the actress.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;''[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/praguepage/muchalecture.htm An Introduction to the Work of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau]'', lecture by [[Ian Johnston (academic)|Ian Johnston]] of [[Malaspina University-College]], [[Nanaimo]], British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Julie. H. [http://www.style2000.com/p05b.html "Recycling art"] style2000.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure.  He went on to design products, from jewelry to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=112}}

In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was [[Koloman Moser]] (1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Josef Hoffmann]], and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, ''Ver Sacrum'', as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.{{Sfn|Lahor|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Painting was another important domain of Art Nouveau, though most Art Nouveau painters were also associated with other art movements, particularly the [[Nabis]] in France and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] in France and Austria. In 1892, [[Siegfried Bing]] organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven painters, including [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], and [[Maurice Denis]]; and his ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' exhibited paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Koloman Moser]] and [[Gustav Klimt]] moved comfortably in the avant-garde and Art Nouveau. In Belgium, [[Fernand Khnopff]] worked in both painting and graphic design. Paintings by Gustav Klimt were an integral part of he decorative scheme of [[Josef Hoffmann]] for the [[Palais Stoclet]]. One common theme of both symbolist and Art Nouveau painters of the period was the stylized depiction of women. One popular subject was the American dancer [[Loie Fuller]], portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau (1870-1914)'', Skira, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass art]] was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which permitted production in series. The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of [[Emile Gallé]] and the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] studio, led by [[Auguste Daum|Auguste]] and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including [[Ernest Bussière]], [[Henri Bergé]], and [[Amalric Walter]]. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]], whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the [[Villa Majorelle]] and other houses.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=318}}

In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of [[Val Saint Lambert]], which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by [[Philippe Wolfers]]. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of [[symbolist]] glass, often with metal decoration attached. In [[Bohemia]], then a region of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] noted for crystal manufacture, the companies [[Lobmeyr]] and [[Loetz-Witwe]] also experimented with new coloring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colors. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; [[Otto Prutscher]] was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] for the architectural display called "The House of an Art Lover."

In the United States, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of coloring glass, patenting in 1894 the process [[Favrile glass]], which used metallic oxides to color the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the [[Tiffany lamp]] in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by [[Siegfried Bing]], and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, [[Steuben Glass]], was founded in 1903 in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, NY]], by [[Frederick Carder]], who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colors. Another notable American glass artist was [[John La Farge]], who created intricate and colorful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

The 19th-century architectural theorist [[Viollet-le-Duc]] had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects [[Victor Horta]] and [[Hector Guimard]] went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=322}}

In the United States, the designer [[George Grant Elmslie]] made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect [[Louis Sullivan]].

While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]] and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=324}}

Art Nouveau is characterized done by soft, curved shapes and lines, and usually features natural designs such as flowers, birds and other animals. The female body is a popular theme and is featured on a variety of jewelry pieces, especially cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of [[amethyst]], [[peridot]], or [[citrine quartz|citrine]].&lt;ref name="Art Nouveau Jewelry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/fine-jewelry/art-nouveau|title=Art Nouveau Jewelry|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewelry industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewelry had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewelers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including [[agate]], [[garnet]] [[opal]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]] and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others [[vitreous enamel|enameling]], and new materials, including [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], molded glass, and [[ivory]].

Early notable Paris jewelers in the Art Nouveau style included [[Louis Aucoc]], whose family jewelry firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, [[René Lalique]], served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewelry and glass, using nature, from [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] to grasses, as his model. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as [[Paul Follot]], best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included [[Jules Brateau]] and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work was shown at the shop of [[Siegfried Bing]] and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty &amp; Co. designer [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. [[C. R. Ashbee]] designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile [[Glasgow]] designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the center for ''Jugendstil'' jewelry was the city of [[Pforzheim]], where most of the German firms, including [[Theodor Fahrner]], were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

The style first appeared in Brussels' [[Hôtel Tassel]] (1894) and [[Hôtel Solvay]] (1900) of [[Victor Horta]]. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by [[Hector Guimard]], who used the same style in his first major work, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1897–98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new [[Paris Métro]], which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.

In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building facades by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], the prefect of Paris under [[Napoleon III]]. [[Bow window]]s were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of [[Jules Lavirotte]], which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighborhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], around the [[Villa Majorelle]] (1901–02), the residence of furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]]. It was designed by [[Henri Sauvage]] as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings;  the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.

In France, the center for furniture design and manufacture was in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], where two major designers, [[Émile Gallé]] and [[Louis Majorelle]] had their studios and workshops, and where the ''Alliance des industries d'art'' (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of [[marquetry]] in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included [[Eugène Vallin]] and [[Émile André]]; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other notable French designers included [[Henri Bellery-Desfontaines]], who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]; and [[Georges de Feure]], [[Eugène Gaillard]], and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for "abstract naturalism", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its [[rococo]] influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was [[François-Rupert Carabin]], a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Other influential Paris furniture designers were [[Charles Plumet]], and [[Alexandre Charpentier]].{{sfn|Riley|2007|page=302}}  In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century [[Rococo]] furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the ''Art Nouveau movement'', [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]], designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration.  The Belgian designer [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called ''Nieuwe Kunst'' or New Art, H.P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, with more geometric rational forms.

In Britain, the furniture of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration.&lt;ref name="Lucie-Smith, 160"&gt;Lucie-Smith, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of [[Peter Behrens]] and the [[Jugendstil]] was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] in Vienna, led by [[Otto Wagner]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], Josef Maria Olbrich and [[Koloman Moser]]. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the [[Biedemeier]] style.{{Sfn|RIley|2007|page=308}}
 
Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. [[Carlo Bugatti]] in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of [[Antoni Gaudi]] and the ''Modernismo'' movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was [[Charles Rohlfs]] in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of [[Celtic Art]] and [[Gothic art]], with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (''grand feu'') porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional [[Stoneware|''grés'']] methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, [[Jules Lavirotte]] and [[Hector Guimard]] among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of [[Alexandre Bigot]], giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|pages=314-15}}

One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was [[Ernest Chaplet]], whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter [[Paul Gauguin]] on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors [[Félix Bracquemond]], [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.

The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] outside Paris; [[Nymphenburg]], [[Meissen]], [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]] in Germany, and [[Doulton Industrial Products|Doulton]] in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included [[Taxile Doat]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Adrien Dalpayrat|fr}}, [[Edmond Lachenal]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Dammouse|fr}} and [[Auguste Delaherche]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edmond Lachenal and His Legacy'', by Martin Eidelberg, Claire Cass, Hudson Hills Press; illustrated edition (25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine ''Dancer with a Scarf'' by [[Agathon Léonard]], made for the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]], won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

The [[Zsolnay|Zsolnay factory]] in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]], was led by [[Miklós Zsolnay]] (1800–1880) and his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900,) with [[Tádé Sikorski]] (1852–1940) chief designer, to produce stoneware and other ceramics in 1853. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of [[eosin]]. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 World Fair in Vienna]], then at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 World Fair in Paris]], where Zsolnay received a ''Grand Prix''. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magyarkeramia.hu/keramia/zsolnay/page_en.html Timeline], accessed 1/23/08&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs o[[William Morris]] had helped launch the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty department store]] in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the [[Silver Studio]], which provided colorful stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from [[Glasgow School]], and [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]]. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the "Rose of Glasgow".

In France, a major contribution was made by designer [[Eugène Grasset]] who in 1896 published ''La Plante et ses applications ornamentales'', suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer [[Hermann Obrist]]  specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the "whiplash" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian [[Henry van de Velde]] presented a textile work, ''La Veillée d'Anges'', at the Salon ''La Libre Esthéthique'' in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of [[Paul Gauguin]] and of the [[Nabis]]. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by [[batik]] patterns from the Dutch colonies in the [[East Indies]]. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of [[Gerhard Munthe]] and [[Frida Hansen]] in Norway. The ''Five Swans'' design of [[Otto Eckmann]] appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer [[János Vaszary]] combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=328}}

The '''Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival''' or '''FICEB''' (''Festival Internacional de Cinema Eròtic de Barcelona'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is an annual [[Spain|Spanish]] [[pornographic film]] [[film festival|festival]] and awards ceremony. It is the oldest adult film festival in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="2007 Barcelona Film Fest Winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xfanz.com/news/84958 |title=Barcelona Film Fest Winners|date=9 October 2007|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Horror on the Rhine''' refers to a moral panic which was aroused in Germany concerning allegations of widespread war crimes, especially sexual war crimes, said to be committed by [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese]] and other African soldiers serving in the French Army during the French [[occupation of the Rhineland]] between 1918-1930.

==Background==
[[File:Reims-Armée noire(1924).jpg|thumb|right|"To the heros of the Black Army": Monument to Senegalese soldiers of the French army who successfully defended [[Reims]] in July 1918]]
Following the [[Kiel Mutiny]] on 3 November 1918, revolutionary sailors visited numerous cities across Germany announcing the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]]. The German Army had already been experiencing a series of mutinies, particularly since the failure of the German [[Spring offensive]] which was brought to a halt in July 1918. Soldiers from the French [[Colonial army]] played a significant role in defending the city of [[Reims]] which was under siege during the German attack. As one German writer put it "It is not the French fighting at Reims. France has entrusted the protection of the ancient city of coronation to black and brown soldiers. It is true that the defence of Reims does not cost a drop of French blood, it is Negroes who are sacrificed."&lt;ref name="TDM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Troupes De Marine: Les coloniaux sauvent REIMS en 1918|url=https://www.troupesdemarine.org/traditions/histoire/hist010.htm|website=www.troupesdemarine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the evening of 6 November 200 revolutionary soldiers had reached the city of [[Cologne]], where they joined local workers and soldiers to establish a Workers and Soldiers' Council, along the lines of the Russian [[soviets]]. When reports of this reached [[Wilhelm Groener]], Deputy Chief of Staff of the [[Imperial German Army]] he no longer supported the [[Wilhelm II]]'s plan to instigate a civil war, but rather joined the call of [[Friedrich Ebert]], leader of the [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (MSPD) for the Kaiser to abdicate. This the Kaiser did on 9 November, and Ebert became [[Chancellor of Germany]] the same day. The MSPD became active in opposing the revolution and worked with the army to establish a [[Republic#Liberal republics|liberal republic]].

Thus the [[Rhineland]] had played a significant role in toppling the Kaiser and obliging the German state to accept the armistice. Likewise, the African soldiers of the French Army played a significant role in the defeat of the [[Imperial German Army]] in the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. This battle which was a decisive victory for the allies, saw the French Army using a massed tank attack alongside forces of its [[Troupes coloniales|colonial army]]. Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] wrote in his 1920 memoirs ''Mein Leben'': "Where there were no tanks our enemy sent black waves against us. Waves of black Africans! Woe to us when these waves reached our lines and massacred or worse, tortured our defenseless men!"{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=608}} Notwithstanding this somewhat odd remark by the [[German General Staff#German General Staff|Chief of the German General Staff]], the highly armed German Army used [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]] in attacks on French Colonial Troops in the [[Battle of Reims (1918)|battle of Reims]]. The American historian Keith Nelson considers Hindenburg's view of the Senegalese as typical of German views of the Senegalese, and claims there is evidence to suggest that many German soldiers were reluctant to surrender to the Senegalese out of the belief that they would be eaten as racist propaganda that the Senegalese were cannibals from "darkest Africa" was widely believed.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=608}}{{sfn|Fraser|1989|p=13}}

==French use of colonial troops==
Following the defeat of the [[Second French Empire]] by the Prussians in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870/1, a current of [[revanchism]] developed in France which sought to regain the lost territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] which had been ceded to the newly formed [[German Empire]]. Thus politicians such as [[Georges Clemenceau]], of the [[Radical Party (France)#Radicals before the party (1830–1901)|Radical Republicans]], opposed participation in the [[scramble for Africa]] as they were concern it would divert the Republic from objectives related regaining Alsace-Lorraine. Nevertheless, French officers repeatedly ignored orders, as they lead the French Army on various campaigns in Africa. [[Charles Mangin]], a career officer in the French Army with campaign experience in Africa set out to resolve these conflicting imperialist strategies in his book his 1910 book ''La force noire'' (''The Black Force'') He argued that as Germany had a greater population and a higher birth rate than France in the early 20th century this meant that the German Army was potentially going to be larger than the French Army. He proposed that the French had recruited extensively from their African colonies to provide an almost limitless source of manpower that could counter Germany's numerical superiority.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=607}} Thus the expansion of the [[French colonial empire#1870-1939|French colonial empire]] could be seen as complementing rather than competing with the desire to oblige Germany to return the lost territory.

===Political dilemma of citizenship for French colonial soldiers===
[[File:7e RTA est son drapeau en 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the [[7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment]] in 1917]]
One of the products of the [[French revolution]] was a concept of the nation linked to citizenship and military service. The [[levée en masse]] or forced mass [[conscription|military conscription]] was introduced in 1793 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref name="Fogarty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogarty|first1=Richard S.|title=Race and War in France: Colonial Subjects in the French Army, 1914–1918|date=2008|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801888243|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=28Pd4ZoFKSgC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=race+legislation+France+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5UO_PcR50_&amp;sig=JCZx0boThOsC-33wmcHmw6N4vi0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigx_S13_naAhVpCMAKHbvdC2k4ChDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=race%20legislation%20France%201914&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the demand that by serving in the French Army, colonial subjects should gain full French citizenship. However whilst military service provided a very clear expression of political allegiance to the state, French society had developed the idea of the [[statut personnel]] by which particularly French Muslims would have a distinct status, being governed by [[Koranic law]] administered by local religious authorities.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; As the norms of Islam permitted [[polygamy]], this created what were considered insurmountable problems by those who defended an [[assimilationist]] viewpoint. Many of the assimilationists saw the culture and civilisation of France as something far superior to what they regarded as the barbaric customs of their non-European subjects. Another political current, the associationists advocated something along the lines of [[indirect rule]]  as practised by the [[British Empire]]. They saw the colonised subjects as having to find their own path to civilisation and relied on local elites to manage the colonial system on the ground.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Martin|title=The French Empire Between the Wars: Imperialism, Politics and Society|date=2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719077555|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXrXQU33avQC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=French+associationism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eM2SUTCP4M&amp;sig=Z85HfetQ5mINyOIWU8Rc25gT0OA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9mM_vwvraAhWkDMAKHY-sCXUQ6AEIQTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20associationism&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both, however, viewed the subject peoples as being in debt to their conquerors, who by dominating them offered the allegedly profound benefits of French culture.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; Thus, despite the egalitarian ideology of the [[French Third Republic]] – which would theoretically exclude any [[Color line (racism)|color line]] – the development of French colonies created a quite different reality.

===Election of Blaise Diagne===
[[Image:Blaise Diagne-1921.jpg|thumb|right|Blaise Diagne, Sengalese champion of citizenship for military service]]
However the election of [[Blaise Diagne]] in February 1914 provided a champion for the demand of citizenship rights for colonial soldiers. Diagne represented the [[Four Communes]], the four oldest colonial towns in [[French West Africa]] which had won the right to send deputies to the [[Chamber of Deputies]] following the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 revolution]].
Within the ideology of the republic, having Africans and Asians fighting in the French Army was proof of the universalism of French civilization which was open to all. Unlike the British who sent an Indian Army corps to the Western Front in October 1914, which was pulled out in 1916 once there were enough white divisions to replace the Indians, the French kept their Algerian, Tunisian, Moroccan, Senegalese, Malagasy and Vietnamese divisions on the front-line right to the end of war. Through in practice, there was a color line in France, within the context of the times France was a nation that was relatively open to non-white people with for example the African-American singer [[Josephine Baker]] finding a degree of acceptance in France that she never found in her own country. The French called anyone from French West Africa "Senegalese" regardless if they actually came from Senegal or not; many of the "Senegalese" were not from Senegal.

Through Germany had also recruited soldiers in its African colonies both before and during World War I, the British blockade prevented any ''Askaris'' from fighting in Europe for Germany.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=607-608}} During the war, German propaganda had often attacked the French for deploying African soldiers to fight in Europe, claiming that black men were innately savage and barbaric and it was unacceptable for the French to use Senegalese soldiers in Europe as it "endangered" European civilization.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=608}}

Under the terms of the armistice which ended the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on 11 November 1918, the Allies had the right to occupy the Rhineland, and during the negotiations the Germans had specifically demanded that no Senegalese be included in the French occupation force.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=609}} However, as the terms of the armistice were dictated to the Germans, this was of little import. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919, the Allies had the right to occupy the Rhineland until 1935, through in fact the last Allied forces were pulled out of the Rhineland in June 1930. The German fears of the Senegalese were widely shared amongst [[white people]] in the English-speaking world, and both the U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] asked the French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] that no Senegalese being used as occupation troops in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=609-610}}

==Non-European troops arrive==
The first non-European troops to arrive in Germany were soldiers from the [[Siamese Expeditionary Forces]] who arrived in [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße|Neustadt]], in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] in December 1918. However, their presence which lasted until July 1919 did not cause great upset. Concerns were raised about the subsequent arrival of African troops in the Rhineland, first a regiment from Madagascar, and then the first Senegalese unit in May 1919.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=611}} General Mangin had gone out of his way to ensure that African units were stationed as part of the Rhineland occupation force.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=611}} The French deployed African soldiers to the Rhineland in part as not to ensure that build-up of black troops in France, and partly because the Germans had asked them not to be deployed.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=612-613}} Mangin had insisted since the French were the victors, they were not going to be dictated to by the vanquished.For Diagne it was important that his fellow Senegalese be deployed to the Rhineland as a way of showing that they were equal and enjoyed the same respect as white French citizens.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=80}} In a meeting with Clemenceau, Diagne had insisted that if French civilization was truly universal, then the Senegalese should allowed to march into the Rhineland alongside the rest of the French Army and not be excluded simply because the Germans found them offensive.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=80}} The Francophile Diagne, who believed in the ideal of France's "civilizing mission" in Africa, had played a key role in the recruitment soldiers in Senegal to fight for France, and thus had more influence than what his position as a mere Deputy might suggest. The "colored" troops in the Rhineland were conscripts from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Madagascar and Vietnam.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} At their peak, the "colored" soldiers were 14% of the French occupation force in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} On 1 August 1919, an ultra-nationalist group called the ''[[Rheinische Volkspflege]]'' (Protectors of the Rhenish People) was founded with the purpose of seeking to turn public opinion against French support for the Rhenish separatism, and who hit upon the idea of using alleged crimes committed by blacks serving in the French Army as the best way to do so.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} Closely allied to the ''Rheinische Volkspflege'' was the woman's group, the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' which was founded in early 1920.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} The articles published by the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' articulated "fantastical visions of imperialism and cultural decline" as the mass rapes alleged to be committed by the Senegalese became a metaphor for Franco-German relations.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=475}}

==''Rheinische Volkspflege'' and ''Rheinische Frauenliga''==
On 1 August 1919, an ultra-nationalist group called the ''[[Rheinische Volkspflege]]'' (Protectors of the Rhenish People) was founded with the purpose of seeking to turn public opinion against French support for the Rhenish separatism, and who hit upon the idea of using alleged crimes committed by blacks serving in the French Army as the best way to do so.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} Closely allied to the ''Rheinische Volkspflege'' was the woman's group, the ''[[Rheinische Frauenliga]]'' which was founded in early 1920.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} The articles published by the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' articulated "fantastical visions of imperialism and cultural decline" as the mass rapes alleged to be committed by the Senegalese became a metaphor for Franco-German relations.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=475}}
The  ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' was in very close contact with [[E. D. Morel]]–a leading British radical liberal and an advocate of the viewpoint that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany–and much of Morel's writings on the issue was based on reports provided to him by the ''Rheinische Frauenliga''.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=475}} Morel, a white supremacist who was obsessed with a fear of the sexuality of black men, genuinely believed that black men had an uncontrolled sexuality that made them want to rape white women with abandon, and throughout his writings on the subject he accused the Senegalese of raping German women on an industrial scale, claiming that thousands upon thousands of German women and girls were raped by the Senegalese on a daily basis.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=476}} The African-American historian [[Clarence Lusance]] accused Morel of leading "one of the most racist political campaigns to be launched in the first half of the 20th century".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=476}}

==Responses to the Kapp Putsch==
[[File:3e ri entrait à Francfort Illustration 1920.JPG|The band of the [[3rd Moroccan Tirailleurs Regiment]] of the French Army as they marched into Frankfurt 6 April 1920|thumb|right]]
There was political turmoil in Germany when it came to signing the Versailles Treaty. In June 1919 [[Philipp Scheidemann]], the first democratically elected [[Chancellor of Germany]] resigned when faced with allied ultimatum that it should be signed with none of the changes the German government had requested. His was succeeded as Chancellor by [[Gustav Bauer]]. The terms of the treaty meant that the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[Freikorps]] which the [[Weimar government]] had created to crush the [[revolutionary movement]] faced being disbanded. Rather than submit to this, [[Wolfgang Kapp]] gathered significant Army officers around him and launched the [[Kapp Putsch]]. The success of the Putsch would open up a possibility of a recommencement of the First World War, a fact not lost on [[Marshal Foch]].

Initially, there were only a few complaints from the German side about the presence of the Senegalese in the Rhineland, and not until April 1920 when the French used Moroccan soldiers to [[French occupation of Frankfurt|occupy Frankfurt]] that a hysterical campaign against the French use of "colored" soldiers began in Germany.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=614}} The issue of the deployment of "colored" troops was first discussed in the ''Reichstag'' in January 1920.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} Ray Beveridge, a German-American woman living in Germany had given a series of speeches in Hamburg and Munich in February–March 1920 warning of the dangers of miscegenation  to "the purity of the German race" caused by the presence of the Senegalese in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=476}} E.D. Morel had written in a letter to the editor of ''The Nation'' on 27 March 1920 about the French who "thrust barbarians–barbarians belonging to a race inspired by Nature with tremendous sexual instincts into the heart of Europe".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}}

In early April 1920, Germany violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by sending the ''Reichswehr'' into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, which led the French to occupy Frankfurt on 6 April 1920  as a reprisal, saying that they would not leave Germany's business capital until the ''Reichswehr'' left the demilitarized zone.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} One of the French Army units involved in occupying Frankfurt was a Moroccan company that fired into a crowd of demonstrators.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} Under the front-page of ''The Daily Herald'' on 9 April 1920, there was a cover story reporting on the occupation of Frankfort by Morel whose title read: "Frankfurt runs red with blood French Blood Troops Use Machine-guns on Civilians".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} The next day another front-page article by Morel had the title: "Black Scourge In Europe Sexual Horror Let Loose by France On Rhine Disappearance of Young German Girls".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} Morel wrote France is "thrusting her black savages into the heart of Germany", saying these "primitive African savages, the carriers of syphilis, have become a horror and a terror".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} As Morel was a man whose left-wing "credentials were unimpeachable" as he had gone to prison for opposing British involvement in the First World, his articles attracted much attention both in Britain and abroad.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=2}} Like many other British leftists, Morel was bitterly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles which denounced as an unjust treaty which he blamed on a revanchist France.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3}}

In his 1919 book ''The Black's Man Burden'', Morel had denounced mandate system of the Treaty of Versailles for the former German colonies Africa, writing that black people could not survive "modern capitalist exploitation".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3}} Morel wrote that "French militarists, whose schemes are a menace to the entire world" would use these "Negroes, Malagasies, Berbers and Arabs...in the interest of a capitalist and militant Order".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3}} Specifically, Morel believed the French would use their African troops to put down strikes by the white working classes in Europe, and the theme of the French Army's Senegalese soldiers are as a brutal force upholding capitalism was a recurring one in Morel's articles in ''The Daily Herald'' in 1919 and 1920.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3-4}} Given Morel's views about the Senegalese and his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, he was predisposed to believe any horror story that might come out of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=4}}

The ''Auswärtige Amt'' saw a chance to turn international opinion against France over this issue, and in April 1920 began a sustained propaganda campaign against the French use of "colored" troops.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' issued "talking points" to German newspapers, which all through the spring of 1920 ran front-page stories accusing the Senegalese of sorts of atrocities against German civilians.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}} The stories about the ''Die schwarze Schand'' ("the black shame") appeared frequently in the German press in the spring of 1920, running what Nelson called hysterical stories with "astonishing" frequency.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}} The German [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany|MSPD]] chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] in a speech complained that "Senegalese Negroes occupy the University of Frankfort and guard the Goethe House!"{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} The Foreign Minister, Dr. [[Adolf Köster]], in a note to the Allied governments wrote: "if we should suffer from the occupation, we will accept the inferior discipline...among your white troops if only you we will rid us of this black plague!"{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} 
[[File:Black Scourge in Europe Daily Herald April 10 1920.png|thumb|right|Morel's article in ''The Daily Herald'' on 10 April 1920 titled Black Scourge in Europe]]
Morel had published in the left-wing newspaper ''The Daily Herald'' on 10 April his "indictment of the colored outrages" in the Rhineland, which attracted much attention.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} Morel wrote about the Senegalese soldiers that during the First World War  "primitive African barbarians...stuffed their haversacks with eye-balls, ears and heads of the foe".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} Morel went on to write about "barely restrainable bestiality of the black troops" and depicted the Senegalese in the Rhineland as engaging in a reign of terror against German civilians, raping and killing without mercy.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} In an appeal to his female readers, Morel asked the question: "is there no obligation laid upon womenhood as such, in a matter of this kind which goes to the very root of any decent instinct the war may have left alive among the white peoples of the earth?"{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} Morel wrote that "black savages" have uncontrolled sexual impulses that ''"must be satisfied upon the bodies of white women!''" (emphasis in the original).{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=73}}  Despite his claim not to hate black people, Morel wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There they [the African soldiers] have become a terror and a horror unimaginable to the countryside, raping girls and women-for well known physiological reasons, the raping of a white woman by a negro is nearly always accompanied by serious injuries and not infrequently has fatal results; spreading syphilis, murdering inoffensive civilians, often getting completely out of control; the terrible barbaric incarnation of a barbarous policy, embodied in a so-called peace treaty which puts the clock back 2, 000 years".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=484}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a leader (editorial) written by the editor of ''The Daily Herald'', [[George Lansbury]], approved of Morel's article and asked that France pull all African troops out of the Rhineland at once.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} On 12 April 1920, Lansbury wrote again on the subject, saying if the French did not sent the Senegalese back to Africa at once, "we shall have savages used to blackleg, and to coerce, the workers of all European countries".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} On the same day, ''The Daily Herald'''s headlines read: "Brutes in French Uniforms Danger to German women from 30, 000 Blacks Brothels not enough".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=6}} The Central Committee of Women's Co-operative Guild in a statement expressed its "horror and indignation" at the use of Senegalese troops in the Rhineland, asked the British government pressure the French government to send all African troops back to Africa and called for an international agreement to ban "the use of any native African troops by any European power".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=478}} On 27 April 1920, a mass protest meeting was held in London that was organised jointly by all of the main British feminist groups, namely the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[National Federation of Women Workers]], the Federation of Women Teachers, the [[Women's Co-operative Guild]], the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries and the Fabian Women's Group to condemn France for the alleged war crimes committed by the Senegalese.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=478}} At the meeting, Morel asked: that in the interests of good feeling between all the races of the world and the security of all women, this
meeting calls upon the League of Nations to prohibit the importation into Europe for warlike purposes of troops belonging to primitive peoples."{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=50}}

[[Claude McKay]], the Jamaican writer and [[industrial unionism|industrial unionist]] who had arrived in London several months earlier, wrote a letter to ''The Daily Herald'', which was not published, asking:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper?" Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn't make it different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis. If Negro troops had syphilis, they contracted it from the white and yellow races. As for German women, in their economic plight they were selling themselves to anyone. I do not protest because I happen to be a Negro...I write because I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and the many members of my race...who have been dumped down on the English docks since the ending of the European war...Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-Socialist pacifist ''Daily Herald''.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=17}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Another letter to the editor of ''The Daily Herald'' which was published on 17 April 1920 came from the africanist [[Norman Leys]] and criticized Morel for "his so-called physiological facts", which are "one of the great sources for racial hatred and should never be given currency".'{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=17}}

Morel's article received much attention and 50, 000 Swedish women signed a petition which was presented at the French Embassy in Stockholm asking the French to withdraw their "savage" Senegalese soldiers from the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} In an article in ''The Labour Leader'' on 22 April 1920, Morel wrote the African soldiers were the "passively obedient instrument of capitalist society" and a threat to the working classes of the nations of Europe.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=4}} Reflecting his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, Morel blamed the "black horror" on the French who deliberately committed this "supreme outrage" of sending these "tens of thousands of savage men" to the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=5}} Morel predicated the "black horror"  would cause another world war, writing that the average German boy was thinking: "''Boys these men raped your mothers and sisters''" (emphasis in the original) .{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=5}} General [[Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson|C.B. Thomson]] of the British Army published an article in ''The Daily Herald'', which stated that based on his extensive service in Africa, that he knew about the "sexual proclivities" of Africans "who in default of their own race must have intercourse with European women".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=6-7}} General Thomson denounced France for training "these savages" who are "being taught to despise the European races".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=7}} On 14 April 1920, a Labour MP, [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood]], stated in the House of Commons that his party "did not consider Senegalese proper troops to garrison German towns" and asked the government to apply pressure on France to pull out the Senegalese.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=9}} In the spring and summer of 1920, Labour MPs repeatedly raised the issue of the "black horror" in the Rhineland and demanded the government do something to force the French to pull out their African soldiers.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=9-10}} In September 1920 at a meeting of the [[Trade Union Congress]], free copies of Morel's pamphlet ''The Horror on the Rhine'' were handed to the delegates so that they learn about the "injustices" of Versailles and the "horrors" faced by the working class of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=6}}

On 30 April 1920, the left-wing Vancouver newspaper, the ''British Columbia Federationist'' ran a front-paper cover story "The Black Scourge Is Now Ravaging Europe".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=483}} The article began that the following story "was a revelation so horrible that only the strongest sense that it is our duty to let the public know what is being done would induce use to publish it".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=483}} On 10 May 1920, the Prime Minister of Sweden, [[Hjalmar Branting]], declared in a speech his belief in the truth of Morel's claims, saying that as a white man he was outraged that the French would deploy Senegalese troops in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=488}} In August 1920, Morel first used the phrase "the black horror on the Rhine" in one of his pamphlets to describe the alleged atrocities.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} In the United States, so many letters had been received by outraged citizens that President Wilson in June 1920 asked Secretary of State [[Bainbridge Colby]], to have the American ambassador in Paris, [[Hugh Campbell Wallace]], to investigate these stories.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} General Henry T. Allen, the commander of the American occupation force in Coblenz together with the diplomat E.L. Dresel carried out an investigation and reported on 25 June 1920 that almost all of the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were baseless.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}}  Dresel wrote nearly all of the stories about atrocities were untrue and General Allen praised the "good discipline" of the Senegalese.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} Both men concluded that the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were being made to influence U.S. public opinion.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} After the [[Red Summer]] of 1919, which had seen widespread race riots across the United States causing hundreds of deaths, most of them African-American, white American public opinion was very sensitive to stories about "uppity" blacks getting out of hand, and was inclined to sympathize with those who claimed to be threatened by blacks.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} The U.S. government did not chose to make these reports public at the time.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}}

A reporter for ''The Nation'', Lewis Gannett, who went to the Rhineland to investigate the allegations found them to be mostly false.{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} Gannett found that there had been cases of rape of German women and girls by the Senegalese, but the total number was far smaller than what had been alleged by Morel; that white French troops had also raped German women, a matter that did not interest Morel very much; and that in rape cases "the French have inflicted severe punishment upon all soldiers guilty of transgressing against the civil population".{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} A study done by the British journalist J. Ellis Baker in  published in July 1921 edition of ''Current History'' found that between 1918-1921 that there had been a total of 72 creditable allegations of criminal conduct made against "colored troops" in the Rhineland, and of which only 9 concerned allegations of rape.{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} Baker's study also listed 96 allegations of criminal conduct which had been judged "doubtful"  and 59 which were found to be "unjustified".{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} The German journalist [[Maximilian Harden]] wrote that the sex between "colored" soldiers in the French Army and German women in the Rhineland was mostly consensual, writing: "German women were chiefly responsible for the mingling of colored and white blood which has taken place by the Rhine".{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}}

The German historian Christian Koller in an exhaustive study of complaints made by the Rhinelanders against "colored" French occupation forces found that most of the complaints were of a petty nature, such as playing unauthorized football games in parks.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} Most of the complaints about violence by "colored" soldiers in [[Worms]] involved Moroccans, usually brawls in the streets, and Koller found that complaints about sexual violence from the Senegelese were "rare" with the mayor of Worms actually wanting the "well disciplined" Senegalese to stay rather than be replaced by the more combative Moroccans.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} In Wiesbaden, relations between the Rhinelanders and the French occupation forces were more tense with references to brawls, property damage and "four cases of death caused by the colored troops", which was less than those that white French troops were accused of.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} Koller also noted the vague nature of the "black horror" claims and that when it came to specifics, many of the claims of rape by the Senegalese have a "sameness" to not only the accounts of the alleged rapes, but even the same words and phrasing, which led Koller to conclude that the accounts were almost certainly fabricated.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} On the whole, Koller found that there were isolated cases of rape by "colored" soldiers, but there was nothing to support the claim of a reign of terror in the Rhineland by "colored" forces.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} The historian Raffael Scheck wrote most German newspapers outside of the Rhineland ran the "Black Horror" stories, but in fact it seems that relations between the "colored" troops and the Rhinelanders were "mostly friendly, sometimes ''too'' friendly for the critics" as some Rhenish women gave birth to illegitimate children with African, Berber, Arab and Asian features known by the disparaging term, the Rhineland Bastards.{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=96}}

In the summer of 1920, Morel visited the Rhineland to investigate the matter himself, and in August 1920, he published his pamphlet ''The Horror on the Rhine''.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=479}} Within a month, all 5, 000 copies of ''The Horror on the Rhine'' had sold out and by April 1921 there had been 8 editions of ''The Horror on the Rhine''.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=479}} The third edition of ''The Horror on the Rhine'' featured endorsed by the former German chancellor Prince Max of Baden; [[Jean Longuet]] of the French Socialist Party; four Socialist members of the Italian parliament; and General C. B. Thomson.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=479}} In ''The Horror on the Rhine'', Morel wrote about black men having an uncontrolled, fierce sexuality that made them want to rape white women.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=480}} Morel wrote: "In ones or twos, sometimes in parties, big, stewart men from the warmer climes, armed with sword-bayonets or knives, sometimes with revolvers, living unnatural lives of restraint, their fierce passions hot within them, roam the countryside".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=480}} The African-American philosopher [[Alain LeRoy Locke]] visited the Rhineland to investigate Morel's claims and found them mostly baseless.{{sfn|Galen Last|2015|p=183}} Locke also interviewed the soldiers of the French Army, which he praised as a multi-racial force when skin color did not matter, and stated the morale of the Senegalese was holding up well.{{sfn|Galen Last|2015|p=183}}

==International reception==
The claims made by the German government did influence American public opinion. [[Dudley Field Malone]], the leader of the [[Farmer–Labor Party]], wrote to President Wilson that: "thoughtful persons in America and throughout the world are horrified by the victimization of German women and girls by half-savage African troops".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} The French writer [[Romain Rolland]] issued a statement approving of Morel's articles and declared: "The incredible blindness of statesmen who without realizing it are turning Europe over to the black and yellow continents, which they are armed with their own hands, is itself the unconscious instrument of Destiny".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=485}} [[Lothrop Stoddard]], a professor at Harvard, an avowed white supremacist and eugenist, had just published his best-selling book ''The Rising Tide of Color Against World-wide White Supremacy'', warning of a black-Asian threat to the "white races".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=482}} Upon reading Morel's  ''The Horror on the Rhine'', Stoddard promptly issued his approval, warning of the "extreme fecundity" of blacks and that "black blood, once entering a human stock, seems never to really bred out again".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=482}} In October 1920, a debate took place at a conference of Protestant clergymen at the World Ecumenical Conference in Geneva, when a Lutheran pastor from Germany asked the conference to condemn the "black horror".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=21}} The African-American Reverend John R. Hawkins, representing the African Methodist Episcopal church from Washington D.C. said in response: ""It was most unfortunate...he should take occasion to drag into this place for high and lofty sentiments the slime and venom of the monster, colour prejudice...Crimes committed by soldiers drunk with the feeling of resentment and the passions of bloody battles have followed all wars; there is no reason for making this invidious distinction and holding up the coloured troops alone to be guilty of such atrocities...The dusky sons of Ham, whether from Africa or America, have come to Europe are among the bravest of the brave and the noblest of the noble, and I will not be silent while their record is attacked."{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=21}}

The ''Christian Science Monitor'' in an editorial on 28 October 1920 wrote: "France has gone even further than an eye-for-eye and has outplayed Germany at its worse, in a way so terrible that it is impossible to indulge in details".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} Two weeks later, the ''Christian Science Monitor'' (CSM) retracted the editorial after receiving a letter from the French consul in Koblenz who showed that the total number of Senegalese in the Rhineland were 5 000, not the 50, 000 alleged by the ''Christian Science Monitor''; that there had been a total of 13 reported cases of rape of German women by the Senegalese, not the thousands alleged by the CSM; and that in all 13 cases, the rapists had been sentenced to death after being convicted with the consul noting sharply that the French Army did not tolerate rapists in its ranks.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' seeing that the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were effective in gaining international sympathy for the ''Reich'' greatly increased its propaganda with pamphlets detailing the alleged war crimes committed by the Senegalese being published in English, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' attached so importance to the promoting the "Black Horror on the Rhine" stories that the German embassies in Lima and Santiago were ordered to make publicizing ''Die schwarze Schand'' their main priority.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} Nelson described the pamphlets handed out by the German diplomats-some of which were written by "cranks" and which verged on the pornographic in their depiction of fair German girls being raped by brutish Africans-as presenting a long list of rapes said to be committed by the Senegalese against German women and girls on the orders of their French officers.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} In 1921, a film was produced in Munich about the "black horror on the Rhine" that played all over Germany and in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} In June 1921, Beveridge gave a speech at the Sagebiel Hall in Hamburg attended by some 50, 000 people during she accused the Senegalese of raping thousands of German women and girls since they had arrived in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}}

Much of the fury that the "colored" troops generated in Germany was due to the way that they inverted the normal racial hierarchy with black, brown and Asian men holding power over white Germans.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} A recurring theme of German complaints against the Senegalese was that Germany had now been "colonized" by Africans.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} A German writer, Alfred von Wrochem, in his best-selling book ''The Colonization of the Rhineland by France'' had attacked the French for undermining belief in worldwide white supremacy by using Senegalese troops.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} During World War I, the presence of Africans fighting in the French Army had in the word of the British historian Barbara Bush had made "trans-racial sex between white women and black men of all classes an obsession with white men".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} The stationing of Senegalese troops in the Rhineland had tapped into these fears.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} The British ambassador to Germany, [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon|Lord D'Abederon]] wrote: "The war increased the German's respect for, and his dislike of the English, but has done nothing to diminish his belief in his own superior sturdiness compared with the French. This will continue subconsciously and subcutaneously whatever happens-even though France possesses an overpowering army and the Germans have no organised means of resistance".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}} A theme of much the "black horror" propaganda was that of a massive contempt for the French who had to use "colored" troops to fight their wars.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}} One of the leading "black horror" propagandists, August Ritter von Eberlein, wrote: "Without her colored troops, France is not in a position in the present tense situation to maintain her militarism and imperialism".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}}

The fear of sexuality of black men was especially felt very strongly by white feminists and throughout the 1920s, feminist publications in the United States and the United Kingdom presented the "black horror on the Rhine" stories as true.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=473}} An interesting exception was when ''The British Columbia Federationist'' ran an article in October 1920 titled "France Creates Hell West of the Rhine", accusing the Senegalese soldiers of committing "numberless outrages against women and girls".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=485}} The Canadian historian Peter Campbell noted that the "fascinating aspect" was that there were no letters to the editor of the ''British Columbia Federationist'' expressing either approval or disapproval; which he noted was odd given the way in which the article appealed to the prejudices in the most base way, suggesting that the largely white, working-class readers of ''British Columbia Federationist'' did not approve of the anti-black message.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=485-486}} In France, a French Socialist [[Charles Gide]] wrote on 16 March 1921 edition of the newspaper ''Foi et Vie'' that Morel claimed that he wanted to protect the Africans, but: "''le genre de protection de M. Morel rappelle un peu le precepte que fait afficher la Society protectrice des animaux: 'Soyez bons pour les betes'''" (Mr. Morel's kind of protection is a little reminiscent of the precepts of the Society for the Protection of Animals: 'Be good to the animals').{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=19}}

One group founded in Munich in September 1921 to campaign against the "black horror" was the ''Notbund'' led by Heinrich Distler.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=137}} Known for its enthusiastic hyperbole and its usually false claims, the ''Notbund'''s pamphlets claimed the Senegalese were raping 100 women/per day in the Rhineland and the Malagasy had caused epidemics of tuberculosis, dysentery, syphilis, malaria, Malta fever, leprosy, Phagedänismus and parasitic worms in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=140}} Appealing to the medical ignorance of its readers, the ''Notbund'' maintained that it was possible to contract leprosy solely by being in the presence of a black man without even touching him.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=140}} In Britain, Norman Angell in his 1921 book ''The Fruits of Victory'' wrote the worse aspect of the Treaty of Versailles was the stationing of the Senegalese in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=11-12}} Angell accused the French of putting "cannibals from the African forests" into the "cultured" university towns of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=12}}

==Racial fears==
The motivations of the "black horror" writers differed greatly. The German sociologist Iris Wigger divided the writers into two types; a "liberal racism" that embraced writers such as E.D Morel and the former Italian Prime Minister [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] who used the "black horror" stories primarily as a weapon for attacking the Treaty of Versailles, and a "conservative racism" that embraced figures such as the German writer Guido Kreutzer and the American actress Ray Beveridge mainly found within in Germany that used the "black horror" stories primarily as a weapon for attacking the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=113-114}}

===Racism on the left===
In Morel's own mind, he was an anti-racist who was fighting for the Africans.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=52}} Morel believed that Africans were far closer to nature than Europeans and as such, the Africans had “the uneducated soul of the savage” and were not up to the demands of modern industrial society.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=52}} As such, Morel believed that blacks being creatures of "strong emotions" needed to be protected from "modern civilization" which they were allegedly not capable of handling, which explained his campaigning against the [[Congo Free State]] which tried to bring modern work discipline to the Congo in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=51-52}} At the same time, Morel believed that Africans, lacking the self-discipline of whites, had an uncontrolled sexuality.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=52-53}} In a 1911 essay after visiting Nigeria, Morel had written the "reproduction" of the black race was the main "obsession" of all black people, writing about the "instinctive and mysterious" call of racial need which supposedly made all black people obsessed with sex all the time to the exclusion of everything else, declaring that "sexual obsession" was the "elementary racial desire" of black people.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=53}} In this viewpoint, as long as Africans were left in their "natural savage state", all would be well as Africans were not capable of meeting the sexual self-discipline of Europeans, which is why Morel condemned the efforts of missionaries in Africa.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=53}} Through Morel had been very forceful in condemning the cruel exploitation of the Congo Free State, Morel believed in imperialism, just not the cruel exploitative imperialism of the Congo Company, writing it was the duty of whites to serve as the "trustees" for blacks and the "great white father" who would protect the "basic human rights" of Africans while at the same time accepting the "infantile" nature of black people who not the equal in any way of whites.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=54}} [[File: 1922_Edmund_Dene_Morel.jpg|thumb|right|Morel in 1922]]
Morel was very anti-French not only because of his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, but because of the nature of France's ''mission civilisatrice'' ("civilizing mission") in Africa whereby any African who was willing to embrace the French language and culture would become French and theoretically the equal of whites threatened to upend Morel's beliefs in the essential biological inferiority of blacks.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=55-56}} Morel believed that the Africans were committing outrageous crimes against Germans in the Rhineland because the French had empowered them by least theoretically making them into black Frenchmen who were just as much citizens of the republic as anyone else.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=55-56}} Precisely because Morel believed in the uncontrolled sexuality of blacks, it was self-evident to him that the "sexually uncontrolled and uncontrollable" Senegalese would run amok in the Rhineland, raping every German female in sight.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=57}} As part of his call for international solidarity with a Germany alleged to be victimized by the Treaty of Versailles, Morel wrote: ‘For the working classes the importation of Negro mercenaries by the hundred thousand from the heart of Africa, to fight the battles and execute the lusts of capitalist governments in the heart of Europe is...a terrifc portent. The workers, alike in Britain, France, and Italy will be ill-advised if they allow it to pass in silence because today the victims happen to be German.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=59}} Morel used the alleged massive sexual violence committed against women in the Rhineland as a call for racial togetherness, writing it was in the interests of all white peoples to assist Germany with revising the terms of Versailles which permitted the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=60}} In the same way, Morel used the "black horror" as a way of attacking France which had caused a  “sexual horror on the Rhine” and whose “reign of terror” was a “giant evil” that should inspire “shame into all four corners of the world” and ultimately should “a revision of the Versailles Treaty and the relief for Germany.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=60}}

Nitti, a liberal Italian politician was known for his calls for an "United States of Europe", believing that only when all of the nations of Europe become one would all of the problems of modern Europe be solved.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=61-63}} In this regard, Nitti was strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles, which he called the "instrument of oppression" against Germany, the "most cultured nation" in the world.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=64}} As part of his critique of Versailles, Nitti wrote that the French had put the most "backward nations" in the Rhineland, declaring some of the "most cultured cities in Europe" that been subjected to "Negro violence" and to "physical and moral trials unknown for centuries in civilized countries".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=65}} Nitti wrote the occupation of the Rhineland "had no military aim" but rather was an "attempt to force Germany to the point of moral exhaustion".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=65}} At the same time, Nitti, who was very well worried about the prospect of a Communist revolution in Germany, used the "black horror" stories as a way of creating unity in Germany, urging that all Germans regardless of class should unite in the common struggle against France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=64-65}} As part of his call for European unity, Nitti went out of his way to portray France's African soldiers as an alien body that did not belong in Europe at all, which allowed him to condemn France as the nation responsible for this state of affairs.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=66}} Nitti wrote the Senegalese were guilty of "any form of violence and crime" as their "yesterday the representatives of cannibalistic races" whom were now occupying the "country of the greatest thinkers in Europe".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=66}} Throughout his speeches and essays, Nitti drew a contrast between Europeans who constituted civilization vs Africans who represented barbarism.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=69}} Nitti even so far as to say he was shocked to see and hear "music gangs of Negroes and Berbers of Africa" play "African music programmes" on the "squares of the occupied cities".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=69}} Nitti wrote for him it "seemed unbearable" that Germans whose nation was a "cradle of musical genius" to listen to "Negro music".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=69}} As part of his call to revise Versailles, Nitti urged that the other European nations together with the United States were under the obligation to "save culture...from the flood of barbarism" as "Germany's fall" would mean "the downfall of one the largest driving forces of humanity".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=66-67}} As part of his demand for a pan-Western effort to save Germany, Nitti wrote he could hear the “cry of pain of the German woman", which he wrote was a “most terrible accusation against Christian peoples,” who called themselves “civilized and democratic.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=70}}

Wigger stated that writers on both sides were equally racist, but there was a difference between those as Morel and Nitti whose main interest was in revising the terms of Versailles in Germany's favor, and those like Kreutzer and Beveridge whose main interest was in proving the Weimar Republic was too "weak" to stand up to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=113-114}} The same conclusion was reached by the British historian Peter Collar who wrote: "...there existed in Germany a fundamental disagreement over the value of propaganda and the use to which it might be put. To the idealists of the new Republic it offered a way for Germany to advance her cause abroad in the widest sense and to get away from the excesses of the Wilhelmine era...The Right saw things quite differently. In the far Right, exemplified in party political terms by the DNVP and by some within the Bavarian BVP, there existed a deep desire to return to past authoritarian certainty, a past that was idealised in the imaginaton. The concepts behind the new Republic were totally alien and were to be opposed at every opportunity."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=258-259}} The campaign against the "black horror" was not one campaign coordinated by the ''Reich'' government, but several different campaigns launched by the ''Reich'', Bavarian, and Prussian governments together with a number of private groups.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250-251}} With the notable exceptions of the Communists and [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democrats]], every political group in Germany endorsed the "black horror" campaign thought Collar described the [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]] more as "fellow travelers in the propaganda war rather than a driving force".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=251}} Racism was so pervasive in Europe at the time that the "black or colored man was generally considered by the white European to be his inferior".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}}

===Racism on the right===
Ray Beveridge, a conservative Germanophile American actress and an ardent racist who was of the leading speakers on the subject, used the "black horror" as a call for a right-wing ''Volksgemeinschaft'' ("people's community"), urging the German people to reject the Weimar republic and rally around the ''völkisch'' right, which she claimed were the only men capable of "standing up" to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=72 &amp; 114}} Beveridge was well known for her exaggerated claims and a speaking style that sought to appeal to the worse prejudices in her audience, often spoke about the "mindless blacks" with "enormous sex drives and unrestrained passion" who allegedly would attack "white women, white girls, white youth, often old people and even children".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=77}} Beveridge usually began her speeches with the remark:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why do I come here, an American, to speak to you about the ''Schwarze Schmach''? Because I come from a nation that ever since it came into being has been threatened by black and yellow problems and the black and yellow peril!...I appeal to women in the world! I appeal to all men worthy of the name. Help! White women, white boys are in danger everyday, every hour of the day as long as a black is allowed to have power over a white women!"{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=126}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; An avowed white supremacist, Beveridge sought to impute the worse about black men, saying in one speech:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Victims of the promiscuous passions of the blacks are found half dead in meadows and ditches, their clothes in tatters, their delicate young bodies torn by the brutality of the attacks. Many have bite wounds which show clearly how wildly the black beast has fallen on his victim. I could quote innumerable examples with names and dates; and it must not be forgotten that almost all these men are infected with venereal diseases"."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=126-127}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beveridge's speeches were well attended and are described in contemporary newspaper reports as being greeted with huge applause, but others involved in the "black horror" campaign like Margarete Gärtner, the chairwoman of the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'', regarded Beveridge as a liability as she was prone to making exaggerated and false claims in her speeches that were easily rebutted by the French.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=127-129}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' in a report stated that Beveridge was harming the German side as she "outdoes the ''Notbund'' in her hysterical extremes".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=176-177}} Collar called Beveridge the most extreme of all the speakers on the theme of the "black horror", describing her as the preferred spokeswoman of the "extreme right" in Germany with her speeches being "nothing less than an incitement to racial hatred".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=129}} In one of her speeches, Beveridge said: "Your weapons have been taken from you, but there still remains a rope and a tree. Take up the natural arms which our men from the South resort: lynch! Hang every black who assaults a white person!"{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=16}} However, Collar wrote that Beveridge who was fluent in German was a "charismatic orator...able to whip up her audience into a frenzy".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=216}} Linking all this together was Bevridge's call for the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', saying that the "German spirit, the German science, the German culture, and the German work" were more than enough to defeat France, provided that all Germans stand "faithfully together" and put the nation ahead of "party politics".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=76}} In a speech in a Munich beerhall, Beveridge declared: "Germans unite-unity is power-only with power can you shake the chains of Versailles!".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=76}}

As part of her appeal, Beveridge spoke the need to keep the ''Volkskörper'' (the collective "racial body" of the German people) pure, and as such German women as the bearers of the next generation of Germans had the most important part of the ''Volkskörper''.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} In Beveridge's mind, the alleged sexual crimes against German women were bad enough, but even worse by threatening the ''Volkskörper'' threatened the very existence of the German "race".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} For Beveridge, the purity of the ''Volkskörper'' was so important that any man who did not fight against the "black horror" was not only a  “slacker” and “traitor of his country”, but also a  “traitor against the white race.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} Beveridge often spoke of her "shame" for the “German race” who was not willing “to protect” the “honour”  of his women from the ''Fremdkörper'' (alien body) that was now threatening the ''Volkskörper'' in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} At the time of the Munich Beerhall ''putsch'', Beveridge came out in support for the National Socialists, declaring it “an enormous honor” to mobilise, together with her German husband, “the ''Chiemgau'' for Adolf Hitler”.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=72}} At the time, Beveridge had said in a speech that Hitler together with General Erich Ludendorff were her “German heroes”.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=72}} Beveridge later on in the 1930s renounced her U.S. citizenship to become a German citizen, joined the NSDAP, and was a well known "admirer of Hitler"."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=128}}

Likewise, the ''völkisch''  German writer Guido Kreutzer used the "black horror on the Rhine" as a way of attacking both what he saw as the "unjust" Treaty of Versailles and even more so the Weimar Republic, which was too "weak" to stand up to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=83-84}}  In his very popular 1921 novel ''Die Schwarze Schmach: Der Roman des geschändeten Deutschlands'' (''The Black Shame A Novel of Disgraced Germany''), Kreutzer portrayed the Senegalese and Moroccan soldiers as thuggish rapists who violate thousands upon thousands of innocent German girls in the Rhineland, who have all the stereotypical "Aryan" look with fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes; the hero of the novel repeatedly calls the Senegalese "nigger scum".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84-85}} The preface to  ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' was written by the  ''völkisch'' activist  [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow|Count Ernst zu Reventlow]] whom praised the novel as a much needed call for the ''Volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} Reventlow wrote that Jesus Christ had taught all Christians to love their neighbor, which he took to mean all Germans should love the Rhinelanders and hate the French, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is this national hatred that we need! It must pulsate evenly throughout the German people, uniting them and driving them forward. This hatred of an entire people, despite a lack of weapons, will build an insuperable force and, from a certain moment in time, an irresistible one. It must act everywhere and at every moment against the French interloper. In the long term, no conqueror has ever been able to withstand such hatred and at this time in Germany the conqueror is not even there by virtue of his own power."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=167-168}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; In this regard, Reventlow complained that the German people were far too disunited at present, and needed to become united by hating the French, which was why he recommended reading the novel.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=168}}

Kreutzer used ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' as a way of attacking the Weimar Republic which is portrayed as a weak and ineffective in face of the "black horror on the Rhine", and called for Germans to embrace a "strongman" leader who would rule as a dictator.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84-85}}  The cover of ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' featured an ape-like black man wearing the uniform of a French Army private holding a half-naked white woman with a lascivious expression on his face.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=116}} The hero of the novel is Baron von Yrsch, an aristocrat, former Prussian Army general, war hero and a friend of the former Emperor Wilhelm II who lives on his estate outside of an unnamed town in the Rhineland together with his beautiful daughter, whom the Senegalese naturally want to rape.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} Yrsch complains about the weak Emperor who abdicated and left into exile while leaving his 70 million loyal subjects "in the abyss".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=166}} Reflecting his nationalistic views, Kreutzer has a French officer say: "The German Army was the moral victor. Only numerical superiority and hunger had finally forced it to its knees. France by itself would have been overrun by Germany in less than four weeks without being able to offer any serious resistance".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=166}} To humiliate Yrsch, the French demand they be allowed to open a brothel on the grounds of his estate to be operated by his daughter Marlene.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=166-167}} The Moroccans serving in the French Army are described as having "a rough-hewn black-brown face; bulging yellowish eyes buried deep under the forehead beneath the steel helmet; the predator teeth dazzlingly bright between the burning red lips".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=167}}

Another supporting character is Lampré, the son of a Rhineland industrialist and a Rhenish separatist whom initially collaborates with the French, but sees the error of his ways when confronted with the "black horror" and in the climax of the novel saves Yrsch's daughter from being raped by a "mulatto" French Army officer by killing him.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} When the collaborating mayor orders Yrsch out of the town, thousands of the ''Burschenschaften'' (student fraternities) join forces with the town's workers in a demonstration to persuade him to stay.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} The villain of the novel is the "mulatto" Captain Mustapha Hassan of the French Army; the fact that "half-Arabian" Hassan is a Muslim, the self-proclaimed "black raven of Allah", who is a descendant of Muslim warriors who fought against the Crusades was meant by Kreutzer to show that France is not longer a "civilized" European Christian nation, but has rather become a "mulatto" nation that has rejected the values of the European family of nations.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} In an important symbolic moment, when Captain Hassan tries to rape Yrsch's daughter and Lampré comes to her defense, Hassan's white chauffeur fires a shot at him with his revolver that instead shoots off a finger of a statue of Christ in front of a church, thereby showing the French have turned their backs on Christian Europe.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} In another important scene, Lampré confronts his Rhenish separatist father to tell him that he "wants to be German again" rather than associate with the "niggers" of France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}}  Lampré's industrialist father is portrayed as blinded by greed and he has to decided to support Rhenish separatism out of the potential to make millions from working with the French.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} Ultimately, Lampré's father sees the error of his ways and he too rediscovers his pride in being German again.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} The Lamprés ''pere'' and ''fils'' represent the elegantly cosmopolitan and Francophile Catholic middle classes of the Rhineland who often resented Prussian militarism as crude and overbearing, seeing themselves as a more civilized type of German.

Kreutzer also used ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' as a way of reinforcing traditional gender roles as German women are portrayed as a weak and passive, unable to protect themselves from the rampaging Senegalese and Moroccans, needing the "manly" German men to protect them.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Using  ''völkisch'' language, Kreutzer called for all Germans to feel for their "tormented ''volksgenossen''" (national comrades) in the Rhineland, rediscover their "national source of strength" by uniting against the common foe, and allow "the ''völkisch'' spark to spread".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} In the novel, the bodies of German women represent both literally and symbolically the tormented German nation attacked by African "savages" with the female body serving as a symbol of German racial purity.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Significantly, the children born to German mothers and Senegalese fathers are all born "physically and morally degenerate" and are not considered to be German.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Furthermore, all of the women raped are by the Senegalese cease to be German the moment they are raped, and it is made clear that there is no place in the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' for them.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Kreutzer accuses France of seeking to "undermine the nation's health" by allowing African soldiers to "rape and defile" German women, who are portrayed as virtuous, wholesome and chaste symbols of German racial purity, blessed with the sacred task of bearing the next generation of Germans.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=95}}

Lampré rejects his French lover, a licentious dancer and a "worldly little animal" whose "soulless chirping voices" and overt sexuality he finds repulsive for the more wholesome and German figure of Marlene von Yrsch.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=95}} Marlene von Yrsch is blessed with all the beauty of her "race", having a "girly pristine charm", blonde hair worn in a "Greek node", "wise eyes", an "elegantly narrow face" with beautiful "curved brows" and a "slim shape" to her body.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96}}  Marlene von Yrsch is a symbol of not only Germany, but also of the white race in general, marking out the all that was beautiful in the world vs. the hideously deformed bodies of the Senegalese, Moroccan and Vietnamese soldiers serving in the French Army.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96}} The mere sight of her causes Lampré to desert from the French Foreign Legion as he sees in her a "woe reminder of the fatherland lost forever" as his mind is flooded with images of his lost ''Heimat'', filling him with "shame" for having fought for France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96}} By contrast, Captain Mustapha Hassan is portrayed as a sexual predator with "primitively carved features" and a "brutal" sexuality, an ugly man with beady lips who "bites like an animal" at the sight of Marlene.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96-97}} When Marlene rejects his advances, calling him a "half-civilized savage" with "all the arrogance of her race", he becomes obsessed with raping her in revenge.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=97}} Lampré vows to protect Marlene, saying she will not be "fair game for this nigger", saying his "conscience as a human being and a man" will not let do otherwise and thereby redeems himself for his "treason" for having fought for France in the Foreign Legion.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=97-98}}

Finally, Kreutzer used ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' as a way of attacking the Social Democrats as group of working class characters in the Rhineland in the novel ultimately abandoned the SPD as they find it is only right-wing leaders like Yrsch who can create the  ''Volksgemeinschaft'' that will allow Germany to stand up to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=113}} Reflecting Kreutzer's conservative politics, in ''Die Schwarze Schmach'', the working class characters finally learn the SPD is a divisive force that weakens the German people by dividing the working class from the rest of the German people, and it is when the Rhenish working class learn to accept leadership from traditional elites such as the aristocracy and the industrialists that the German people can finally be united as one in the form of the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' to stand up to France, Germany's ancient archenemy which was responsible for the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84-90}} In the novel, the working class march under the "old black-white-red flags" to protest the "black horror" and the expulsion order against the "national hero" Yrsch; in Germany the colors red, white and black symbolize the right while the colors red, black and gold symbolize the left.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=90}} In one scene, a delegation of workers led by a huge union official respectfully pay a visit to Yrsch's estate to ask him to lead them on a struggle against the French, which was Kreutzer's way of showing that Germans needed to defer to their traditional elites to become great again.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=90}} In paternal relationship, aristocrats like Yrsch understand the problems of the working class, and argue for fair treatment of the workers by their employers, which was Kreutzer's way of saying that in the  ''Volksgemeinschaft'' the German people would all be united together as a one big happy family.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=90-91}} The novel repeatedly hammers home the point that only if the German people are united as one in the form of the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' can Germany recover from the defeat of 1918, and throughout the novel Germans are of all classes are seen as victimized by the French and their "colored" troops.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=89}} Wigger suggested that Kreutzer was using his racism as a way of uniting all Germans together as the working class characters find the question of racial purity more important than their wages, working conditions and standards of living, and at one point a union official says that every working-class family must be opposed to "mad strikes and Communist agitations" that weaken the unity of the German nation.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=92}} In this regard, when the union leaders rebuke Lampré's father for his treasonous activities, he ceases to be an "exploitative" capitalist and turns into a "good German capitalist", having a very paternal relationship with his workers whom he takes care of and in their return defer to him.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=93}}

At the end of the novel, Lampré marries Marlene and becomes a killing machine, saying no-one will ever threaten his "German sanctuary again", and his "soul is finally at peace" as he takes up the task of killing Senegalese and Moroccans with gusto.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=98}} He and his bride enjoy a brief moment of happiness as they "raved and kissed" by the banks of the river Rhine and sing the song ''Lovers by the Rhine''; subsequently an attempt to escape the Rhineland ends with Marlene being killed while Lampré who once rejected German nationalism sees it is too late for him and that his "treason" for having served France can never be fully redeemed.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=98}} Collar wrote that in Kreutzer's novel, the "Black Horror" was "...almost subsidiary in his eyes to a bigger issue-the simple fact that Germany had lost the war. The book was simply the expression of his resentment and fury...The tenor of the book leaves little doubt that it reflected the views of the extreme right-wing ''völkisch'' circles, for whom defeat had come as a crushing blow and for whom the new Republic was an abomination. For them the ''Schwarze Schmach'' was clearly but one element in the array of grievances against France. Incitement of public hatred leading to a war of revenge in the indefinite future was much in evidence".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=167-168}}

==French response==
In response to stories about the "black horror on the Rhine", the French government published pamphlets settling to rebut the "calumnies" while several French newspapers in editorials accused the Germans of engaging in racism.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} In 1921 the French government published a pamphlet ''La campagne contre les troupes noires'', defending the Senegalese and pointing out inaccuracies in the articles by Morel and Beveridge's speeches, for instance, stating that 50, 000 Senegalese had not been stationed in the Rhineland with the total number of "colored" troops in the Rhineland numbering 25, 000, of which 4, 00 were Senegalese.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=221}} The pamphlet also quoted from German newspapers such as ''Sozialistische Republik'', ''Der Christliche Pilger'' and ''Deutsche pazifistische Monatsschrift'', which all ran stories testifying to the good behavior of the "colored" troops.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=222}} In Paris, the ''Comité d'Assistance aux Troupes Noires'' was founded to defend the reputation of the Senegalese.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} French Army doctors published statistics showing that there was not an abnormally high rate of sybills among the Senegalese and the German claim that the Africans had brought sleeping sickness to the Rhineland could not be true as none of the Senegalese stationed in the Rhineland had sleeping sickness.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619-620}} Love letters between German women and their Senegalese boyfriends were published in French newspapers in attempt to show that the Senegalese were not the mindless brutes intent upon raping white women as claimed by the German government.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619-620}} The American historian Julia Roos wrote the debate about the "Black Horror" stories cut across ideological lines with for instance in France it was chiefly left-wing groups that felt the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany who were the most receptive towards promoting "black horror" stories while it was conservatives believed in the justice of Versailles who defended the Senegalese against the "black horror" claims.&lt;ref name=Roos-2015&gt;{{cite web

==Reception in the United States==
However, the French efforts were in vain. On the night of 28 February 1921, a protest rally attended by 12, 000 was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City where France was condemned for the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=620}} A Republican Representative, [[Frederick A. Britten]], issued resolution condemning France for the "black horror on the Rhine", and which called the Senegalese "semi-civilized, useless and oft-times brutal defamers of women".{{sf|Campbell|2014|p=488-489}} The American feminist Harriet Connor Brown in a letter to the State Department written in early 1921 accused Senegalese soldiers of rape, attempted rape, "immoral crimes against boys" and of forcing German officials in the Rhineland to open brothels for their benefit.{{sf|Campbell|2014|p=490}} The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom issued a statement condemning the "black horror on the Rhine" that was signed by all 25 of its white members of its central committee, and the only one who refused to sign was the lone African-American on the central committee, [[Mary Church Terrell|Mary Terrell]], who refused to sign a statement that was a "direct appeal to race prejudice".{{sf|Campbell|2014|p=490}}

The Francophile Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge had received leaked copies of the reports by Allen and Dresel, which he read out on the Senate floor "as act of justice and comity to a friendly nation [France]".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=620}} Liberal American journals like ''The Nation'' and ''The New Republic'' ran several articles debunking the claims of "the black horror on the Rhine", showing that there were relatively few cases of rape by the Senegalese soldiers.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=621-622}} ''The New York Times''  in an article on 25 June 1921 wrote about "a horrid lack of horrors on the Rhine".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}} By 1921, many mayors in the Rhineland were complaining in letters to the ''Reich'' government in Berlin that the "black horror" propaganda had been too successful, charging that the picture of the Rhineland overrun by Senegalese soldiers looting, raping and killing with impunity, had destroyed the tourist trade.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}} For this reason, the Rhenish mayors asked the ''Reich'' government stop the "black horror" propaganda which had ruined the tourism trade in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}}

==Story revives==
When [[Raymond Poincaré]], a French conservative well known for his views about upholding the Treaty of Versailles, became the French premier in 1922, there was a much revival of the "black horror on the Rhineland" stories both in Germany and abroad.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}} In Washington, Democratic Senator [[Gilbert Hitchcock]] in a speech on the Senate floor asked the administration of President Warren G. Harding "suggest to France the substitution of white troops for black on the Rhine".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}} When the former French premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] visited the United States in November 1922, Senator Hitchcock confronted Clemenceau over the alleged "black outrages" in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}} In a speech, Senator Hitchcock declared about the Senegalese: "They are men of an inferior, half-civilized race. They are brutes when stationed among white people, as the evidence shows".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}}  Otto Wiefeldt, the German ambassador in Washington asked that his superiors supply him with "current information preferably with sensational details" as he noted that the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were winning over American public opinion to a pro-German position.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}}

However, the French occupation of the Ruhr on 11 January 1923 caused the ''Auswärtige Amt'' to lose interest in the "black horror on the Rhine" story.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} Poincaré deliberately used only white troops in occupying the Ruhr to avoid more "black horror" stories, through the claim that a Senegalese regiment had been stationed in [[Essen]] was widely believed in both Germany and abroad.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} For most Germans, the French occupation of the Ruhr was a sufficiently "heinous crime against the peace" that there was no need to embellish it with "black horror" stories.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} At the same time, the last American occupation troops had been withdrawn from the Rhineland in January 1923, which meant that American public opinion was less important in courting.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} In a speech given in Darmstadt on 13 February 1923, the Social Democratic German president [[Friedrich Ebert]] said: "''daß die Verwendung farbiger Truppen niederster Kultur als Aufseher über eine Bevölkerung von der hohen geistigen und wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung der Rheinländer eine herausfordernde Verletzung der Gesetze europäischer Zivilisation ist''" ("the use of troops of the lowest culture over the population of the highest spiritual and economic importance in the Rhineland is a challenging violation of the laws of European civilization").{{sfn|Koller|2001|p=38}}

==Continuing obsession==
After 1921, the ''Reich'' government started to downplay the "Black Horror" propaganda, which had ruined tourism in the Rhineland, causing much resentment in a largely Catholic region that at very least wanted to break away from Protestant majority Prussia.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; Furthermore, many of those on the  ''völkisch'' right made much of the fact there were consensual sexual relationships between mostly lower-class women in the Rhineland and "colored" French Army soldiers, attacking these women for bringing the so-called "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" into world and threatening German racial purity.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; In the viewpoint of the Rhinelanders the obsession with relationships between German women and non-white French soldiers was highlighting an aspect of the French occupation that was not to their best advantage, and many of the groups like the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' that at first promoted the story chose to downplay it as the 1920s went on.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; Finally the ''Reich'' government saw its own "Black Horror" propaganda boomerang. Since Germany had been more or less disarmed by the Treaty of Versailles, it was not possible for the ''Reich'' to go to war with France, and the  ''völkisch'' groups opposed to the Weimar Republic used the "black horror" stories as a way of attacking the Weimar Republic as an "emasculated" state incapable of standing up to France; such attacks especially resonated with right-wing men.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; The end of the Ruhr crisis in September 1923 together with the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924 led to an improvement in Franco-German relations, and Berlin had less interest in pursuing "black horror" stories.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=625}} In January 1925, the French pulled out of the northern Rhineland and by this time there were hardly any "colored" troops by the Rhine.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=625}} Despite this, the Canadian feminist [[Rose Henderson]] in a 1925 article in ''The British Columbia Federationist'' wrote "the power of France rests upon a black basis", which she called "one of the most menacing and sinister facts in history", going to condemn the French for training the Senegalese "to subdue and enslave white people".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=492}}

However, the "black horror on the Rhine" did much to shape German views of both the French and Africans. In ''Mein Kampf'', [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote: "7, 000, 000 people languish under alien rule and the main artery of the German people flows through the playground of black African hordes...It was and is the Jews who bring the Negro to the Rhineland, always with the same concealed thought and with the clear goal of destroying by the bastardization of the white race they hate".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} In a 1928 speech, Hitler ranted against the "de-Germanization, Negrification and Judaization of our people".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} In his 1930 book ''The Myth of the 20th Century'', [[Alfred Rosenberg]] denounced France for "contributing to the dehumanization of Europe by the means of blacks, just as had done by introducing Jewish emancipation 140 years ago".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} The "black horror on the Rhine" story featured prominently in Nazi anti-French propaganda and throughout the Third Reich with a recurring image in posters showing French Army soldiers as "a hideous African molesting blonde Aryan women".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} On 29 May 1940 in part of the preparations for an offensive scheduled for 5 June, the Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] ordered a major media campaign to bring back memories of the "Black Horror on the Rhine" as a reason to hate France, saying at a conference that he wanted journalists to run stories that it had been "a cultural and racial disgrace...to bring Negroes to the Rhineland" and to remind German people that the French once again had "colored" soldiers fighting for the republic.{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=103}} During the offensive in June 1940 along the river Somme and during the pursuit into central France, the Wehrmacht massacred thousands of Senegalese taken prisoner to avenge the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=3-4}} In the spring of 1920, the conscience of the world had been stirred by mostly imaginary crimes said to have been committed by the Senegalese against the Germans. Twenty years later in the spring of 1940, nobody cared about the massacres of the Senegalese soldiers by the Germans with the French authorities making little effort after 1945 to prosecute the man responsible.{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=5}} Unlike the alleged "black horror on the Rhine" which received much media coverage, the massacres of Senegalese POWs in June 1940 received little attention either at the time or afterwards with most history books not even mentioning the massacres.

'''Boun Khun Khao''' is an agricultural festival held in rural parts of [[Laos]] at the end of January and beginning of February. The festival celebrates the new harvest. Rice farmers often store the unhusked rice in local temples as part of the celebrations.&lt;ref name="GUIDES2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Cambodia &amp; Laos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xt7kQaNSPMMC&amp;pg=PA234|accessdate=21 July 2012|date=1 June 2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=978-1-4053-4985-7|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Breast pain''' is the symptom of discomfort in the [[breast]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iddon |first1=J |last2=Dixon |first2=JM |title=Mastalgia. |journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |date=13 December 2013 |volume=347 |pages=f3288 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f3288 |pmid=24336097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain that involves both breasts and which occurs repeatedly before the [[menstrual period]] is generally not serious.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHS2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Breast pain |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-pain/ |website=NHS |accessdate=30 October 2018|date=2017-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain that involves only one part of a breast is more concerning.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; It is particular concerning if a hard [[breast mass|mass]] or [[nipple discharge]] is also present.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes may be related to the [[menstrual cycle]], [[birth control pills]], [[hormone therapy]], or [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salzman |first1=B |last2=Fleegle |first2=S |last3=Tully |first3=AS |title=Common breast problems. |journal=American Family Physician |date=15 August 2012 |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=343–9 |pmid=22963023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain may also occur in those with large breasts, during [[menopause]], and in early [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In about 2% of cases breast pain is related to [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=Maz2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mazza |first1=Danielle |title=Women's Health in General Practice |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0729578714 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_Q7IO4ACO1cC&amp;pg=PA189 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis involves [[breast examination|examination]], with [[medical imaging]] if only a specific part of the breast hurts.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Otherwise treatments may include [[paracetamol]] or [[NSAIDs]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; A well fitting [[bra]] may also help.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In those with severe pain [[tamoxifen]] or [[danazol]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; About 70% of women have breast pain at some point in time.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt; Breast pain is one of the most common breast symptom, along with [[breast mass]]es and nipple discharge.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

==Causes==
Cyclical breast pain is often associated with [[fibrocystic breast changes]] or [[duct ectasia]] and thought to be caused by changes of prolactin response to [[thyrotropin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1159/000180038| last1 = Dogliotti| first1 = L| last2 = Faggiuolo| first2 = R| last3 = Ferusso| first3 = A| last4 = Orlandi| first4 = F| last5 = Sandrucci| first5 = S| last6 = Tibo| first6 = A| last7 = Angeli| first7 = A| title = Prolactin and thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in premenopausal women with fibrocystic disease of the breast| journal = Hormone Research| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 137–44| year = 1985| pmid = 3922866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF01658413| last1 = Dogliotti| first1 = L| last2 = Orlandi| first2 = F| last3 = Angeli| first3 = A| title = The endocrine basis of benign breast disorders| journal = World Journal of Surgery| volume = 13| issue = 6| pages = 674–9| year = 1989| pmid = 2696218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with [[menstruation]] and/or [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS).&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

Noncyclical breast pain has various causes and is harder to diagnose. Noncyclical pain has frequently its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in [[puberty]] (both in girls and boys), in [[menopause]] and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include [[alcoholism]] with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), [[mastitis]] and medications such as [[digitalis]], [[methyldopa]] (an [[antihypertensive]]), [[spironolactone]], certain [[diuretic]]s, [[oxymetholone]] (an [[anabolic steroid]]), and [[chlorpromazine]] (a [[typical antipsychotic]]).&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Also, [[shingles]] can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

===Breast cancer===
Some women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear [[breast cancer]]. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer. The great majority of breast cancer cases do not present with symptoms of pain, though breast pain in older women is more likely to be associated with cancer.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cash2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Cash | first = Jill | title = Family practice guidelines | publisher = Springer Publishing | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780826197825 }}, [Electronic book] Section I Guidelines, Chapter Thirteen: Gynecologic Guidelines-Breast Pain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = medline/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis involves [[breast examination]], with [[medical imaging]] if only a specific part of the breast hurts.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Medical imaging by [[ultrasound]] is recommended for all ages, well in those over 30 it is recommended together with [[mammography]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

Ruling out the other possible causes of the pain is one way to differentiate the source of the pain. Breast pain can be due to:

{{div col end}}

Diagnostic testing can be useful. Typical tests used are [[mammogram]], [[excisional biopsy]] for solid lumps, [[fine-needle aspiration]] and biopsy, [[pregnancy test]], [[ultrasonography]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

==Treatment==
In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Otherwise treatments may include [[paracetamol]] or [[NSAIDs]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; A well fitting [[bra]] may also help.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In those with severe pain [[tamoxifen]] or [[danazol]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

[[Bromocriptine]] may be used aswell.&lt;ref name="SchuilingLikis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kerri Durnell Schuiling|author2=Frances E. Likis|title=Women's Gynecologic Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj_ourS3PBMC&amp;pg=PA381|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-5637-6|pages=381–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spironolactone, low dose [[oral contraceptives]], and low-dose [[estrogen]] have helped to relieve pain. Topical anti-inflammatory medications can be used for localized pain. [[Vitamin E]] is not effective in relieving pain nor is [[evening primrose oil]]. [[Vitamin B6|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[vitamin A]] have not been consistently found to be beneficial. [[Flaxseed]] has shown some activity in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia.&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

Pain may be relieved by the use of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or, for more severe localized pain, by [[local anaesthetic]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;&lt;ref name = medline/&gt; Pain may be relieved by reassurance that it does not signal a serious underlying problem, and an active life style can also effect an improvement.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;

Information regarding how the pain is real but not necessarily caused by disease can help to understand the problem. Learning [[breast self-examination]] helps to orient the woman to normal and expected texture and structure of the breast and nipple. [[Yearly breast exams]] may be suggested. [[Counseling]] can also be to describe changes that vary during the monthly cycle. Women on hormone replacement therapy may benefit from a dose adjustment. Another non-pharmacological measure to help relieve symptoms of pain may be to use good bra support. Breasts change during adolescence and menopause and refitting may be beneficial. Applying heat and/or ice can bring relief. Dietary changes may also help with the pain. [[Methylxanthine]]s can be eliminated from the diet to see if a sensitivity is present. Some clinicians recommending a reduction in [[salt]], though no evidence supports this practice.&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

The '''British Ladies' Football Club''' was an all-woman football team formed in the United Kingdom in 1885. The team had as its patron [[Lady Florence Dixie]], an aristocrat from [[Dumfries]], and its first captain was [[Nettie Honeyball]] (real name likely Mary Hutson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Honeyballers: Women who fought to play football|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24176354|website=BBC News|date=26 September 2013|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's first public match took place at [[Crouch End]], London on 23 March 1895, between teams representing 'The North' and 'The South'. The North won 7–1 in front of an estimated 11,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=LFM&gt;{{cite news|title=Ladies' Football Match|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000183/18950325/062/0006|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=The Standard|place=London|date=25 March 1895|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical perspective ==
Until the 19th century, women's participation in football was limited to folk rituals linked with marriage customs. In Inverness, for example, single women would annually play a match with married women, whilst prospective husbands watched from the sidelines.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;Seddon, P. (2004) ''Football Talk: The Language &amp; Folklore of the World's Greatest Game'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7N3iYWotTPYC&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 156] Robson. {{ISBN|1861056834}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The first record of a woman's team coming together to play football occurred on 9 May 1881, at Edinburgh's [[Easter Road Stadium]]. The match was billed as a Scotland v England international and featured [[Mrs Graham's XI]].&lt;ref name=BTF&gt;Domeneghetti, R. (2014) ''From the Back Page to the Front Room: Football's journey through the Englismedia'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lmWLBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PT155#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 155] Ockley Books. {{ISBN|1783015586}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GwB&gt;Tate, T.

Just over a week later, on 20 May 1881,&lt;ref name=GwB/&gt; the teams played in Glasgow in front of a crowd of 5,000. This match had to be abandoned following a violent pitch invasion during which the women were "roughly ", and chased by a mob as they left the grounds.&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; Further games resulted in similar pitch invasions, which soon resulting in ending this early attempt to introduce women's football.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

It is uncertain, from the coverage of the time, what the pitch invasions were in protest against. However, the press tone, which would dominate coverage of women's football for the next century, was clearly established in 1881: barely disguised contempt regarding player appearance, including costume, and the standard of play,&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; overlaid with a certainty that football was a rough man's game unsuitable for women.&lt;ref name=UB&gt;Laycock, S. &amp; Laycock, P.

== Reception ==
The club divided into a north and south team and on 23 March 1895, 10,000{{refn|name=note1|group=notes|Variously reported in newspapers at the time as up to 11,000&lt;ref name=LFM/&gt;}} spectators watched the inaugural game at [[Crouch End]], London. Unlike in the matches of 1881, players no longer had to wear corsets&lt;ref name=TLF/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} and high-heeled boots, but acquired standard man's boots in suitable sizes. They still had to wear bonnets, with the game being stopped if any woman headed the ball and it dislodged either bonnet or hairpin which had to be replaced before the game could resume.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

Despite this, the club went on tour, sponsored by Lady Dixie,&lt;ref name=AGRG/&gt; and in the following two years played some 100 exhibition matches.&lt;ref Name=VFM/&gt; The tour attracted great publicity from the press, though not entirely restricted to the sport as, at the time, women playing football was intricately linked to the [[Women's rights|'Rights question']].&lt;ref name=AGRG/&gt;

The strain of playing so often took its toll, and by September 1896 the ladies could only field a few players. They were also broke, and arriving in [[Exeter]] found they had insufficient funds to either leave or pay their hotel bill. Appeals to the mayor of Exeter fell on deaf ears and he refused to pay. The ladies had to be rescued by friends, and the activities of the club came to an end.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

Women's football once again fell into obscurity until the [[First World War]], when [[Lloyd George]] required women to work in factories whilst the men were at the front. On Christmas Day, 1916, the first recorded match between factory organised women's teams, occurred in [[Ulverston]], Cumbria.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

Nettie Honeyball was well aware of the political ramifications, telling an interviewer that:

::''There is nothing of the farcical nature about the British Ladies' Football Club. I founded the association late last year, with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess my convictions on all matters, where the sexes are so widely divided, are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.''&lt;ref name=TLF/&gt;{{rp|25}}

'''Citizen sourcing''' is the government adoption of [[crowdsourcing]] techniques for the purposes of (1) enlisting citizens in the design and execution of government services and (2) tapping into the citizenry’s [[collective intelligence]] for solutions and [[situational awareness]]. 
Applications of citizen sourcing include:
*The use of [[ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] tools by government agencies to collect ideas and suggestions from the public
*The use of problem-solving tools that allow citizens to identify and evaluate solutions to problems proposed.
*The adoption of citizen reporting platforms, such as for crime or emergency response information
*The government monitoring of [[social media]], such as [[Twitter]], for situational awareness, such as with regard to natural disasters
Citizen sourcing has gained prominence as part of the Obama administration’s [[Open Government Initiative]] and is seen, in the words of [[Vivek Kundra]], as a way of driving “innovation by tapping into the ingenuity of the American people”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=White House Open Government Blog|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/01/23/why-open-gov-matters-you|title=How Open Gov Datasets Affect Parents and Consumers|date=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to solve those problems that are too big for government to solve on its own. Similarly, [[David Cameron]] of the British Conservatives believes that citizen sourcing mechanisms and the advent of [[Web 2.0]] technologies will help usher in “the next age of government” by truly enabling citizens to act on John Kennedy’s historic call to “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=TED|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/david_cameron.html|title=David Cameron: The next age of government|date=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Citizen sourcing is a derivative of the term [[crowdsourcing]]. “Citizen” is used instead of “crowd” to emphasis its governmental application and civic purpose. Citizen sourcing is a new take on the concept of the [[coproduction (public services)|coproduction]] of public services by service users and communities enabled by the maturation of [[Web 2.0]] participatory technologies.

==Examples==

===Online Ideation Platforms for Government===
[http://www.granicus.com Granicus] is an example of a solution that has been implemented in a number of cities like [http://speakupaustin.org/ The City of Austin] that allows the public to submit ideas for government services, improve upon these ideas with the help of government employees that moderate the discussions online, and ultimately design solutions in a crowdsourcing fashion that can be implemented by the city. [[hunchbuzz.com|HunchBuzz]] is another example which has been implemented by New Zealand's central government and is being rolled out to local city councils. [http://citizenlab.co CitizenLab] is a more European-oriented ideation platform on which the citizens co-create their city through ideation and citizensourcing challenges. Their approach to civic engagement is through gamification, in order to incentivise citizens to share their input.

===Citizen reporting===
The City of [[Boston]] provides a Citizens Connect iPhone App that allows constituents to report various services requests, including for removing graffiti, filling potholes, and fixing traffic lights. A similar system, [[SeeClickFix]], has been adopted in a number of cities across the United States.

===Disaster response===
Online communities of citizens such as the Crisis Commons (see [[Crisis camp]]) and the International Network of Crisis Mappers provide assistance to professional responders on the ground by performing data-driven tasks, such as locating missing persons (see, for instance, [[Person finder]]), converting satellite imagery into street maps (see, for instance, [[OpenStreetMap]]), and reporting and processing actionable citizen reports of needs and damage (see, for instance, the [[Ushahidi]] platform).

===Patent examination===
The [[Peer-to-Patent]] system enables citizens to assist the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) in evaluating the validity of patent applications. Following the implementation of Peer-to-Patent, the USPTO started exploring how to further integrate citizens into the patent application review process.  They invited experts to present at two roundtables on using citizen submissions in prior art.  Presenters at the roundtables included experienced representatives from Peer-to-Patent,  Ask Patents, [[Patexia]], and [[Article One Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roundtable on the Use of Crowdsourcing and Third-Party Preissuance Submissions to Identify Relevant Prior Art|url = http://www.uspto.gov/patents/init_events/crowdsourcing_roundtable_04-2014.jsp|website = www.uspto.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30|language = en|first = patent|last = announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roundtable on USPTO Use of Crowdsourcing to Identify Relevant Prior Art|url = http://www.uspto.gov/page/roundtable-uspto-use-crowdsourcing-identify-relevant-prior-art-examination-application|website = www.uspto.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30|language = en|last = Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USPTO also opened the process up to citizens by requesting public comments and suggestions on how to proceed following each of the two roundtables.

===Citizen problem solving===
The City of [http://www.mimedellin.org Medellin], Colombia uses the power of the citizens' collective intelligence to identify potential solutions for important problems the city faces. The platform structures problems as open challenges; citizens can ideate, propose, identify, filter and vote on solutions, and the Mayor´s office reviews and implements solutions of its choosing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41653">The '''coloniality of gender''' is a  concept developed by feminist philosopher [[Maria Lugones|María Lugones]], which she defines as "the analysis of [[racialized]], [[capitalist]], gender oppression", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as "decolonial feminism".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"&gt;Lugones, María. Toward a Decolonial Feminism. Hypatia vol. 25, no. 4 (Fall 2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|747}} Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] occupy an oppositional consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[[Chela Sandoval|Sandoval, Chela]]. US Third World Feminism: the Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World. pp. 1-24. Genders, no. 10, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.

Colonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of  sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being "Two Spirited"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transhealth.phsa.ca/trans-101/two-spirit|title=Two-Spirit - Transgender Health Information Program|work=Transgender Health Information Program|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior. The desire for the colonizer to put forth the idea of gender onto an Indigenous group was to have control over their labor, authority, influence their subjectivity and ideas of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/4640051.pdf|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial / Modern Gender System|last=Lugones|first=María|date=December 12, 2017|website=www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to race, land, and sovereignty ==

According to [[Glen Sean Coulthard]] in his essay ''For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination'', Indigenous resistances against "capitalist imperialism" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the "relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"&gt;Coulthard, Glen Sean.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Coulthard defines this system of relationality as "grounded normativity"&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} stating, "the late Lakota philosopher [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western [[metaphysics]] revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous "philosophies of nonoppression" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies'&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|754, 749}} in her essay ''Toward a Decolonial Feminism'', where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] on Indigenous communities.

According to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as "the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human",&lt;ref name=Foot01/&gt; summarized by Lugones' use of the term "colonial difference".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to "Western man".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as "a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women," which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of "bourgeois European women" as passive reproductive servants of "white bourgeois" male colonizers.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the "colonial difference", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book ''Local Histories/Global Designs''.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|751}}

Logones has stated that colonial notions of [[femininity]] as inversions of [[masculinity]] did not grant human status, but rather established a [[gender dimorphism]] of [[hypersexuality]] and sexual passivity that rendered colonized "men" and "women" as non-human gendered entities.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Through the performance of colonial [[anthropocentrism]] and the disruption of Indigenous [[cosmologies]] of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Lugones writes that through murder and rape,&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}} Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

Within Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is "not an affair of the past";&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752}} as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752–753}} [[Rey Chow]] terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as "the ascendancy of whiteness",&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"&gt;Arvin, Maile; Tuck, Eve; and Morrill, Angie. Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and [[Heteropatriarchy]]. Feminist Formations, vol. 25 No. 1 (Spring 2013). pp. 8-34. Print. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial "settling process" to dispossess "'other-ed' peoples globally".&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt; Instead, Lugones proposes a "feminist border thinking" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|753}} This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as "the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics."&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|755}}

In this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, "Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms."&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt;

== Colonialism of gender in Canada ==
Some researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Cindy|last2=Regina|first2=University of|date=2016|title=Gender, Justice, and the Indian Residential School Claims Process|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/iipj/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.18584/iipj.2016.7.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trafficking of Aboriginal Women and Girls|last=Boyer|first=Yvonne|last2=Kampouris, Peggy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-100-23756-5|location=Canada|pages=5–7 &amp; 31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what  European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be "[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|title=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Stage Three: Displacement and Assimilation|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada.|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071124124236/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|archive-date=November 24, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|title=Report-Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples-Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6 of the ''Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples''|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071115053257/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|archive-date=November 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in 1847 contributed to the [[systemic racism]], violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]] has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourgeois|first=Robyn|date=2015|title=Colonial exploitation: The Canadian state and the trafficking of Indigenous women and girls in Canada.|url=|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=62 |issue=6|pages=1426–1463|via=Hein Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination towards Indigenous ==
The impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that  61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood.&lt;ref name="Trovato"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-demography/|title=Demography of Indigenous People|last=Trovato|first=Frank|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 and 1980, the ''Indian Act'' created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status.&lt;ref name="Trovato"/&gt; Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-womens-issues/|title=Indigenous Women's Issues|last=McNab|first=Miriam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225  unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-national-operational-overview#sec3|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-colonial Indigenous idea of gender ==
Not only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

This drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family. European societies were placed power onto the men and families were patrilinal rather than matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/patrilineal-vs-matrilineal-succession-3529192|title=Patrilineal vs. Matrilineal Succession|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonized societies, men often are the head of the family which allows them to make important decisions while the women are often seen more submissive and plays a supportive role for the men. This contrasted with the Indigenous way of life as Cree women were believed to be the center of life and Iroquois women were given spiritual roles and control over food for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Darcy|date=2009-04-01|title=Colonialism, Gender and the Family in North America: For a Gendered Analysis of Indigenous Struggles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x/abstract|journal=Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=70–88|doi=10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x|issn=1754-9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German philosopher Immanuel Kant comments on the different gender power the Indigenous communities has compared to those who are colonized, as he says "'Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada.

== Colonialism of Gender in Asian ==
===Indonesia===

==== Westernised roles of women ====
Prior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WOMEN IN INDONESIA: Gender, Equity and Development.|last=Robinson &amp; Bessell|first=|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Employment =====
According to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Megawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached. She served as president until 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim women of power gender, politics, and culture in Islam|last=Bennett|first=C|publisher=Continuun|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

===== Education =====
According to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/#section=list-of-countries&amp;ol=info|title=The Global Gender Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters of a Javanese princess|last=Kartini and Symmers|first=Raden Ajeng and A.L.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Economy =====
Women’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children.

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

===== Employment =====
The labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.

===== Economy =====
According to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.gov.hk/download/research/HK_Women2015_e.pdf|title=Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
According to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youth.gov.hk/en/info-centre/education/education-policy.htm|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====
In the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkfw.org/chi/index.php|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
For both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.

===== Community =====
There are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993.  Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/gender-roles-women-modern-japan|title=Gender Roles of Women in Modern Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Japan===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Through modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/643486/japan-female-employment-rate/|title=Female employment rate in Japan from 2007 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

==== Employment ====
The government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fewjapan.com/|title=FEW: For Empowering Women in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
Women participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan  illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors.  The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Japanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.

===== Education =====
In the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students  in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
In the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home
Thus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.

===== Community =====
There are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.”  FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually.

'''Cyberbullying''' or '''cyberharassment''' is a form of [[bullying]] or [[harassment]] using electronic means. Cyberbullying and Cyberharassment are also known as '''online bullying'''. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils|journal=The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x|pmid=18363945 |volume=49|issue=4|pages=376–385|year=2008|last1=Smith|first1=Peter K.|last2=Mahdavi|first2=Jess|last3=Carvalho|first3=Manuel|last4=Fisher|first4=Sonja|last5=Russell|first5=Shanette|last6=Tippett|first6=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying is when someone, typically teens, bully or harass others on social media sites.  Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, [[threats]], sexual remarks, a [[Doxing|victims' personal information]], or pejorative labels (i.e., [[hate speech]]).&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com" /&gt; Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased [[suicidal ideation]], and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt;

Awareness in the United States has risen in the [[2010s]], due in part to high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/nyregion/02suicide.html?_r=0|title=Legal Debate Swirls Over Charges in a Student's Suicide|last=Hu|first=Winnie|date=1 October 2010|work=New York Times|access-date=1 December 2016|publisher=|others=Nate Schweber|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapin|first=John|date=2014-08-17|title=Adolescents and Cyber Bullying: The Precaution Adoption Process Model|journal=Education and Information Technologies|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=719–728|doi=10.1007/s10639-014-9349-1|issn=1360-2357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several US states and other countries have laws specific to cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others use laws extending from the scope of physical harassment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;

[[Internet troll]]ing is a common form of bullying over the Internet in an [[online community]] (such as in [[Online game|online gaming]] or [[social media]]) in order to elicit a reaction, disruption, or for someone's own personal amusement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts" /&gt; Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to [[Stalking|stalk]] a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying. Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in [[peer pressure]], which can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Gwenn Schurgin|last2=Clarke-Pearson|first2=Kathleen|last3=Media|first3=Council on Communications and|date=2011-04-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents, and Families|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/800|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=127|issue=4|pages=800–804|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0054|issn=0031-4005|pmid=21444588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/influence-of-social-media-on-teenagers_b_7427740.html|title=Influence of Social Media on Teenagers|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=2015-05-26|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-teenage-brain-on-social-media|title=The teenage brain on social media|last=Wolpert|first=Stuart|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
A frequently used definition of cyberbullying is "an aggressive, intentional act or behavior that is carried out by a group or an individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Megan A.|date=2014-05-01|title=Cyberbullying|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=168|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3343|pmid=24791741|issn=2168-6203|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many variations of the definition, such as the [[National Crime Prevention Council]]'s more specific definition: "the process of using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cyberbullying is often similar to traditional bullying, with some notable distinctions. Victims of cyberbullying may not know the identity of their bully, or why the bully is targeting them. The harassment can have wide-reaching effects on the victim, as the content used to harass the victim can be spread and shared easily among many people and often remains accessible long after the initial incident.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettalia|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Levin|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Dickinson|first3=Joël|date=2013-11-01|title=Cyberbullying: Eliciting harm without consequence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213002586|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2758–2765|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "cyberharassment" and "cyberbullying" are sometimes used synonymously, though some people use  the latter to refer specifically to harassment among minors or in a school setting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=735549|title=Protection of Children Online: Federal and State Laws Addressing Cyberstalking, Cyberharassment, and Cyberbullying|last=Smith|first=Alison M.|date=5 September 2008|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|id=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberstalking===
{{further|Cyberstalking}}
Cyberstalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to [[Stalking|stalk]] a victim. This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim's safety. Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass. They may encourage others to do the same, either explicitly or by impersonating their victim and asking others to contact them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trolling ===
{{Further|Internet troll}}
Internet trolls intentionally try to provoke or offend others in order to elicit a reaction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=Fernando L.|year=2016|title=Trolling &amp; the First Amendment: Protecting Internet Speech in the Era of Cyberbullies &amp; Internet Defamation|url=|journal=University of Illinois Journal of Law, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=|pages=135–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trolls and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals: while some trolls engage in cyberbullying, others may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief. A troll may be disruptive either for their own amusement or because they are genuinely a combative person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/what-an-academic-who-wrote-her-dissertation-on-trolls-thinks-of-violentacrez/263631/|title = What an Academic Who Wrote Her Dissertation on Trolls Thinks of Violentacrez|date = October 15, 2012|accessdate = |website = The Atlantic|publisher = |last = Phillips|first = Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuals to educate the public, teachers and parents summarize, "Cyberbullying is being cruel to others by sending or posting harmful material using a cell phone or the internet." Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Research has identified basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender. It may also include public actions such as repeated [[threat]]s, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e. [[hate speech]]) or defamatory false accusations, ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining a Cyberbully|url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121847|publisher=The National Science Foundation|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials defaming or humiliating them.&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com"&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/ Cyberbullying – Law and Legal Definitions] US Legal&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) on websites or forums—called [[doxing]], or may use [[impersonation]], creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. This can leave the cyberbully anonymous, which can make it difficult for them to be caught or punished for their behavior, although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity. Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said is hurtful.

The recent rise of smartphones and mobile apps have yielded a more accessible form of cyberbullying. It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will occur more often than through more stationary internet platforms. In addition, the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms. It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of types cyberbullying than those who are exclusively bullied elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Görzig|first=Anke|author2=Lara A. Frumkin|title=Cyberbullying experiences on-the-go: When social media can become distressing|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=7|issue=1|year=2013|url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2013022801&amp;article=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teens argue that some events categorized as cyberbullying are simply drama. Danah Boyd writes, "teens regularly used that word [drama] to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy-driven relational aggression. Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying, teens saw them as drama."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. (2014). Bullying is social media amplifying meanness and cruelty? In It's Complicated the social lives of networked teens (p. 137). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In social media ===
Cyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. "By 2008, 93% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/millennials/teen-internet-use-graphic/ |title=Teen and Young Adult Internet Use |work=Pew Internet Project |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade has witnessed a surge of cyberbullying, bullying that occurs through the use of electronic communication technologies, such as e-mail, instant messaging, social media, online gaming, or through digital messages or images sent to a cellular phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kowalski, Giumetti, Schroeder &amp; Lattanner|first=R.

There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year,{{when|date=December 2017}} while 90 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media, and 35 percent have done so frequently. 95 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior, and 55 percent have witnessed this frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetsafety101.org/cyberbullyingstatistics.htm |title=Cyberbullying Statistics |work=Internet Safety 101 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 Pew Research study, eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past. This includes their location, images, and contact information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |accessdate=15 November 2015|date=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect children, it is important that personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, phone number, etc. be kept confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highya.com/articles-guides/stranger-danger-protecting-your-children-from-cyber-bullying-sexting-and-social-media |title=Stranger Danger: Protecting Your Children from Cyber Bullying, Sexting, &amp; Social Media |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two studies from 2014 found that 80% of body-shaming [[Twitter|tweets]] are sent by women, while they also accounted for 50% of [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] tweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36380247|title=Twitter abuse - '50% of misogynistic tweets from women'|date=2016-05-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/staggering-scale-of-social-media-misogyny-mapped-in-new-demos-study/|title=New Demos study reveals scale of social media misogyny - Demos|website=www.demos.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can also take place through the use of websites belonging to certain groups to effectively request the targeting of another individual or group.

Of those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll, 16% said the most recent incident had occurred in an online game.&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/30/5-facts-about-online-harassment/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=5 facts about online harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from National Sun Yat-sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Paths to Bullying in Online Gaming: The Effects of Gender, Preference for Playing Violent Games, Hostility, and Aggressive Behavior on Bullying|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|volume=47|issue=3|pages=235–249|doi=10.2190/ec.47.3.a|year=2013|last1=Yang|first1=Shu Ching}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study that discusses the direct correlation between exposure to violent video games and cyber bullying also took into account personal factors such as "duration of playing online games, alcohol consumption in the last 3 months, parents drunk in the last 3 months, anger, hostility, ADHD, and a sense of belonging"&lt;ref&gt;Lam L, Cheng Z and Liu X, 'Violent Online Games Exposure And Cyberbullying/Victimization Among Adolescents' (2013) 16 Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking&lt;/ref&gt; as potential contributing factors of cyberbullying.

Gaming was a more common venue for men in which to experience harassment, whereas women's harassment tended to occur via social media.&lt;ref name="washpoPewGamergate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/10/23/gamergate-and-how-internet-users-think-about-gaming-and-harassment/|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|work=The Washington Post|title=Gamergate and how Internet users think about gaming and harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most respondents considered [[gaming culture]] to be equally welcoming to both genders, though 44% thought it favored men.&lt;ref name="nprPewLeastWelcoming"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/22/357826882/pew-gaming-is-least-welcoming-online-space-for-women|last=Hu|first=Elise|publisher=NPR|work=All Tech Considered|title=Pew: Gaming Is Least Welcoming Online Space For Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keza MacDonald writes in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that [[sexism in gaming|sexism exists in gaming culture]], but is not mainstream within it.&lt;ref name="guardianReallySexist"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/06/are-gamers-really-sexist|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|title=Are gamers really sexist?|date=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women, sex role stereotyping, and overaggressive language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gender Stereotypes, Aggression, and Computer Games: An Online Survey of Women|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=7|issue=6|pages=714–27|doi=10.1089/cpb.2004.7.714|pmid=15687807|year=2004|last1=Norris|first1=Kamala O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] made reference to the harassment of women gamers during his remarks in honor of Women's History Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/remarks-president-reception-honor-womens-history-month|title=Remarks by the President at Reception in Honor of Women's History Month|date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitive gaming scenes have been less welcoming of women than has broader gaming culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/women-are-gamers-but-largely-absent-from-e-sports/|work=Ars Technica|last=Johnston|first=Casey|title=Women are gamers, but largely absent from "e-sports"|date=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an internet-streamed fighting game competition, one female gamer forfeited a match after the coach of her team, Aris Bakhtanians, stated, "The sexual harassment is part of the culture.

Some game developers have been subjected to harassment and death threats by players upset by changes to a game or by a developer's online policies.&lt;ref name="polygonPlague"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/15/4622252/plague-of-game-dev-harassment-erodes-industry-spurs-support-groups|last=Crecente|first=Brian|work=Polygon|title=Plague of game dev harassment erodes industry, spurs support groups|date=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment also occurs in reaction to critics such as [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] or [[Anita Sarkeesian]], whom some fans see as threats to the medium.&lt;ref name="guardianCriticismCensorship"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/30/gamers-criticism-censorship|last=Jenkins|first=Ria|journal=The Guardian|title=When will gamers understand that criticism isn't censorship?|date=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psmagGamerProblem" /&gt; Various people have been harassed in connection with the [[Gamergate controversy]].&lt;ref name="observerBlameGamergate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/10/blame-gamergates-bad-rep-on-smears-and-shoddy-journalism/|last=Young|first=Cathy|work=New York Observer|title=Blame GamerGate's Bad Rep on Smears and Shoddy Journalism|date=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment related to gaming is not of a notably different severity or tenor compared to online harassment motivated by other subcultures or advocacy issues.&lt;ref name="psmagGamerProblem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/online-harassment-women-isnt-just-gamer-problem-90518|last=Berlatsky|first=Noah|work=Pacific Standard|title=Online Harassment of Women Isn't Just a Gamer Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabotage among rival [[crowdfunding]] campaigns is a recurring problem for projects related to gaming.&lt;ref name="lifehackerCrowdfunding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/08/crowdsourcing-tends-to-attract-the-worst-kind-of-people/|last=Jager|first=Chris|work=Lifehacker|publisher=Gawker Media|title=Crowdsourcing Tends To Attract The Worst Kind Of People|date=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of [[swatting]] in games such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[League of Legends]]'' have resulted in law enforcement [[SWAT]] units called on individuals' homes as a prank. On December 28, 2017, [[Wichita, Kansas]] police officers killed Andrew Finch at his Kansas home in a reported swatting prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article192111974.html|title=Call of Duty gaming community points to ‘swatting’ in deadly Wichita police shooting|last=Manna|first=Nicole|date=2017-12-29|work=The Wichita Eagle|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In search engines ===
[[Information cascade]]s happen when users start passing along information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. This can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their [[personalized search|tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests]]. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes /&gt;

Bullies use [[Google bomb]]s (a term applicable to any search engine){{citation needed|date=June 2016}} to increase the prominence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches, done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible. Examples include the [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"]] organized by the [[LGBT]] lobby. Google bombs can manipulate the Internet's search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are, but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crimes in Cyberspace|last = Citron|first = Danielle|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2014 |location = Cambridge, Mass., USA &amp; London, UK|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wmiABAAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0-674-36829-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement ==
A majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gregorie|first1=Trudy|title=Cyberstalking: dangers on the information superhighway|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/cyberstalking---dangers-on-the-information-superhighway.pdf?sfvrsn=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx|title=Cyberstalking, cyberharassment and cyberbullying|website=NCSL National Conference of State Legislatures|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906024827/http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/cyberstalking-and-cyberharassment-laws.aspx|archive-date=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.61.260 Cyberstalking] Washington State Legislature&lt;/ref&gt; Most law enforcement agencies have cyber-crime units, and Internet stalking is often treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Back Off, Bully!|url = |last = Bailey|first = Melissa|date = May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Cyberstalking?|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/people/engl/blackmon/101cresources/cyberstalking.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227054307/http://www.cla.purdue.edu/people/engl/blackmon/101cresources/cyberstalking.htm|archivedate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Help and resources can be searched by state or area.

=== Schools ===
The safety of schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006–2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609000529/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx |date=June 9, 2013 }} Legislation by State, NCSL&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives and curriclulum requirements also exist in the UK (the [[Ofsted eSafety guidance]]) and Australia ([[Overarching Learning Outcome 13]]).

In 2012, a group of teenagers in a design class [[New Haven, Connecticut]] developed an application to help fight bullying, "Back Off Bully" (BOB). This is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad. When someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening, as well as providing positive action and empowerment regarding the incident. The reported information goes to a database, where it may be studied by administrators. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ CT teens develop bullying app to protect peers] 7 News; June 2012 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622100810/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Back Off Bully" is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across Connecticut, while recent studies carried out among 66 high school teachers have concluded that prevention programs have proved ineffective to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/pits.21603 | volume=49| issue=4|year=2012|journal=Psychology in the Schools|pages=352–367 | last1 = Stauffer | first1 = Sterling |title = High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies| last2 = Allen Heath | first2 = Melissa | last3 = Marie Coyne | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Ferrin | first4 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers can also be cyberbullied by pupils,&lt;ref name=durangoherald20151029/&gt;&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a/&gt; as well as by parents and other school staff.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-11-08a/&gt;

=== Protection ===
There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators, as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws] WHOA&lt;/ref&gt; It also lists those states that do not yet have laws, and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ The Global Cyber Law Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620182226/http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ |date=June 20, 2012 }} GCLD&lt;/ref&gt; Some states such as Florida, California, and Missouri have developed state laws against Cyberbullying. California has the Safe Place to Learn Act and also has a law that states "the use of an electronic device to cause someone to fear for their life" can be charged with a misdemeanor which can be punishable to up to one year in prison. In Florida, the "Jeffrey Johnson Stand Up for All Students Act" prohibits any type of bullying and does speak on cyberbullying. In Missouri, anyone who violently threatens someone over social media can be convicted with a Class A misdemeanor, but if the victim is seventeen years or younger,they can be convicted with a Class D felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/cyber-bullying.html|title=Cyberbullying Laws - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age ===
Children report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade. According to research, boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDonald|first1=Gregg|title=Cyber-bullying defies traditional stereotype: Girls are more likely than boys to engage in this new trend, research suggests|work=Fairfax Times|date=September 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526084157/http://ww2.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078 |url=http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078|archivedate=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the bully is male or female, the purpose is to intentionally embarrass, harass, intimidate, or make threats online.

Studies on the psycho-social effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the effects cyberbullying may have on the victims. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect online and offline behavior. Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could potentially  be positive. Victims "created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people."&lt;ref name="cyberpsychology.eu"&gt;[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2011121901&amp;article=4 Cyberbullying in Adolescent Victims: Perception and Coping] Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ''Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace'' abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme effects included [[self-harm]]. Children have killed each other and committed [[suicide]] after cyberbullying incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |title=Stop Cyberbullying |publisher=Stop Cyberbullying |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of digital self-harm have been reported, in which an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves, or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|title=Cyberbullying on social networks spawning form of self-harm|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/06/cyberbullying-social-networks-self-harm|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Englander|first=Elizabeth|title=Digital Self-Harm: Frequency, Type, Motivations, and Outcomes|journal=MARC Research Reports|date=June 2012|volume=5|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/marc_reports/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults ===
Cyberstalking may be an extension of physical stalking,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/australian_covert_bullying_prevalence_study_chapter_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and may have criminal consequences. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action. Among factors that motivate stalkers are [[envy]], pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life, or the desire to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior. The stalker may be [[delusional]] and believe he/she "knows" the target. The stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status, or may  believe they can get away with these actions (anonymity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |author=Wayne Petherick |title=Cyber-Stalking:Obsessional Pursuit and the Digital Criminal |date=2009 |work=TrueTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209045152/http://trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |archivedate=February 9, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to helping adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiredsafety.org/subjects/cyberbullying.php Cyberbullying] Stalking and Harassment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/what-cyberbullies-adults-11081994.html What to Do About Cyberbullies: For Adults], by Rena Sherwood; YAHOO Contributor network&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Study (ACBPS). Child Health Promotion Research Centre, Edith Cowan University, Perth]. Deewr.gov.au. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; assessed cyberbullying experiences among 7,418 students. Rates of cyberbullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyberbullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.

=== China ===
In mainland China, cyberbullying has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. A study investigating the risk factors of cyberbullying sampled 1438 high school students from central China. Data  showed that 34.84% had participated in bullying and 56.88% had been bullied online.&lt;!-- (Commenting this out until it's rewritten in a way that makes sense.)

It is common among high school students (28 out of 36 students) to participate in social media platforms. 58% admitted to changing a nickname for others, 56.3% to humiliation, 54.2% to making fun of someone, and 54.2% to spreading rumors. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed 1820 teenagers, 17.5% of whom indicated having experienced cyberbullying. This included insults, abuse, and the publishing of personal private pictures on social media without permission.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== European Union ===
In a study published in 2011, across 25 [[European Union|EU]] member states studied, an average 6% of children (9–16 years old) had been bullied and only 3% of them confessed to having been a bully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/EUKidsOnline/EU%20Kids%20II%20(2009-11)/EUKidsOnlineIIReports/D5%20Patterns%20of%20risk.pdf|title = Patterns of risk and safety online.

=== Finland ===
Sourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the previous six months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were victims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims.

The authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying as well as cybervictimization is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but psychosomatic issues. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a worldwide problem that needs to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sourander, A. |author2=Klomek, A.B. |author3=Ikonen, M. |author4=Lindroos, J. |author5=Luntamo, T. |author6=Koskeiainen, M. |author7=Helenius, H. |title=Psychosocial risk factors associated with cyberbullying among adolescents: A population-based study|year=2010|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=67|issue=7|pages=720–728|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/67/7/720|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.79 |pmid=20603453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks.)The journal article titled "Exploring traditional and cyberbullying among Irish adolescents" studies by --&gt;The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) pilot survey was carried out in eight post-primary schools across Ireland, including 318 students aged 15–18. 59% were boys and 41% were girls. Participation in this survey was voluntary for students, and consent had to be obtained from parents, students and the school itself. This survey was anonymous and confidential, and took 40 minutes to complete. It asked questions on traditional forms of bullying as well as cyberbullying, risk behaviours and self-reported health and [[life satisfaction]].

66% of the students said that they had never been bullied. 14% had been victims of traditional forms of bullying. 10% had been victims of cyberbullying, and the remaining 10% had been victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying.

=== Japan ===
According to recent{{when|date=December 2017}} research, in Japan, 17 percent (compared with a 25-country average of 37 percent) of youth between the ages of 8 and 17 have been victims of online bullying. The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan. Teenagers who spend more than 10 hours a week on the Internet are more likely to become the targets of online bullying. Only 28 percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is. However, they do know the severity of the issue; 63 percent of the surveyed students worried about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;Cross-Tab Marketing Services &amp; Telecommunications Research Group for Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media, they become easy targets for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying may occur via email, text, chat rooms, and social media websites. Some cyberbullies set up websites or blogs to post the target's images, publicize their personal information, gossip about the target, express why they hate the target, request people to agree with the bully's view, and send links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Marilyn A. (2005). Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?&lt;/ref&gt;

Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression, which involves alienating the victim from peers through gossip or ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sugimori Shinkichi |year=2012 |url=http://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00054/|title=Anatomy of Japanese Bullying|work=nippon.com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities. One 19-year-old Japanese student was targeted by classmates who posted his photo online, insulted him constantly, and asked him to die. Because of the constant harassment, he did attempt suicide twice. Even when he quit school, the attacks did not stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Cyber-bullying-bedevils-Japan/2007/11/12/1194766557213.html|title=Cyber bullying bedevils Japan|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims. They often feel anxious, nervous, tired, and depressed. Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends. Psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches, skin problems, abdominal pain, sleep problems, bed-wetting, and crying. It may also lead victims to commit suicide to end the bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psusd.us/CyberBullying-StudentAwareness Cyber Bullying: Student Awareness] Palm Springs Unified School District Retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of 2005 of approximately 1,500 Internet-using adolescents and found that over one-third of youth reported being victimized online, and over 16% of respondents admitted to cyberbullying others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics on Bullying |url=http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1583136/File/Departmental%20Content/cyber%20bullying/lesson%202/cbms_2_tr1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224632/http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1583136/File/Departmental%20Content/cyber%20bullying/lesson%202/cbms_2_tr1.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the instances of cyberbullying involved relatively minor behavior (41% were disrespected, 19% were called names), over 12% were physically threatened and about 5% were scared for their safety. Notably, fewer than 15% of victims told an adult about the incident.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt; Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in 2007&lt;ref name="patchin2"&gt;Hinduja, S. &amp; Patchin, J.

The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.

Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyberbullying [[victimization]] for fear their access to technology will be taken from them; while 24% and 14% told a parent or teacher respectively, 28% did not tell anyone, and 41% told a friend.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a [[Stanford University]] master's student, created ''[[Adina's Deck]]'', a film based on Stanford-accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyberbullying in northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyberbullied and were victims of cyberbullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]] is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.

They also reported findings from a then-recent study of cyberbullying.

In 2014, Mehari, Farrell, and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents. They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person. Mehari et al. suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new classification of aggression, rather than considering cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression. They suggest that future research on cyberbullying should be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/psyc_pubs/15/|title = Cyberbullying among adolescents: Measures in search of a construct|last = Mehari|first = Krista|date = 2014|journal = Psychology of Violence|doi = 10.1037/a0037521|pmid = |access-date = March 24, 2015|last2 = Farrell|first2 = Albert|last3 = Le|first3 = Anh-Thuy|volume=4|issue = 4|pages=399–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying on social media has usually been student-to-student, but recently, students have been cyberbullying their teachers. High school students in Colorado created a Twitter site that bullies teachers.

=== Gender ===
Research conducted to try and determine differences in cyber bullying patterns comparing male to female and ages of each are relatively inconclusive.  There are some factors that lean towards males being more involved in cyber bullying behaviors due to males tending to have more aggressive behaviors than females.&lt;ref&gt;Uncovering the Structure of and Gender and Developmental Differences in Cyber Bullying.

Comparatively, the review of articles indicates that age differences have some indicators of cyber bullying; increasing age indicates increasing bullying behaviors.  Gender differences have mixed results but one finding indicated that younger females(10 or 11) and older males(13+) tend to engage in cyber bullying behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;A meta-analysis of sex differences in cyber-bullying behavior: The moderating role of age.

CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there is currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to [[Parry Aftab]], but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to "coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress."

In August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. Assembly Bill 86 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbusd.us/vnews/display.v/ART/4cd41cda558da%3C|title=Fort Bragg USD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying, offline or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerdigitaled.com/edtech/Education-Legislation-Cyber-Bullying.html |title=Education Legislation: Cyber-Bullying |publisher=Centerdigitaled.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law took effect on January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/31/AR2008123103067.html|title=States Passing Laws to Combat Cyber-Bullying&amp;nbsp;— washingtonpost.com|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 2, 2009|last=Surdin|first=Ashley | date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in ''[[People v. Marquan M.]]''

A recent{{when|date=December 2017}} ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) to be liable for the content of the sites it hosts, setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5624 International IT and e-commerce legal info].

While some states have laws that require schools to mediate cyberbullying conflicts, several states have been sued on First Amendment grounds for doing so. By examining the decisions of three such lawsuits heard in lower courts, Alvin J. Primack and Kevin A. Johnson argued that current First Amendment doctrine, particularly the case of ''Morse v. Frederick'' (2007), may offer interpretive resources for justifying administrative reach to some online digital speech. They concluded, "[w]ithout clearer standards, school administrators are likely to feel constrained and err on the side of inaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=Alvin J.|last2=Johnson|first2=Kevin A.|date=Spring 2017|title=Student cyberbullying inside the digital schoolhouse gate: Toward a standard for determining where a "School" is|journal=First Amendment Studies|volume=51.1|pages=30–48|doi=10.1080/21689725.2016.1278177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

Since the 1990s, the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve [[workplace bullying]] since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying. The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier.&lt;ref name=european-perspective&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullying, Harassment and Stress in the Workplace — A European Perspective|url=http://www.internationallaborlaw.com/files/2013/01/Bullying-Harassment-and-Stress-in-the-workplace-A-European-Perspective.pdf|publisher=  Proskauer|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 24-hour internet connection gives bullies a neverending opportunity to find and bully victims. Employers in the European Union have more legal responsibility to their employees than do those in other countries. Since employers do not have the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States, employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated.

In 2007, the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work, a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditions.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting his or her employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours. Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use the Ordinance on Victimization at Work law, since there are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 1993, Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying. The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from "recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community".&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 2002, France passed the Social Modernization Law, which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The legislation defines "moral harassment" as "repeated acts leading to a
deterioration of the working conditions and that are likely to harm the dignity, the physical or
psychological heath of the victim or his professional career."&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

The United Kingdom does not have anti-bullying legislation. However, it does have the Protection From Harassment Act, an anti-stalking law.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; U.K. courts have used this legislation in bullying cases.

[[File:Take A Stand Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image portrays the support and awareness that many anti-cyberbullying campaigns have in some countries around the world.]]
The United States and some other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union. Cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically in number.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; However, the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim's need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying.

As of mid-2015, countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating laws specially related to cyberbullying. Since the process takes time, the government is supporting school programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory guidance – Keeping children safe in education|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping safeguard students from cyberbullying as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New guidelines to help industry promote internet safety|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-guidelines-to-help-industry-promote-internet-safety|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education &amp; Tim Loughton|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on preventative legislation ===
{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}

Researchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying. These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly.&lt;ref name= von&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Von Marees | first1 = N. | last2 = Petermann | first2 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: An increasing challenge for schools | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 33 | issue = 5| page = 476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully, such as blocking messages or increasing the security of their computer.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

Even in a perfect world, no crime can be stopped fully. That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method, effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted. As with any crime, people learn to cope with what has happened. People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying. Coping strategies may include social support groups composed of victims of cyberbullying,&lt;ref name= von /&gt; which could allow students to share their stories, and remove the feeling of being alone.

Teachers should be involved in all prevention educational models, as they are essentially the "police" of the classroom. Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation.&lt;ref name= von /&gt; However, if given the proper tools with preventative measures and more power in the classroom, teachers can be of assistance. If the parent, teacher, and victim can work together, solutions may be found.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying. Some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying (including terms such as "libel" and "slander"). The problem is that the existing legislation does not directly apply to bullying, nor define it as its own criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, S. M. (2010). Cybercrime in Canadian criminal law. (pp. 105–122). Toronto, ON: Carswell.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-cyberbullying advocates have even expressed concern about the broad scope of some of the bills attempted to be passed.&lt;ref name= walt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walther | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: Holding grownups liable for negligent entrustment | url = | journal = Houston Law Review | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 531–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attempts have been made to pass legislation against cyberbullying. Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying. Problems include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and, if charges are pressed, whether this violates the bully's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt; B. Walther said that "Illinois is the only state to criminalize 'electronic communication(s) sent for the purpose of harassing another person' when the activity takes place outside a public school setting." This was criticized for infringement on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt;

'Cyberbullying' is the use of technology to bully a person, or threatening an individual online. Cyberbullying has become more common nowadays because of all the technology that children have access to. The most common apps that teenagers use to cyberbully are Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. Cyberbullying has become harder to stop because parents and teachers are unaware of when and where it is happening. Online bullying has become a bigger problem and 33% of all youth has been a victim of cyberbullying. Teens will say awful things to one another online and what they do not realize is that once it is said and published online it will not go away. Home used to be a safe place for teens but now a child is still within reach of becoming a victim of cyberbullying- whether it is through YouTube, Ask.fm, or a text message.

Preventing a child from being cyberbullied is hard, but now they are working to form laws to help stop the issue from getting worse than it already is. They have created movies such as 'Cyberbully' by Charles Biname and 'The Duff' by Ari Sandel for teenagers to watch and see how cyberbullying can affect an individual. Parents can become more involved in their children's lives when it comes to social media to help prevent their child from being bullied. Children that are victims of this problem feel they can not go to an adult for help because they may feel embarrassed by the situation. Bullying online will not only hurt the teenager emotionally but there is also a risk of the child hurting themselves physically as well. Suicide has become the 3rd leading cause of death among persons from 10 to 24 years of age and online bullying takes a big part in that.

Being able to tell if a child is being hurt from this issue can be tough, but there are certain things that a child will do that should give a red flag that they are being bullied. Such as if they post a video or a picture on Instagram with comments like "Am I ugly? Someone said I was but is it true?" or "Am I cute?". A cyberbully could have said nasty words to that child and the victim could be looking for compliments. If the victim is always online wondering when the bully will strike next that could also be a sign. Being an active parent in their children's lives will make a difference on whether your child is experiencing online bullying or not. Also bringing police involved in the case will be a problem solver too.

== Harmful effects ==
Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin" /&gt; Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; Cyberbullying may be more harmful than traditional bullying, because there is no escaping it.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032718/http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |archivedate=August 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, which is often the very intention of the bully.

Cyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States in which cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; The [[suicide of Megan Meier]] is a recent example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks. Holly Grogan committed suicide by jumping off a 30-foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK. It was reported that a number of her schoolmates had posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=49|issue=4|page=352|doi=10.1002/pits.21603|year=2012|last1=Stauffer|first1=Sterling|last2=Heath|first2=Melissa Allen|last3=Coyne|first3=Sarah Marie|last4=Ferrin|first4=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucie Russell, director of campaigns, policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds, young people who suffer from [[mental disorder]]s are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out, they're able to put a block between that and their self-esteem. But mentally unwell people don't have the strength and the self-esteem to do that, to separate it, and so it gets compiled with everything else. To them, it becomes the absolute truth – there's no filter, there's no block. That person will take that on, take it as fact.&lt;ref name="Guardian8813"&gt;{{cite news|title = Cyberbullying websites should be boycotted, says Cameron: Prime minister calls for website operators to 'step up to the plate', following death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 8 August 2013|author = Alexandra Topping|author2 = Ellen Coyne and agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/article/20120427/CARLYLE0101/304279977/-1/carlyle/cyber-bullying-and-popular-culture|title=Cyber-bullying and popular culture|author=Kelly Running|work=Carlyle Observer|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation, emotional damage, and suicide ===
According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, "there have been several high‐profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide – suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression."

Cyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse, whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying.&lt;ref name="cyberthreat"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Ideas and Discoveries (magazine)|Ideas and Discoveries]] |title=Cyberthreat: How to protect yourself from online bullying | year=2011 | page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by ''USA Today'' and the ''Baltimore Examiner''. These include the [[suicide of Ryan Halligan]] and the [[suicide of Megan Meier]], the latter of which resulted in ''[[United States v. Lori Drew]]''. Teen suicides tied to cyberbullying have recently become more prevalent. Rebecca Ann Sedwick committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as [[Ask.fm]], [[Kik Messenger]] and [[Voxer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=Girl's Suicide Points to Rise in Apps Used by Cyberbullies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/us/suicide-of-girl-after-bullying-raises-worries-on-web-sites.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On youth and teenagers ===
The effects of cyberbullying vary, but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying"&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of Bullying|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/|website=StopBullying.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer N. Caudle, a certified family physician, says, "Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness and poor sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber-Bullying and its Effect on our Youth|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/cyber-bullying.aspx|website=American Osteopathic Association|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image shows different aspects of cyberbullying that can take place on the internet which puts more emotional strain on the younger children and teenage who experience cyberbullying.]]

Most of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deniz|first1=Metin|title=A Study on Primary School Students' Being Cyber Bullies and Victims According to Gender, Grade, and Socioeconomic Status|journal=Croatian Journal of Education|date=7 July 2015|volume=17|issue=3|pages=659–680|doi=10.15516/cje.v17i3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet, but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Metin Deniz believes cyberbullying will "become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, and relationships with others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The risk of suicide increases by 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life, and cyberbullying amplifies the situation.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;

Young people seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of cyberbullying through [[anonymous social media]], perhaps because adolescents are attracted to these platforms as a means of seeking validation from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Odd Girl Out|last=Simmons|first=Rachel|publisher=Mariner Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse on these platforms, such as [[ASKfm]], [[Yik Yak]] and [[Sarahah]], can be particularly keenly felt by young people, leading to issues of loss of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Binns|first=Amy|date=2013|title=Facebook's Ugly Sisters: Anonymity and abuse on Formspring and Ask.fm|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/8378/|journal=Media Education Research Journal|volume=4 | issue = 1 |page=27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of suicides related to bullying on these platforms in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/family-friends-shocked-at-cyberposts-after-teen-s-death-1.1827393|title=Family and Friends shocked at cyberposts after teen's death|last=Polsky|first=Carol|date=23 March 2010|website=Newsday|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/8653867/Teenager-in-rail-suicide-was-sent-abusive-message-on-social-networking-site.html|title=Teenager in rail suicide was sent abusive message on social networking site|last=|first=|date=22 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness ==

=== Campaigns ===

==== International ====
The Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of [[online bullying]], abuse, and hate campaigns. It was founded in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, social isolation, [[self-harm]] and suicides devastating lives around the world. Cybersmile provides support to victims and their friends and families through social media interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, [[Stop Cyberbullying Day]], to draw attention to the issue.

==== Spain ====
Multiple non-profit organizations fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the ''Protégeles'', ''PantallasAmigas'', ''[[Foundation Alia2]]'', the non-profit initiative ''Actúa Contra el Ciberacoso'', the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the ''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos'', the ''Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta'', the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts. The government of [[Castile and León]] has also created a ''Plan de Prevención del Ciberacoso y Promoción de la Navegación Segura en Centro Escolares'', and the government of the [[Canary Islands]] has created a portal on the phenomenon called ''Viveinternet''.

==== United States ====
In March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new [[public service advertising]] campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyberbullying.

As of 2008, the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s 2008 edition of ''[[Boy Scout Handbook|The Boy Scout Handbook]]'' addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#First Class|First Class]] rank requirements adds: "Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet. Describe a cyberbully and how you should respond to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, [[KTTV]] Fox 11 News in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyberbullying on sites like [[Stickam]] by people who call themselves "[[Anonymous (group)|/b/rothas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai09cWlyPrQ|publisher = Fox 11|title = Leelila Strogov – Fox 11 LA – Cyber Bullies|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had put out a report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying, titled "Hackers on Steroids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY|publisher = Fox Television Stations, Inc.|title = FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous'|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2008, parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, [[Verizon]], MySpace, [[Microsoft]], and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves and their personal reputations, children and businesses from online harassment. Sponsors of the conference included [[McAfee]], [[AOL]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], WiredTrust, Children's Safety Research and Innovation Centre, and KidZui.com. Cyberharassment versus cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference; abusive internet behavior by adults with the repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as [[stalking]] harassment, versus bullying by teens and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Skylar |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2009/10/cal-state-fullerton-student-causes-crash/comment-page-46/ |title=2 dead after head-on collision with CSUF student |publisher=Dailytitan.com |date= 2009-10-26|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organized movement to make [[revenge porn]] illegal began in August 2012: End Revenge Porn.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/|title=End Revenge Porn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently revenge porn is only illegal in two states, but the demand for its criminalization is on the rise as digital technology has increased in the past few generations.  The organization seeks to provide support for victims, educate the public, and gain activist support to bring new legislation before the United States Government.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org" /&gt;

In 2006, PACER.org created a week-long event that was held once a year in October. Today, the campaign is a month-long event and is now known as the National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzog, J.
(2015, October 5). October is National Bullying Prevention Awareness
Month. Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.stopbullying.gov/blog/2015/10/05/october-national-bullying-prevention-awareness-month&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
Originating in Canada, [[Anti-Bullying Day]] is a day of celebration for those who choose to participate wearing a symbol of colours (pink, blue or purple) as a stance against bullying.  A British Columbia teacher founded the Stop A Bully movement, which uses pink wristbands to represent the wearer's stance to stop bullying.

Pink Shirt Day was inspired by David Shepherd and Travis Price. Their high school friends organized a protest in sympathy for a Grade 9 boy who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Their stance from wearing pink has been a huge inspiration in the Great Vancouver Mainland. "We know that victims of bullying, witnesses of bullying and bullies themselves all experience the very real and long term negative impacts of bullying regardless of its forms – physical, verbal, written, or on-line (cyberbullying)".

ERASE (Expect Respect and A Safe Education) is an initiative started by the province of British Columbia to foster safe schools and prevent bullying. It builds on already-effective programs set up by the provincial government to ensure consistent policies and practices regarding the prevention of bullying.

=== Community support ===
A number of organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for this escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyberbullying and cyberharassment. Anti-bullying charity [[Act Against Bullying]] launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.

In 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth (BeatBullying), using the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7098978.stm YouTube tackles bullying online] BBC News, November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a 17-year-old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyberbullying, she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of [[eBaums World]] began to [[Troll (Internet)|troll]] teens' memorial pages on [[Facebook]], with the comments including expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyberbullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salazar|first=Cristian|title=Alexis Pilkington Facebook Horror: Cyber Bullies Harass Teen Even After Suicide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/alexis-pilkington-faceboo_n_512482.html|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and partnership to the 2011 film ''[[Bully (2011 film)|Bully]]'', a grassroots effort to stop cyberbullying called the Bully Project was created. Their goal is to start "a national movement to stop bullying that is transforming children's lives and changing a culture of bullying into one of empathy and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebullyproject.com/|title=The BULLY Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek science==
An early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G.

{{quote|Aristotle described at length what was involved in having scientific knowledge of something. To be scientific, he said, one must deal with causes, one must use logical demonstration, and one must identify the universals which 'inhere' in the particulars of sense. But above all, to have science one must have ''[[Apodicticity|apodictic certainty]]''. It is the last feature which, for Aristotle, most clearly distinguished the scientific way of knowing.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;|[[Larry Laudan]]|''Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis'', "The Demise of the Demarcation Problem"}}
In Charmides Plato discusses a "science of science". Although the subject in the dialogue is epistemological, it is an early version of the demarcation problem.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable secondary source.|date=August 2018}}

[[G. E. R. Lloyd]] notes that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to "legitimate their own positions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

==Logical positivism==
[[Logical positivism]], formulated in the 1920s, held that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled "[[Metaphysics#Rejections of metaphysics|metaphysics]]" (see [[the verifiability theory of meaning]] also known as [[verificationism]]). This distinction between science, which in the view of the [[Vienna Circle]] possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively called "metaphysics", which lacked such statements, can be seen as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kYUFhlIRZA4C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;dq=demarcation+%22logical+positivism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9n8U7vdEuKw7AbYgIG4DA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=demarcation%20%22logical%20positivism%22&amp;f=false Grayling, AC., ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 67-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, "The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#LogPos |at=4.1 The Logical Positivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsifiability==
[[Falsifiability]] is the demarcation criterion proposed by [[Karl Popper]] as opposed to verificationism: "statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#KarPop |at=4.2 Falsificationism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science.  Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of "meaningfulness".

{{quote|Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for excluding legitimate science… and for giving some pseudosciences the status of being scientific… According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it "has the untoward consequence of countenancing as 'scientific' every crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions". Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted… Similarly, the major threats to the scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has been tested and failed the tests.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

In Popper's later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of "the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences," so that a statement's scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable "if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued that physics only accepts theories that are sufficiently unified, this persistent preference for unity committing physics to accepting an implicit metaphysical (i.e. non-falsifiable) thesis concerning the unity of nature.  For good Popperian reasons, this implicit metaphysical thesis needs to be made explicit within physics so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved.  Popper's demarcation criterion is refuted: an unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is a basic tenet of scientific knowledge within physics, whether this is recognized or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1974) [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1348844/ The Rationality of Scientific Discovery] Philosophy of Science, 41 (2) 123-153; 1998 [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press, Oxford; 2017 [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress] Paragon House, St. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpositivism==
[[Thomas Kuhn]], an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called [[postpositivism]] or [[postempiricism]]. In his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called [[normal science]] and [[extraordinary science]] (which he sometimes also called "revolutionary science"). "In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…"&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt; That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving lies in its suggesting solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.

{{quote|Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline "particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition"… Therefore, according to Kuhn, astrology has never been a science.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

Popper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a "major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

==Feyerabend and Lakatos==
Kuhn's work largely called into question Popper's demarcation, and emphasized the human, [[subjectivity|subjective]] quality of scientific change. [[Paul Feyerabend]] was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=C.A. |last=Taylor |year=1996 |title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation |series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299150341 |lccn=96000180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both [[Imre Lakatos]] and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.

==Thagard==
[[Paul R. Thagard]] has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and believes it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html ''Why Astrology Is A Pseudoscience''], [[Paul R. Thagard]], In Philosophy of Science Association 1978 Volume 1, edited by P.D. Asquith and I. Hacking (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; and...
# The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.

Thagard specifies that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely "unpromising" before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cites astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became "pseudoscience" in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.

Thagard also states that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful [[ignorance]] of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.

==Some historians' perspectives==
Many historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge.  In the article on science in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh edition]] of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the scientist and historian [[William Cecil Dampier Whetham]] defined science as "ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dampier Whetham | first = William Cecil | author-link = William Cecil Dampier Whetham | publication-date = 1911 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution = Science | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = New York | url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his study of Greek science, [[Marshall Clagett]] defined science as "first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clagett | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall Clagett
| publication-date = 1963 | title = Greek Science in Antiquity | publisher = Collier Books | publication-place = New York | page = 4 | isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar definition appeared more recently in [[David Pingree]]'s study of early science: "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pingree | first = David | author-link = David Pingree | year = 1992 | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | journal = Isis | volume  = 83 | pages = 554–563 | doi=10.1086/356288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions tend to focus more on the subject matter of science than on its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a line of demarcation between science and non-science becomes "problematic, if not futile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | editor-last = Fountain | editor-first = John W. | editor2-last = Sinclair | editor2-first = Rolf M. | publication-date = 2005 | title = Current Studies in Archaeoastronomy: Conversations Across Time and Space | chapter = Different Astronomies, Different Cultures and the Question of Cultural Relativism | publisher = Carolina Academic Press | publication-place = Durham, NC | page = 71 | isbn = 0-89089-771-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laudan==
[[Larry Laudan]] concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that "philosophy has failed to deliver the goods" in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience.  None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his view, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else.  He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded.  He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as {{lang|fr|machines de guerre}} in polemical disputes between "scientists" and "pseudo-scientists."  Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he saw the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not.  In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by focusing on the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not.  He would consign phrases like "pseudo-science" or "unscientific" to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;

Others have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argues that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;  Rather, Laudan's reasoning at the most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lutz |first=Sebastian |title=On an Allegedly Essential Feature of Criteria for the Demarcation of Science |journal=The Reasoner |pages=125–126 |volume=5 |number=8 |year=2011 |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5(8).pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109143743/http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5%288%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences; another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. [[Massimo Pigliucci]] wrote that science generally conforms to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s concept of [[family resemblance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci, Massimo]] (2013). "The Demarcation Problem: A (Belated) Response to Laudan" in Pigliucci, Massimo; [[Maarten Boudry|Boudry, Maarten]], eds. ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'' chapter 1.  {{ISBN|978-0-226-05196-3}}. Pigliucci's chapter is available online at http://philpapers.org/rec/PIGTDP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Concerning [[science education]], Michael D. Gordin wrote:&lt;ref name=Gordin&gt;Michael D. Gordin (2015) "Myth 27. That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience", in ''Newton’s Apple and other Myths about Science'', [[Ronald L. Numbers]] editor, [[Harvard University Press]] {{doi|10.4159/9780674089167-029}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}}
:Every student in public or private takes several years of science, but only a small fraction of them pursue careers in the sciences. We teach the rest of them so much science so that they will appreciate what it ''means'' to be scientific – and, hopefully, become scientifically literate and apply some of those lessons in their lives. For such students, the myth of a bright line of demarcation is essential.
Discussions of the demarcation problem highlight the [[rhetoric of science]] and promote [[critical thinking]]. Citizens thinking critically, and expressing themselves with reasoned argument in [[public policy|policy discussion]], contribute to enlightened democracy. For example, Gordin stated
:Demarcation remains essential for the enormously high political stakes of climate-change denial and other anti-regulatory fringe doctrines.&lt;ref name=Gordin/&gt;{{rp|225}}
The demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating [[fake news]] from real news, which rose to prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=LeVine |first=Michael V |title=Science has experience fighting fake news — and Facebook should take note |url=https://mic.com/articles/161376/science-has-experience-fighting-fake-news-and-facebook-should-take-note#.m62pUua8z |year=2016 |journal=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital phobic''' is an informal phrase used to describe a reluctance to become fully immersed in the [[digital age]] for being fearful of how it might negatively change or alter everyday life.
 
The fast-paced development of the [[digital world]] in the twenty-first century has contributed to the [[digital divide]] becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of, interest in, or access to [[digital device]]s has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence.

Digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the [[social influence|social impact]] of the [[technological age]].  The phrase considers the fears associated with [[technological evolution]] and change, and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day-to-day life.

==Discourse==
Everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century, significantly impacting both those embracing [[technological change]] as well as those reluctant to be a part of it.

A sharp rise in technological innovations during the 21st century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work, socialize, and learn – all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age.  Psychologists, academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social, cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyze someone to becoming 'digital phobic'.

[[Technophobia]] is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number, and combination of, concerns.  With the oncoming of the [[digital age]], worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over [[data protection]], [[Economic security|financial security]], [[identity theft]], [[technical inability]] and [[invasion of privacy]].

There is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and, whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy, the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles among digital users.
 
Recent research from Foresters, an international financial services organization, found 2% of the UK population to fall into this category of [[internet user]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/digital-addict--or-just-checking-your-facebook-page-a-quarter-of-all-men-and-women-spend-an-unhealthy-amount-of-time-online-9506966.html Paul Gallagher.  Digital Addict – or just checking your Facebook page?  A quarter of all men and women spend an 'unhealthy amount of time online'.  The Independent.  8 June 2014.  Accessed: 27 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;   A further breakdown of this statistic, sees the percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase, with 4% fearful of [[online shopping]] for worrying that someone will steal their card details, and 12% fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details.

When asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey, a larger percentage of the UK population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things. 31% believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly, while 32% thought advances in technology will result in long-held [[loss of tradition|traditions being lost]].

This fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data-holding, services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm, and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases.  Worrying levels of time spent on devices, the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or [[data abuse|abuse]] of [[personal data]] entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia among a proportion of the population.

Concerns about the negative, exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms. April 2014 research conducted by [[Pew Research Center]], in association with [[Smithsonian Magazine]], revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half-century.  30% of Americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Smith|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/04/17/us-views-of-technology-and-the-future/|title=Future of Technology - Pew Research Center|date=17 April 2014|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered amid reports of dis-interest in the internet among Japan's residents despite its reputation as a high-tech nation, these reports contribute towards a growing understanding that high-tech advancements are not universally celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10543126.  Michael Fitzpatrick.  Revealing Japan's Low Tech Belly.  BBC News.  13 July 2010.  Accessed: 20 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the May 2014 "[[right to be forgotten]]" ruling put in place in the European Union which allows internet users to request for their internet history to be un-searchable if deemed incorrect, outdated or irrelevant, and the thousands of requests received in the first few days following its announcement documents a, perhaps previously hidden, widespread fear of leaving a digital footprint and/or being falsely represented online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|author=Charles Arthur|title=Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|journal=The Guardian|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Digital phobia is part of a wider societal conversation on how we relate to, trust in, and interact with technology and considers the potentially negative implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world. 
 
This phrase has been developed by Foresters, the international financial services organisation, for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology among the UK population.

Developed within a digital vocabulary consisting of four other phrases ([[digital addict]], [[digital omnivore]], digital agnostic, digital denier), digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behavior within the digital age.

The phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the 21st century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline.  Research conducted by Foresters in association with Tech Timeout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techtimeout.com/|title=Tech Timeout|work=Tech Timeout|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society, formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over 1,000 UK respondents. 
 
Both anecdotal and research-based evidence suggests categories of internet use, whilst they cannot be linearly divided, are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society.  The developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and contextualize how new and existing technology is viewed and have been cited in international [[online newspaper]]s and [[blog post]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=11270004.|title=Digital addict - spending an 'unhealthy' amount of time online|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=June 8, 2014|accessdate=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst this phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on UK technology-users, the phrase is not UK-specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics.

==Social and cultural impact==
Digital phobia presents a real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become a central and essential resource.  [[Internet culture]] has developed to become a part of the fabric of [[everyday life]] and is now even considered part of the make-up of [[national identity]] with a country's internet use and [[digital footprint]] an important modern index for international comparison, often associated with development and [[modernity]].

The consequences of [[non-participation]] in the digital world are far reaching, and can affect the economic, cultural, social, occupational and educational life of a non-user.  For example, in 2009 [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]] estimated that UK households offline are missing out on savings of £560 a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |format=PDF |work=Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP. |title=Champion for Digital Inclusion: The Economic Case for Digital Inclusion |date=October 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329114456/http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States older people without internet access or the skills to make the most of it are considered a disadvantaged proportion of the population as, amongst other important resources, vital healthcare information and initiatives conducted online are unavailable to those not a part of the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaitlin |last=Roberts|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/262309/how-the-digital-divide-hurts-the-elderly-in-times-of-crisis|title=How the digital divide hurts the elderly in times of crisis|work=theweek.com|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heightened fears of how technology may be affecting the human population stems from a, for some very logical, fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so.  With such a significance placed on [[online participation]], concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stay away from the internet, avoid certain activities online, or use the internet without enthusiasm and only as necessitated.

A survey conducted by security firm [[Avira]] identified 84% of people fear [[social networking site]]s will steal or misuse their personal information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Liebowitz|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47264062/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/people-fear-social-media/%20-%20.U5rM8yxOXL8#.U6rR8SxOXL8|title=84% of People Fear Social Media|work=msnbc.com|date= February 5, 2012|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the net majority of internet users share, at least partially, in distrusting the digital world. Whilst many will, despite this fear, adopt cautious optimism and still use social networking as part of their everyday lives this high percentage serves to demonstrate that a fear significant enough for some to avoid readily using online and [[digital service]]s is a fear shared by a large number of internet users.

Whilst some digital phobics have preferred to remain distanced from technology due to hypothetical concerns others have attempted to join in societal interest but find themselves unable to stay caught up with new technology or would like to see its progression halted as evolution of the [[digital world]] has reached new speeds. The 2013 [[Oxford Internet Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |format=PDF |first1=William H. |last1=Dutton |first2=Grant |last2=Blank |title=Cultures of the Internet: The Internet in Britain |work=The Oxford Internet Survey 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602045751/http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes this concern among UK users, identifying distinct categories of both non-users and ex-users of internet-based technology who, for a variety of reasons, have discontinued or refuse to access the online world.  This is further supported by results from a 2013 survey of internet use in America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathryn |last=Zickuhr|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who's Not Online and Why|date=25 September 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found 32% of non-internet users avoiding the online world because of finding the internet difficult or frustrating to use, being physically unable or worried about other issues such as viruses, threat of hacking or spam – a figure considerably higher than in earlier years.

Concern over the presence of a [[digital divide]], whether locally or globally, is only exacerbated by the knowledge that access to many government and council services, [[job application]]s, and social and cultural resources are now largely internet based. [[Internet access]] has become a hurdle in contemporary society which, for those without the necessary desire to learn or knowledge of internet-based systems, can be difficult to navigate around, often resulting in key services and vital resources being less easily accessible, leaving non-users feeling isolated.  Private and government campaigns to tackle this issue further demonstrate the severity and long-lasting impact of having a proportion of the population disinclined or disinterested in going online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jenny |last=Hirschkon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/finance/your-bank/10890366/elderly-help-internet.html|title=Connecting the elderly with internet know-how|date=June 12, 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy |last=Settle|url=https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/14/digital-inclusion-strategy-launches-today/|title=Digital Inclusion Strategy launches today|work=blog.gov.uk|date=April 14, 2014| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the online world becomes saturated, device options for connecting to the internet vary and news of technological inventions goes [[viral marketing|viral]] the [[exponential growth]] of the technological world is only contributing towards a growing number of 'digital phobic' tech-users amongst the [[global population]].

== Education ==
Digital phobia has had a negative impact on the field of education. Some teachers have expressed a fear that new and advanced technology is supplanting them as the masters of their fields of study and a study of teachers in Wilmington, Delaware has shown that educators in this area are acclimating to the new technology in their classrooms at a slower pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local researchers believe that there are many factors why that is the case and some of the things they have found are things such as a lack of technological education by the teachers, and also the lack of time, or incentive to adjust to the new technology. University Larry Cuban has stated that "The introduction of computers into school was supposed to improve academic achievement , and alter how teachers taught. Neither has occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant infusion of new technology has many teachers fearing that they are losing their classroom. This new technology is essentially diminishing the role of a teacher in the classroom.

Researchers believe that educators are slow to adapt to technology because they aren't given time to acclimate to the new technology, causing them to hesitate to use it in the classroom and express fear that these technologies may interfere with genuine learning particularly in humanities and creative subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/sep/13/schools.news1|title=Report reveals teachers' fear of classroom technology|last=Curtis|first=Polly|date=2005-09-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-06|last2=correspondent|first2=education|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''New Media Reader,'' Theodor H. Nelson wrote that people are opposed to the computer because they believe it is "cold" and "inhuman", but a human can be just as inhuman and maybe even more so than the actual machine itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50096832|title=The NewMediaReader|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|others=Wardrip-Fruin, Noah., Montfort, Nick.|isbn=9780262232272|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50096832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3090">'''Douglas Gary Speck''' (October 16, 1947 - March 4, 2010) was a high school teacher and [[track and field]] enthusiast.  He carried his love of the sport into becoming a major promoter and source of information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=140657198#sthash.lzuV0ELt.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1968, he joined Doug Smith in the creation of the [[Arcadia Invitational]].  Speck oversaw the growth of the meet, from a local spectacle to the premiere in-season nationwide invitational now called the "Home of national records."

{{quote|He was an innovator. He was thinking of things before others. He really helped in the explosion of our sport.|Rich Gonzalez&lt;ref name=Pasadena&gt;http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/sports/20100306/high-schools-former-track-coach-speck-62-dies&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From his office at [[Arcadia High School (Arcadia, California)|Arcadia High School]], Speck became the ultimate researcher of the best track athletes around the United States.  In order to attract the best athletes to the Invitational, he had to know who they were, so Speck tracked performances and statistics, writing columns for running publications like California Track and Running News.  In the infancy of the internet, he joined Gonzalez in starting a website providing the most in depth coverage of high school track and field athletes in California.  Merging with John Dye's similar site in North Carolina, they created the nationwide [[Dyestat]] site self-described as "The Internet Home of High School Track &amp; Field."  The California version was known as Dyestatcal.&lt;ref name=Pasadena /&gt;

Speck's fountain of information was not limited to print.  He was the P.A. announcer at many of the top high school track and field meets including the [[Los Angeles Invitational|Sunkist Invitational]], the [[National Scholastic Indoor Championships]], the [[Foot Locker Cross Country Championships]], the Junior [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|National Championships]] and the series of championship meets that led to the [[CIF California State Meet]].  He worked on the advisory committees for the State Championships for both track and field and [[cross country running|cross country]].&lt;ref&gt;http://theconningtower.blogspot.com/2010/03/high-school-track-enthusiast-doug-speck.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested the enthusiasm he instilled in the crowd encouraged many [[United States high school national records in track and field|national records]] to happen.

Following his untimely death to [[brain cancer]], the National Scholastic Athletics Foundation created an annual award "The Doug Speck Award for Excellence &amp; Innovation."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalscholastic.org/article/744/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European cuisine''', or alternatively '''Western cuisine''', is a generalised term collectively referring to the [[cuisine]]s of [[Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Culinary Cultures of Europe: Identity, Diversity and Dialogue|publisher=Council of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Western world|Western countries]],&lt;ref name="europeword"&gt;[http://www.europeword.com/blog/europe/european-cuisine/  "European Cuisine."] [http://www.europeword.com Europeword.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including (depending on the definition) that of [[Russia]],&lt;ref name="europeword"/&gt; as well as non-[[Indigenous people|indigenous]] cuisines of [[Australasia]], the [[Americas]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[Oceania]], which derive substantial influence from European settlers in those regions. The term is used by [[East Asia]]ns to contrast with Asian styles of cooking.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;Leung Man-tao (12 February 2007), "Eating and Cultural Stereotypes", ''Eat and Travel Weekly'', no. 312, p. 76. Hong Kong|publisher=Next Media Limited&lt;/ref&gt; (This is analogous to Westerners' referring collectively to the cuisines of East Asian countries as [[Asian cuisine]].) When used by Westerners, the term may sometimes refer more specifically to cuisine ''in'' Europe; in this context, a synonym is '''[[Continental Europe|Continental]] cuisine''', especially in [[British English]].

The cuisines of Western countries are diverse by themselves, although there are common characteristics that distinguish Western cooking from cuisines of Asian countries&lt;ref name="Kwan 1988"&gt;Kwan Shuk-yan (1988). ''Selected Occidental Cookeries and Delicacies'', p. 23. Hong Kong: Food Paradise Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving-size.&lt;ref name="Lin 1977"&gt;Lin Ch'ing (1977). ''First Steps to European Cooking'', p. 5. Hong Kong: Wan Li Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steak]] and [[cutlet]] in particular are common dishes across the West. Western cuisines also put substantial emphasis on [[grape wine]] and on sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments (in part due to the difficulty of seasonings penetrating the often larger pieces of meat used in Western cooking). Many dairy products are utilised in the cooking process, except in [[nouvelle cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Kwan Shuk-yan, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheese]]s are produced in hundreds of different varieties, and [[fermented milk products]] are also available in a wide selection. [[Wheat]]-flour bread has long been the most common source of [[starch]] in this cuisine, along with [[pasta]], [[dumpling]]s and [[Pastry|pastries]], although the [[potato]] has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the [[European colonisation of the Americas]], particularly in Northern Europe. [[Maize]] is much less common in most European diets than it is in the [[Americas]]; however corn meal ([[polenta]] or [[mămăligă]]), is a major part of the cuisine of [[Italy]] and the [[Balkans]]. Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as [[pizza]] or [[tarte flambée]]), and rice are eaten in Europe, they do not constitute an ever-present staple.  [[Salad]]s (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables with sauce) are an integral part of European cuisine.

Formal European dinners are served in distinct courses. European presentation evolved from [[service à la française]], or bringing multiple dishes to the table at once, into [[service à la russe]], where dishes are presented sequentially. Usually, cold, hot and savoury, and sweet dishes are served strictly separately in this order, as [[hors d'oeuvre]] (appetizer) or soup, as [[entrée]] and [[main course]], and as [[dessert]]. Dishes that are both sweet and savoury were common earlier in ancient Roman cuisine, but are today uncommon, with sweet dishes being served only as dessert. A service where the guests are free to take food by themselves is termed a [[buffet]], and is usually restricted to parties or holidays. Nevertheless, guests are expected to follow the same pattern.

Historically, European cuisine has been developed in the European royal and noble courts. European nobility was usually arms-bearing and lived in separate manors in the countryside. The knife was the primary eating implement ([[cutlery]]), and eating steaks and other foods that require cutting followed. In contrast in the Sinosphere, the ruling class were the court officials, who had their food cut ready to eat in the kitchen, to be eaten with chopsticks. The knife was supplanted by the [[spoon]] for soups, while the [[fork]] was introduced later in the [[early modern period]], ca. 16th century. Today, most dishes are intended to be eaten with cutlery and only a few [[finger food]]s can be eaten with the hands in polite company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3260">'''''Exploring Reality: The Intertwining of Science &amp; Religion''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] which offers a "progress report" on his "search for truth. All my life I have been trying to explore reality.  That exploration includes science, but it also necessarily takes me beyond it.  The process of investigation has a spiral character, as tackling the issues draws the explorer inwards towards a deeper engagement with the multidimensional character of reality"&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Reality'' pp(ix-x)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication Information==
The book is published by [[SPCK]] in the UK and by [[Yale University Press]] in the USA, in 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-11014-6}}

==Synopsis==
In '''1. Reality''' Polkinghorne explains "how natural the task of exploring reality is for someone whose intellectual formation has been in the sciences"(p xi) and asserts his belief in [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|Critical realism]] against [[Postmodernism]].

'''2. The Causal Nexus of the World''' suggests that "scientifically our knowledge is still pretty patchy, excellent within certain well-defined domains but often unable to make satisfactory connections between different domains. The problematic of the relationship of [[Quantum physics]] to [[Classical physics]] provides an instructive example" and also that "matters of [[causality]] ... are not finally settled by science alone. Ultimate conclusions have to rest on the foundation of a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] decision."(p xii)

In '''3. Human Nature''' he notes that [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Frederick Temple]] welcomed [[Charles Darwin]]'s insights, which also implied a level of continuity between humans and other animals. However he notes that humans abilities in language, science and rationality are very different from those of animals.&lt;ref&gt;pp 41-43&lt;/ref&gt; He says "the fact that we share 98.4% of our DNA with chimpanzees shows the fallacy of genetic reductionism, rather than proving that we are only apes who are slightly different.  After all I share 99.9% of my DNA with [[J. S. Bach]], but that fact carries no implication of a close correspondence between our musical abilities"(p45). He suggests that "while [[natural selection]] has been an important factor in the development of life on Earth, it is by no means obvious that it is the only type of process involved" and that "the attempt to force classical Darwinian thinking into the role of an explanatory principle of almost universal scope has proved singularly unconvincing as it seeks to inflate an assembly of half-truths into a theory of everything".&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.. pp50-51. He mentions in particular [[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that Evolutionary epistemology is also based on a half-truth. Being able to make sense of everyday experience is a vital asset, yet when [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] discovered universal gravity, something happened that went far beyond anything needed for survival and that rational feats like proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] go far beyond anything susceptible to Darwinian explanation.&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' p51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from [[Taoist]] traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.

Falun Gong was first taught publicly in Northeast China in 1992 by [[Li Hongzhi]]. It emerged toward the end of China's "''qigong'' boom"—a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing. It differs from other ''qigong'' schools in its absence of fees or formal membership, lack of daily rituals of worship, its greater emphasis on morality, and the theological nature of its teachings. Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline, a "spiritual movement", a "cultivation system" in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, or as a form of Chinese [[religion]].

The practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese officialdom, but by the mid to late 1990s, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] and public security organizations increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size, independence from the state, and spiritual teachings. By 1999, government estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million.&lt;ref name=Faison/&gt; During that time, negative coverage of Falun Gong began to appear in the state-run press, and practitioners usually responded by picketing the source involved. Most of the time, the practitioners succeeded, but controversy and tension continued to build. The scale of protests grew until April 1999, when over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered near the central government compound in Beijing to request legal recognition and freedom from state interference. This demonstration is widely seen as catalyzing the persecution that followed.

On 20 July 1999, the Communist Party leadership initiated a nationwide [[Persecution of Falun Gong|crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign]] intended to eradicate the practice. It [[Persecution of Falun Gong#Internet censorship|blocked]] Internet access to websites that mention Falun Gong, and in October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a "heretical organization" that threatened social stability. Falun Gong practitioners in China are reportedly subject to a wide range of [[human rights]] abuses: hundreds of thousands are estimated to have been imprisoned extrajudicially,&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House, [https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/12222014_FH_ChinaReport2014_FINAL.pdf The Politburo's Predicament: Confronting the Limitations of Communist Party Repression] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417122423/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/12222014_FH_ChinaReport2014_FINAL.pdf# |date=17 April 2016 }}, January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and practitioners in detention are subject to forced labor, [[Political abuse of psychiatry|psychiatric abuse]], torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities.&lt;ref name=CER/&gt; As of 2009, human rights groups estimated that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had died as a result of abuse in custody.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Andrew Jacobs.

==Origins==
Falun Gong is most frequently identified with the [[qigong]] movement in China. ''Qigong'' is a modern term that refers to a variety of practices involving slow movement, meditation, and regulated breathing. Qigong-like exercises have historically been practiced by Buddhist monks, Daoist martial artists, and Confucian scholars as a means of spiritual, moral, and physical refinement.

The modern qigong movement emerged in the early 1950s, when Communist [[cadres]] embraced the techniques as a way to improve health.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite book|author=David Palmer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXeuibmD2dsC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=Qigong%20fever%3A%20body%2C%20science%2C%20and%20utopia%20in%20China%E2%80%8E%20-%20Page%20241&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=|title=Qigong Fever: Body, Science and Utopia in China|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-231-14066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new term was constructed to avoid association with religious practices, which were prone to being labeled as "feudal superstition" and persecuted during the [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] era.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby2000&gt;David Ownby, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~tnchina/commentary/ownby1000.html "Falungong as a Cultural Revitalization Movement: An Historian Looks at Contemporary China"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604220357/http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~tnchina/commentary/ownby1000.html# |date=4 June 2011 }}, Talk Given at Rice University, 20 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Early adopters of qigong eschewed its religious overtones and regarded qigong principally as a branch of Chinese medicine.

On 13 May 1992, Li Hongzhi gave his first public seminar on Falun Gong (alternatively called Falun Dafa) in the northeastern city of [[Changchun]]. In his [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] spiritual biography, Li Hongzhi is said to have been taught ways of "cultivation practice" by several masters of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism|Daoist]] traditions, including Quan Jue, the 10th Heir to the Great Law of the Buddha School, and a master of the Great Way School with the Taoist alias of ''True Taoist'' from the [[Changbai Mountains]]. Falun Dafa is said to be the result of his reorganizing and writing down the teachings that were passed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://media.falundafa.org/media1/media/dafa/eng/mp3/En-1-Lecture.mp3 9-day Lectures in Guangzhou (audio), lecture 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113060130/http://media.falundafa.org/media1/media/dafa/eng/mp3/En-1-Lecture.mp3# |date=13 November 2017 }}, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Li presented Falun Gong as part of a "centuries-old tradition of cultivation",&lt;ref name=Ownbyming&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ownby|first1=David|title=A History for Falun Gong: Popular Religion and the Chinese State Since the Ming Dynasty|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/a-history-for-falun-gong-popular.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205431/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/a-history-for-falun-gong-popular.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in effect sought to revive the religious and spiritual elements of qigong practice that had been discarded in the earlier Communist era. David Palmer writes that Li "redefined his method as having entirely different objectives from qigong: the purpose of practice should neither be physical health nor the development of extraordinary powers, but to purify one's heart and attain spiritual salvation."&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Falun Gong is distinct from other qigong schools in that its teachings cover a wide range of spiritual and metaphysical topics, placing emphasis on morality and virtue and elaborating a complete cosmology.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; The practice identifies with the Buddhist School (''Fojia'') but also draws on concepts and language found in Taoism and Confucianism.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; This has led some scholars to label the practice as a [[syncretism|syncretic]] faith.&lt;ref name=irons2003/&gt;

===Central teachings===
[[File:Falun Gong Meditation in Manhattan New York.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Falun Gong adherents practice the fifth exercise, a meditation, in Manhattan]]
Falun Gong aspires to enable the practitioner to ascend spiritually through moral rectitude and the practice of a set of exercises and meditation. The three central tenets of the belief are Truthfulness (真, Zhēn), Compassion (善, Shàn), and Forbearance (忍, Rěn).&lt;ref name=zflprinciples&gt;Li Hongzhi, Zhuan Falun, p 7. Quote: "The most fundamental characteristic of this universe, Zhen-Shan-Ren, is the highest manifestation of the Buddha Fa. It is the most fundamental Buddha Fa."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bwqkwx4SWS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ownby+falun&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong and the Future of China],'' pp 93, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criteria for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestations of the [[Tao]], or Buddhist Dharma.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, p 29. Quote: "According to the Falun Gong belief system, there are three virtues that are also principles of the universe: Zhen, Shan, and Ren (真, 善, 忍). Zhen is truthfulness and sincerity. Shan is compassion, benevolence, and kindness. Ren is forbearance, tolerance, and endurance. These three virtues are the only criteria that truly distinguish good people and bad people. Human society has deviated from these moral standards. All matter in the universe contains Zhen- Shan-Ren. All three are equally important."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China, p 93. Quote: "The very structure of the universe, according to Li Hongzhi, is made up of the moral qualities that cultivators are enjoined to practice in their own lives: truth, compassion, and forbearance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 133. Quote: "For Li, as he often repeats in Zhuan Falun, the special characteristic or particular nature of the cosmos is the moral triumvirate of zhen (truth), shan (compassion), and ren (forbearance). He does not mean this metaphorically; for him zhen, shan, and ren are the basic organizing principles of all things&amp;nbsp;... it is embedded in the very essence of everything in the universe that they adhere to the principles of truth, compassion, and forbearance."&lt;/ref&gt; Adherence to and cultivation of these virtues is regarded as a fundamental part of Falun Gong practice.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 124. Quote: "In addition, in Falun Gong cultivation adherence to the code of truth, compassion, and forbearance is not just regarded as the right and responsible course of action for practitioners; it is an essential part of the cultivation process. Lapsing from it will render any other efforts in cultivation worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; In Zhuan Falun (转法轮), the foundational text published in 1995, Li Hongzhi writes "It doesn't matter how mankind's moral standard changes&amp;nbsp;... The nature of the cosmos doesn't change, and it is the only standard for determining who's good and who's bad. So to be a cultivator you have to take the nature of the cosmos as your guide for improving yourself."&lt;ref name=ZF&gt;Li Hongzhi, ''[http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/lecture1.html Zhuan Falun] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020917213525/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/lecture1.html |date=17 September 2002 }}, (New York, NY: The Universe Publishing Company, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice of Falun Gong consists of two features: performance of the exercises, and the refinement of one's ''xinxing'' (moral character, temperament). In Falun Gong's central text, Li states that xinxing "includes virtue (which is a type of matter), it includes forbearance, it includes awakening to things, it includes giving up things—giving up all the desires and all the attachments that are found in an ordinary person—and you also have to endure hardship, to name just a few things."&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevation of one's moral character is achieved, on the one hand, by aligning one's life with truth, compassion, and tolerance; and on the other, by abandoning desires and "negative thoughts and behaviors, such as greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc."&lt;ref name="Benjamin Penny p 170"&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the central concepts found in the teachings of Falun Gong is the existence of 'Virtue' ('德, ''[[De (Chinese)|Dé]]'') and 'Karma' ('業, ''[[Karma#In Falun Gong|Yè]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, The Religion of Falun Gong, p 172. Quote: "Transforming karma into virtue is fundamental in the cultivation practice of Falun Gong"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby110&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp&amp;nbsp;110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is generated through doing good deeds and suffering, while the latter is accumulated through doing wrong deeds. A person's ratio of karma to virtue is said to determine his or her fortunes in this life or the next. While virtue engenders good fortune and enables spiritual transformation, an accumulation of karma results in suffering, illness, and alienation from the nature of the universe.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, "Zhuan Falun," pp&amp;nbsp;27–35; 362 - 365&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual elevation is achieved through the elimination of negative karma and the accumulation of virtue.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 93. Quote: "The goal of cultivation, and hence of life itself, is spiritual elevation, achieved through eliminating negative karma—the built-up sins of past and present lives—and accumulating virtue."&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners believe that through a process of moral cultivation, one can achieve [[Tao]] and obtain special powers and a level of divinity.&lt;ref name=penny&gt;Penny (2012), p. 158; 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeint"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dowell |first1=William |title=Interview with Li Hongzhi |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053761,00.html |publisher=TIME |accessdate=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001083402/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053761,00.html# |archive-date=1 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong's teachings posit that human beings are originally and innately good—even divine—but that they descended into a realm of delusion and suffering after developing selfishness and accruing karma.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp&amp;nbsp;103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice holds that [[reincarnation]] exists and that different people's reincarnation processes are overseen by different gods. &lt;ref name="ttfatc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990626L.html |title=Teaching the Fa at the Conference in the Midwest-U.S. |last=Li |first=Hongzhi |access-date=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130051007/http://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990626L.html# |archive-date=30 November 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To re-ascend and return to the "original, true self," Falun Gong practitioners are supposed to assimilate themselves to the qualities of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, let go of "attachments and desires" and suffer to repay karma.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 93. Quote: "One finds few lists of do's and don'ts in Li's writings, nor are there sophisticated ethical discussions. Instead, followers are advised to rid themselves of unnecessary "attachments", to do what they know is right, and hence to return to "the origin", to their "original self".&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the practice is enlightenment or spiritual perfection (''yuanman''), and release from the cycle of reincarnation, known in Buddhist tradition as ''samsara''.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Chinese cultural thought and modernity are two focuses of Li Hongzhi's teachings. Falun Gong echoes traditional Chinese beliefs that humans are connected to the universe through mind and body, and Li seeks to challenge "conventional mentalities", concerning the nature and genesis of the universe, time-space, and the human body.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v20J18hL1MAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Danny+Schechter,+Falun+Gong%27s+Challenge+to+China&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice of 'Evil Cult'?], (New York, NY:[[Akashic Books]], 2000).

===Exercises===
[[File:Five Exercises of Falun Dafa.jpg|thumb|right|The five exercises of Falun Gong]]
In addition to its moral philosophy, Falun Gong consists of four standing exercises and one sitting meditation. The exercises are regarded as secondary to moral elevation, though is still an essential component of Falun Gong cultivation practice.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=flgbook&gt;Li Hongzhi, ''[http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg.htm Falun Gong] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020913132538/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg.htm |date=13 September 2002 }}'', 4th Translation Edition, Updated April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exercises, called "Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms", are intended to facilitate the free flow of energy through the body and open up the meridians. The second exercise, "Falun Standing Stance", involves holding four static poses—each of which resembles holding a wheel—for an extended period. The objective of this exercise is to "enhances wisdom, increases strength, raises a person's level, and strengthens divine powers". The third, "Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes", involves three sets of movements, which aim to enable the expulsion of bad energy (e.g., pathogenic or black qi) and the absorption of good energy into the body. Through practice of this exercise, the practitioner aspires to cleanse and purify the body. The fourth exercise, "Falun Cosmic Orbit", seeks to circulate energy freely throughout the body. Unlike the first through fourth exercises, the fifth exercise is performed in the seated lotus position. Called "Reinforcing Supernatural Powers", it is a meditation intended to be maintained as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, Falun Gong (6th Translation Edition, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp&amp;nbsp;163–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong exercises can be practiced individually or in group settings, and can be performed for varying lengths of time in accordance with the needs and abilities of the individual practitioner.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ownby313"/&gt; Porter writes that practitioners of Falun Gong are encouraged to read Falun Gong books and practice its exercises on a regular basis, preferably daily.&lt;ref name=porterthesis&gt;Noah Porter, "[http://etd.fcla.edu/SF/SFE0000113/FalunGongInTheUS-NoahPorter-Thesis.pdf Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study]". University of South Florida, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong exercises are practiced in group settings in parks, university campuses, and other public spaces in over 70 countries worldwide, and are taught for free by volunteers.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html 'Find your local volunteer contact person'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118225305/http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html |date=18 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to five exercises, in 2001 another meditation activity was introduced called "sending righteous thoughts," which is intended to reduce persecution on the spiritual plane.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

A pilot study involving genomic profiling of six Falun Dafa practitioners indicated that, "changes in gene expression of [Falun Gong] practitioners in contrast to normal healthy controls were characterized by enhanced immunity, downregulation of cellular metabolism, and alteration of apoptotic genes in favor of a rapid resolution of inflammation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lili_Feng/publication/7984577_Genomic_profiling_of_neutrophil_transcripts_in_Asian_Qigong_practitioners_a_pilot_study_in_gene_regulation_by_mind-body_interaction/file/d912f50cfe3badd217.pdf Genomic profiling of neutrophil transcripts in Asian Qigong practitioners]: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750361 a pilot study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923100618/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750361# |date=23 September 2017 }} in gene regulation by mind-body interaction.

In addition to the attainment of physical health, many Buddhist and Daoist meditation systems aspire to transform the physical body and cultivate a variety of supernatural capabilities (''shentong''), such as [[telepathy]] and divine sight.&lt;ref&gt;Penny (2012), p. 157-158; 202&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of supernatural skills also feature prominently within the qigong movement, and the existence of these skills gained a level mainstream acceptance in China’s scientific community in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;  Falun Gong’s teachings hold that practitioners can acquire supernatural skills through a combination of moral cultivation, meditation and exercises. These include—but are not limited to—precognition, clairaudience, telepathy, and divine sight (via the opening of the [[third eye]] or celestial eye). However, Falun Gong stresses that these powers can be developed only as a result of moral practice, and should not be pursued or casually displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Penny (2012), p. 158; 201&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Ownby, Falun Gong teaches that “Pride in one's abilities, or the desire to show off, are marks of dangerous attachments,” and Li warns his followers not to be distracted by the pursuit of such powers.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

===Social practices===
[[File:Toronto Falun Gong Exercises 9.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Falun Gong adherents practice the third exercise in Toronto.]]Falun Gong differentiates itself from Buddhist monastic traditions in that it places great importance on participation in the secular world. Falun Gong practitioners are required to maintain regular jobs and family lives, to observe the laws of their respective governments, and are instructed not to distance themselves from society. An exception is made for Buddhist monks and nuns, who are permitted to continue a monastic lifestyle while practicing Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, p 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its emphasis on ethical behavior, Falun Gong's teachings prescribe a strict personal morality for practitioners. They are expected to act truthfully, do good deeds, and conduct themselves with patience and forbearance when encountering difficulties. For instance, Li stipulates that a practitioner of Falun Gong must "not hit back when attacked, not talk back when insulted."&lt;ref name=Penny102/&gt; In addition, they must "abandon negative thoughts and behaviors," such as greed, deception, jealousy, etc.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Penny102&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp 102; 170-181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The teachings contain injunctions against smoking and the consumption of alcohol, as these are considered addictions that are detrimental to health and mental clarity.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby112/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Falun Gong are forbidden to kill living things—including animals for the purpose of obtaining food—though they are not required to adopt a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=Penny102/&gt;

In addition to these things, practitioners of Falun Gong must abandon a variety of worldly attachments and desires.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Penny p 170"/&gt; In the course of cultivation practice, the student of Falun Gong aims to relinquish the pursuit of fame, monetary gain, sentimentality, and other entanglements. Li's teachings repeatedly emphasize the emptiness of material pursuits; although practitioners of Falun Gong are not encouraged to leave their jobs or eschew money, they are expected to give up the psychological attachments to these things.&lt;ref name=Ownby112/&gt; Similarly, sexual desire and lust are treated as attachments to be discarded, but Falun Gong students are still generally expected to marry and have families.&lt;ref name=Ownby112&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp&amp;nbsp;112–114.&lt;/ref&gt; All sexual relations outside the confines of monogamous, heterosexual marriage are regarded as immoral.&lt;ref name=wildgrass/&gt; Although gays and lesbians may practice Falun Gong, homosexual conduct is said to generate karma, and is therefore viewed as incompatible with the goals of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 Misconceptions: "Intolerant"?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612214442/http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23# |date=12 June 2010 }}, 16 June 2008.

Falun Gong's cosmology includes the belief that different ethnicities each have a correspondence to their own heavens, and that individuals of mixed race lose some aspect of this connection.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Nonetheless, Li maintains that being of mixed race does not affect a person's soul, nor hinder their ability to practice cultivation.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The practice does not have any formal stance against interracial marriage, and many Falun Gong practitioners have interracial children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 |title=FalunInfo.net - Misconceptions: 'Intolerant'? |work=faluninfo.net |year=2011 |quote=practice |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong doctrine counsels against participation in political or social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive interest in politics is viewed as an attachment to worldly power and influence, and Falun Gong aims for transcendence of such pursuits. According to Hu Ping, "Falun Gong deals only with purifying the individual through exercise, and does not touch on social or national concerns. It has not suggested or even intimated a model for social change. Many religions&amp;nbsp;... pursue social reform to some extent&amp;nbsp;... but there is no such tendency evident in Falun Gong."&lt;ref name=Ping&gt;Hu Ping, "The Falun Gong Phenomenon", in Challenging China: Struggle and Hope in an Era of Change, Sharon Hom and Stacy Mosher (ed) (New York: The New Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texts===
The first book of Falun Gong teachings was published in April 1993. Called ''China Falun Gong'', or simply ''Falun Gong'', it is an introductory text that discusses ''qigong'', Falun Gong's relationship to Buddhism, the principles of cultivation practice and the improvement of moral character (xinxing). The book also provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises and meditation.&lt;ref name=flgbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp&amp;nbsp;93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of teachings is articulated in the book ''Zhuan Falun'', published in Chinese in January 1995. The book is divided into nine "lectures", and was based on edited transcriptions of the talks Li gave throughout China in the preceding three years.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong texts have since been translated into an additional 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;falunfafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org List of languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129120831/http://www.falundafa.org/# |date=29 November 2016 }}, Accessed 11-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these central texts, Li has published several books, lectures, articles, books of poetry, which are made available on Falun Gong websites.&lt;ref&gt;See Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html "books"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623070050/http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html# |date=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp&amp;nbsp;100–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falun Gong teachings use numerous untranslated Chinese religious and philosophical terms, and make frequent allusion to characters and incidents in Chinese folk literature and concepts drawn from [[Chinese popular religion]]. This, coupled with the literal translation style of the texts, which imitate the colloquial style of Li's speeches, can make Falun Gong scriptures difficult to approach for Westerners.&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Scott|title=Chinese and International Contexts for the Rise of Falun Gong|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/chinese-and-international-contexts-for.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205404/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/chinese-and-international-contexts-for.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
The main symbol of the practice is the ''Falun'' (Dharma wheel, or ''[[Dharmacakra]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]). In Buddhism, the Dharmacakra represents the completeness of the doctrine. To "turn the wheel of dharma" (''Zhuan Falun'') means to preach the Buddhist doctrine, and is the title of Falun Gong's main text.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "Falun Gong, Buddhism, and Buddhist qigong," Asian Studies Review 29 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the invocation of Buddhist language and symbols, the law wheel as understood in Falun Gong has distinct connotations, and is held to represent the universe.&lt;ref name=Bruseker/&gt; It is conceptualized by an emblem consisting of one large and four small (counter-clockwise) [[Swastika]] symbols, representing the Buddha, and four small [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] (yin-yang) symbols of the Daoist tradition.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruseker&gt;George Bruseker, "Falun Gong: A Modern Chinese Folk Buddhist Movement in Crisis," 26 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma-ending period===
Li situates his teaching of Falun Gong amidst the "Dharma-ending period" (''Mo Fa'', 末法), described in Buddhist scriptures as an age of moral decline when the teachings of Buddhism would need to be rectified.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The current era is described in Falun Gong's teachings as the "Fa rectification" period (''zhengfa'', which might also be translated as "to correct the dharma"), a time of cosmic transition and renewal.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The process of Fa rectification is necessitated by the moral decline and degeneration of life in the universe, and in the post-1999 context, the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government has come to be viewed as a tangible symptom of this moral decay.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; Through the process of the Fa rectification, life will be reordered according to the moral and spiritual quality of each, with good people being saved and ascending to higher spiritual planes, and bad ones being eliminated or cast down.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; In this paradigm, Li assumes the role of rectifying the Dharma by disseminating through his moral teachings.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

Some scholars, such as Maria Hsia Chang and Susan Palmer, have described Li's rhetoric about the "Fa rectification" and providing salvation "in the final period of the Last Havoc", as apocalyptic.&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; However, Benjamin Penny argues that Li's teachings are better understood in the context of a "Buddhist notion of the cycle of the Dharma or the Buddhist law".&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;Chris Bullock, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/falun-gong-cult-or-culture/3481242 ''Falun Gong: Cult or Culture?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510192427/http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/falun-gong-cult-or-culture/3481242# |date=10 May 2013 }}, National Radio. Retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gunde notes that unlike apocalyptic groups in the West, Falun Gong does not fixate on death or the end of the world, and instead "has a simple, innocuous ethical message".&lt;ref name=Gunde/&gt; Li Hongzhi does not discuss a "time of reckoning",&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; and has rejected predictions of an impending apocalypse in his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, "Falun Gong's Challenge to China, p 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization==
Falun Gong is a multifaceted discipline that means different things to different people, ranging from a set of physical exercises for the attainment of better health and a praxis of self-transformation, to a [[moral philosophy]] and a new knowledge system.&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; Scholars and journalists have adopted a variety of terms and classifications in describing Falun Gong, some of them more precise than others.

In the cultural context of China, Falun Gong is generally described either as a system of qigong, or a type of "cultivation practice" (''xiulian''). Cultivation is a Chinese term that describes the process by which an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning. Varieties of cultivation practice are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian traditions.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, writes "the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system. Cultivation systems have been a feature of Chinese life for at least 2,500 years."&lt;ref name="pennyharrold"&gt;Benjamin Penny, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present, and Future of Falun Gong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325202921/http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html# |date=25 March 2008 }}, Lecture given at the National Library of Australia, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Qigong practices can also be understood as a part of a broader tradition of "cultivation practice".&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

In the West, Falun Gong is frequently classified as a religion on the basis of its theological and moral teachings,&lt;ref name=Madsen/&gt; its concerns with spiritual cultivation and transformation, and its extensive body of scripture.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Human rights groups report on the persecution of Falun Gong as a violation of religious freedom, and in 2001, Falun Gong was given an International Religious Freedom Award from [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners themselves have sometimes disavowed this classification, however. This rejection reflects the relatively narrow definition of "religion" (''zongjiao'') in contemporary China. According to David Ownby, religion in China has been defined since 1912 to refer to "world-historical faiths" that have "well-developed institutions, clergy, and textual traditions"—namely, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php "Unofficial Religions in China: Beyond the Party's Rules"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326193222/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php |date=26 March 2008 }}, Testimony for the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 23 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong lacks these features, having no temples, rituals of worship, clergy or formal hierarchy. Moreover, if Falun Gong had described itself as a religion in China, it likely would have invited immediate suppression.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; These historical and cultural circumstances notwithstanding, the practice has often been described as a form of Chinese religion.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 226. Quote: "Falun Gong is a new form of Chinese religion, even if its adherents themselves may not recognize it as being religion at all."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is often referred to as such in journalistic literature, Falun Gong does not satisfy the definition of a "sect" or "cult."&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; A sect is generally defined as a branch or denomination of an established belief system or mainstream church. Although Falun Gong draws on both Buddhist and Daoist ideas and terminology, it claims no direct relationship or lineage connection to these religions.&lt;ref name=Ownbyming/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong,"  p 26. Quote: "[Falun Gong] claims no immediate predecessor in the sense of asserting its position in a lineage of religions. Nonetheless, as will be clear throughout this book, many of the terms Li Hongzhi uses and the ideas that underpin Falun Gong teachings are found in Chinese religions of the past."&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists regard sects as exclusive groups that exist within clearly defined boundaries, with rigorous standards for admission and strict allegiances.&lt;ref name=chan2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shun-ching Chan|first1=Cheris|title=The Falun Gong in China: A Sociological Perspective|journal=The China Quarterly|date=September 2004|volume=179|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/the-falun-gong-in-china-sociological.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205438/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/the-falun-gong-in-china-sociological.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted by Noah Porter, Falun Gong does not share these qualities: it does not have clearly defined boundaries, and anyone may practice it.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; Cheris Shun-ching Chan likewise writes that Falun Gong is "categorically not a sect": its practitioners do not sever ties with secular society, it is "loosely structured with a ﬂuctuating membership and tolerant of other organizations and faiths," and it is more concerned with personal, rather than collective worship.&lt;ref name=chan2004 /&gt;

==Organization==

As a matter of [[doctrine|doctrinal]] significance, Falun Gong is intended to be "formless", having little to no material or formal organization. Practitioners of Falun Gong cannot collect money or charge fees, conduct healings, or teach or interpret doctrine for others.&lt;ref name=Palmer241&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p&amp;nbsp;241–246&lt;/ref&gt; There are no administrators or officials within the practice, no system of membership, and no churches or physical places of worship.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=porterprof&gt;Noah Porter, "Professional Practitioners and Contact Persons Explicating Special Types of Falun Gong Practitioners", ''Nova Religio'', November 2005, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp 62–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite journal| first=James| last=Tong| title=An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing| journal=[[The China Quarterly]]| volume=171|date=September 2002| pages=636–660| doi=10.1017/S0009443902000402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of membership or initiation rituals, Falun Gong practitioners can be anyone who chooses to identify themselves as such.&lt;ref name="Haar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/faluntext3.html|title=Evaluation and Further References|last=Haar|first=Barendter|accessdate=21 December 2009|quote=One difference between the Falun Gong and traditional groups is the absence of rituals of daily worship or rites of passage|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216071449/http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/faluntext3.html|archivedate=16 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are free to participate in the practice and follow its teachings as much or as little as they like, and practitioners do not instruct others on what to believe or how to behave.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ping/&gt;&lt;ref name=OwnbyCanada&gt;David Ownby, "Falungong and Canada's China Policy," International Journal, Spring 2001, p 193. Quote:"These people have discovered what is to them the truth of the universe. They have arrived freely at this discovery, and, if they change their mind, they are fee to go on to something else. The Falungong community seems to be supportive but not constraining – aside from the peer pressure that exists in many groups situations; there is no visible power structure to chastise a misbehaving practitioner, nor do practitioners tell one another what to do or what to believe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual authority is vested exclusively in the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi.&lt;ref name=Palmer241/&gt; But organizationally Falun Gong is decentralized, and  local branches and assistants are afforded no special privileges, authority, or titles. Volunteer "assistants" or "contact persons" do not hold authority over other practitioners, regardless of how long they have practiced Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=Chou/&gt;&lt;ref name=burgdoff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A Burgdoff|first1=Craig|title=How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/how-falun-gong-practice-undermines-li.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205437/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/how-falun-gong-practice-undermines-li.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li's spiritual authority within the practice is absolute, yet the organization of Falun Gong works against totalistic control, and Li does not intervene in the personal lives of practitioners. Falun Gong practitioners have little to no contact with Li, except through the study of his teachings.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; There is no hierarchy in Falun Gong to enforce orthodoxy, and little or no emphasis is given on dogmatic discipline; the only thing emphasized is the need for strict moral behavior, according to Craig Burgdoff, a professor of religious studies.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt;

To the extent that organization is achieved in Falun Gong, it is accomplished through a global, networked, and largely virtual online community. In particular, electronic communications, email lists and a collection of websites are the primary means of coordinating activities and disseminating Li Hongzhi's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQV2Wi1RdgC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Kevin+McDonald,+Global+Movements:+Action+and+Culture,+chapter+7,+‘Healing+Movements,+embodied+subjects’,+Wiley-Blackwell+(2006)&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Global movements: action and culture | first=Kevin | last=McDonald | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-4051-1613-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Mainland China, a network of volunteer 'contact persons', regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exist in approximately 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html 'Local Contacts'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118225305/http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html |date=18 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Li Hongzhi's teachings are principally spread through the Internet.&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Bell, Taylor C. Boas, ''Falun Gong and the Internet: Evangelism, Community, and Struggle for Survival'', Nova Religio, April 2003, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp 277–293&lt;/ref&gt; In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=fieldnotes&gt;Susan Palmer and David Ownby, ''Field Notes: Falun Dafa Practitioners: A Preliminary Research Report'', Nova Religio, 2000.4.1.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burgdoff, "How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric," p 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Group study sessions typically take place in the evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as "the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'" that Falun Gong offers.&lt;ref name=Ownby313&gt;David Ownby, "Falun Gong in the New World", European Journal of East Asian Studies (2003), pp&amp;nbsp;313–314.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.&lt;ref name=Ownby313/&gt; When there are expenses to be covered (such as for the rental of facilities for large-scale conferences), costs are borne by self-nominated and relatively affluent individual members of the community.&lt;ref name=Ownby313/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burgdoff, "How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric," p 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization within China===
[[File:Origins-GuangzhouPractice.jpg|right|thumb| Morning Falun Dafa exercises, in [[Guangzhou]].]]

In 1993, the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society was accepted as a branch of the state-run China Qigong Research Society (CQRS), which oversaw the administration of the country's various qigong schools, and sponsored activities and seminars. As per the requirements of the CQRS, Falun Gong was organized into a nationwide network of assistance centers, "main stations", "branches", "guidance stations", and local practice sites, mirroring the structure of the qigong society or even of the Communist Party itself.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;Kevin McDonald, Global Movements: Action and Culture, 'Healing Movements, embodied subjects', (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 2006), pp 142 – 164&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong assistants were self-selecting volunteers who taught the exercises, organized events, and disseminated new writings from Li Hongzhi. The Falun Dafa Research Society provided advice to students on meditation techniques, translation services, and coordination for the practice nationwide.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

Following its departure from the CQRS in 1996, Falun Gong came under increased scrutiny from authorities and responded by adopting a more decentralized and loose organizational structure.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; In 1997, the Falun Dafa Research Society was formally dissolved, along with the regional "main stations."&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing," p 641, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660&lt;/ref&gt; Yet practitioners continued to organize themselves at local levels, being connected through electronic communications, interpersonal networks and group exercise sites.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong2009&gt;James Tong, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyxCVRB-De8C&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6&amp;dq=james+tong+revenge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PAXEUO0lAG&amp;sig=Asclwn4AMZASBTPoy1oo-DtsneA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bF-FULFdpPbSAaiUgMAM&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005]" (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-537728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Falun Gong sources and Chinese government sources claimed that there were some 1,900 "guidance stations" and 28,263 local Falun Gong exercise sites nationwide by 1999, though they disagree over the extent of vertical coordination among these organizational units.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing,"  p 642, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the persecution that began in 1999, Falun Gong was driven underground, the organizational structure grew yet more informal within China, and the internet took precedence as a means of connecting practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Thornton, "Manufacturing Dissent in Transnational China", in Popular Protest in China, Kevin J. O'Brien (ed.), (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the persecution of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities sought to portray Falun Gong as a hierarchical and well-funded organization. James Tong writes that it was in the government's interest to portray Falun Gong as highly organized in order to justify its repression of the group: "The more organized the Falun Gong could be shown to be, then the more justified the regime's repression in the name of social order was."&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing," p 638, The China Quarterly, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that Party's claims lacked "both internal and external substantiating evidence", and that despite the arrests and scrutiny, the authorities never "credibly countered Falun Gong rebuttals".&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing," p  657, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic surveys conducted in China in 1998 found a population that was mostly female and elderly. Of 34,351 Falun Gong practitioners surveyed, 27% were male and 73% female. Only 38% were under 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, "Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study," p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong attracted a range of other individuals, from young college students to bureaucrats, intellectuals and Party officials.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kaye, "Travelers Tales," Far Eastern Economic Review, 23 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys in China from the 1990s found that between 23–40% of practitioners held university degrees at the college or graduate level—several times higher than the general population.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

Falun Gong is practiced by tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands outside China,&lt;ref name="David Ownby p 126"/&gt; with the largest communities found in Taiwan and North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York and Toronto. Demographic surveys by Palmer and Ownby in these communities found that 90% of practitioners are ethnic Chinese. The average age was approximately 40.&lt;ref name=Ownby136&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name=Ownby136/&gt;

The most commonly reported reasons for being attracted to Falun Gong were intellectual content, cultivation exercises, and health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Chinese Falun Gong practitioners tend to fit the profile of "spiritual seekers"—people who had tried a variety of qigong, yoga, or religious practices before finding Falun Gong. According to Richard Madsen{{who?|reason=Who is Richard Madsen? Is he notable? And why is it important to mention his name?|date=September 2018}}, Chinese scientists with doctorates from prestigious American universities who practice Falun Gong claim that modern physics (for example, superstring theory) and biology (specifically the [[pineal gland]]'s function) provide a scientific basis for their beliefs. From their point of view, "Falun Dafa is knowledge rather than religion, a new form of science rather than faith".&lt;ref name=Madsen&gt;Richard Madsen, "Understanding Falun Gong," Current History (September 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History inside China==
{{Main article|History of Falun Gong}}

===1992–1996===
Li Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong to the public on 13 May 1992, in Changchun, [[Jilin]] Province.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; Several months later, in September 1992, Falun Gong was admitted as a branch of qigong under the administration of the state-run China Qigong Scientific Research Society (CQRS). Li was recognized as a qigong master, and was authorized to teach his practice nationwide.&lt;ref name="Ownby (2003)"&gt;David Ownby, "The Falun Gong in the New World". European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep 2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many ''qigong'' masters at the time, Li toured major cities in China from 1992 to 1994 to teach the practice. He was granted a number of awards by PRC governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name="pennyharrold"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zfl&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/rnadeau/Chinese%20Religions/Li%20Hongzhi.htm A Short Biography of Mr. Li Hongzhi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128133954/http://www.trinity.edu/rnadeau/Chinese%20Religions/Li%20Hongzhi.htm# |date=28 November 2004 }}, PRC law and Government v. 32 no. 6 (November/December 1999) p.&amp;nbsp;14–23 {{ISSN|0009-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Jennifer. "Witnessing history: one Chinese woman's fight for freedom," Soho Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Ownby, Professor of History and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Université de Montréal, Li became an "instant star of the qigong movement",&lt;ref name="Ownbyworld"&gt;David Ownby, "The Falun Gong in the New World". European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306&lt;/ref&gt; and Falun Gong was embraced by the government as an effective means of lowering health care costs, promoting Chinese culture, and improving public morality. In December 1992, for instance, Li and several Falun Gong students participated in the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, where he reportedly "received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results", according to the fair's organizer.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; The event helped cement Li's popularity, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong's healing powers spread.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; In 1993, a publication of the Ministry of Public Security praised Li for "promoting the traditional crime-fighting virtues of the Chinese people, in safeguarding social order and security, and in promoting rectitude in society."&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/topic/24/ "Falun Gong: Timeline"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227024612/http://faluninfo.net/topic/24/# |date=27 December 2008 }}, 18 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong had differentiated itself from other ''qigong'' groups in its emphasis on morality, low cost, and health benefits. It rapidly spread via word-of-mouth, attracting a wide range of practitioners from all walks of life, including numerous members of the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;&lt;ref name=lum&gt;Thomas Lum, [http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf Congressional Research Report #RL33437] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205064042/http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf |date=5 February 2012 }}, Congressional Research Service, 11 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 1994, Li did charge fees for the seminars he was giving across China, though the fees were considerably lower than those of competing qigong practices, and the local qigong associations received a substantial share.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; Li justified the fees as being necessary to cover travel costs and other expenses, and on some occasions, he donated the money earned to charitable causes. In 1994, Li ceased charging fees altogether, thereafter stipulating that Falun Gong must always be taught for free, and its teachings made available without charge (including online).&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some observers believe Li continued to earn substantial income through the sale of Falun Gong books,&lt;ref&gt;Dai Qing: Members of Falungong in an Autocratic Society. Asia Quarterly, Volume IV, No.3, Summer 2000 {{cite web |url=http://asiaquarterly.com/2006/01/28/ii-45/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402115951/http://asiaquarterly.com/2006/01/28/ii-45/ |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; others dispute this, noting that most Falun Gong books in circulation were bootleg copies.&lt;ref name=wildgrass/&gt;

[[File:92@93OrtHealthExpoAward4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|At the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, 1994, Li Hongzhi is proclaimed the "Most Acclaimed Qigong Master." Falun Gong also received the "Special Gold Award" and award for "Advancing Frontier Science."]]
With the publication of the books ''Falun Gong'' and ''[[Teachings of Falun Gong#Zhuan Falun, the Main Book of Falun Gong|Zhuan Falun]]'', Li made his teachings more widely accessible. ''Zhuan Falun'', published in January 1995 at an unveiling ceremony held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security, became a best-seller in China.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, "Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?," p 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Chinese authorities began looking to Falun Gong to solidify its organizational structure and ties to the party-state.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; Li was approached by the Chinese National Sports Committee, Ministry of Public Health, and China Qigong Science Research Association (CQRS) to jointly establish a Falun Gong association. Li declined the offer. The same year, the CQRS issued a new regulation mandating that all qigong denominations establish a Communist Party branch. Li again refused.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Tensions continued to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996. In the face of Falun Gong's rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing ''qigong'' masters accused Li of undercutting them. According to Schechter, the ''qigong'' society under which Li and other ''qigong'' masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized the need for the teachings to be free of charge.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;

In March 1996, in response to mounting disagreements, Falun Gong withdrew from the CQRS, after which time it operated outside the official sanction of the state. Falun Gong representatives attempted to register with other government entities, but were rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Li and Falun Gong were then outside the circuit of personal relations and financial exchanges through which masters and their ''qigong'' organizations could find a place within the state system, and also the protections this afforded.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–1999===
Falun Gong's departure from the state-run CQRS corresponded to a wider shift in the government's attitudes towards qigong practices. As qigong's detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting to rein in the growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Falun Gong was initially shielded from the mounting criticism, but following its withdrawal from the CQRS in March 1996, it lost this protection. On 17 June 1996, the ''Guangming Daily'', an influential state-run newspaper, published a polemic against Falun Gong in which its central text, ''Zhuan Falun'', was described as an example of "feudal superstition."&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer249&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The author wrote that the history of humanity is a "struggle between science and superstition," and called on Chinese publishers not to print "pseudo-scientific books of the swindlers." The article was followed by at least twenty more in newspapers nationwide. Soon after, on 24 July, the Central Propaganda Department banned all publication of Falun Gong books (though the ban was not consistently enforced).&lt;ref name=Palmer249/&gt; The state-administered Buddhist Association of China also began issuing criticisms of Falun Gong, urging lay Buddhists not to take up the practice.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events were an important challenge to Falun Gong, and one that practitioners did not take lightly.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Falun Gong followers wrote to ''Guangming Daily'' and to the CQRS to complain against the measures, claiming that they violated [[Hu Yaobang]]'s 1982 'Triple No' directive, which prohibited the media from either encouraging or criticizing qigong practices.&lt;ref name=Palmer249/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sumner B. Twiss, "Religious Intolerance in Contemporary China, Including the Curious Case of Falun Gong," The World's Religions After 11 September, by Arvind Sharma (ed.) (Greenwood Publishing, 2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;227–240.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, Falun Gong practitioners staged peaceful demonstrations outside media or local government offices to request retractions of perceived unfair coverage.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

The polemics against Falun Gong were part of a larger movement opposing qigong organizations in the state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Falun Gong was not the only target of the media criticism, nor the only group to protest, theirs was the most mobilized and steadfast response.&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; Many of Falun Gong's protests against negative media portrayals were successful, resulting in the retraction of several newspaper stories critical of the practice. This contributed to practitioners' belief that the media claims against them were false or exaggerated, and that their stance was justified.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, [[He Zuoxiu]], an outspoken critic of qigong and a fierce defender of Marxism, appeared on a talk show on [[Beijing Television]] and openly disparaged ''qigong'' groups, making particular mention of Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," pp 134 &amp; pp&amp;nbsp;252–256&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners responded with peaceful protests and by lobbying the station for a retraction. The reporter responsible for the program was reportedly fired, and a program favorable to Falun Gong was aired several days later.&lt;ref name="Jude Howell"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H80YZqSj7EEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Governance+in+China+~+Jude+Howell#v=onepage&amp;q= |work=Governance in China |editor= Jude Howell |first=Clemens Stubbe |last=Østergaard |pages=214–223 |title=Governance and the Political Challenge of Falun Gong |year=2003 |isbn=0-7425-1988-0 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, Md.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dangerous&gt;{{Cite book|last=Human Right Watch|author2=Mickey Spiegel|title=Dangerous meditation: China's campaign against Falungong|location=New York|year=2001|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners also mounted demonstrations at 14 other media outlets.&lt;ref name="Jude Howell" /&gt;

In 1997, The Ministry of Public Security launched an investigation into whether Falun Gong should be deemed xie jiao (邪教, "heretical teaching"). The report concluded that "no evidence has appeared thus far".&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, on 21 July 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued Document No. 555, "Notice of the Investigation of Falun Gong". The document asserted that Falun Gong is a "heretical teaching", and mandated that another investigation be launched to seek evidence in support of the conclusion.&lt;ref name=Palmer267/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners reported having phone lines tapped, homes ransacked and raided, and Falun Gong exercise sites disrupted by public security agents.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

[[File:1999Chi Master Procshort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Li Hongzhi (right) receiving a proclamation from the [[Governor of Illinois]] in 1999]]
In this time period, even as criticism of qigong and Falun Gong mounted in some circles, the practice maintained a number of high-profile supporters in the government. In 1998, [[Qiao Shi]], the recently retired [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], initiated his own investigation into Falun Gong. After months of investigations, his group concluded that "Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the Chinese people and China, and does not have one single bad effect."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, China's National Sports Commission launched its own survey of Falun Gong. Based on interviews with over 12,000 Falun Gong practitioners in [[Guangdong]] province,&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; they stated that they were "convinced the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are excellent. It has done an extraordinary amount to improve society's stability and ethics."

The practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, was largely absent from the country during the period of rising tensions with the government. In  March 1995, Li had left China to first teach his practice in France and then other countries, and in 1998 obtained permanent residency in the United States.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name="GallagherAshcraft2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eugene V.

By 1999, estimates provided by the State Sports Commission suggested there were 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China.&lt;ref name=Faison/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renee Schoff, "Growing group poses a dilemma for China", Associated Press, 26 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous employee of China's National Sports Commission, was at this time quoted in an interview with U.S. News &amp; World Report as speculating that if 100 million had taken up Falun Gong and other forms of qigong there would be a dramatic reduction of health care costs and that "Premier Zhu Rongji is very happy about that."&lt;ref name=BayFang/&gt;

===Tianjin and Zhongnanhai protests===
By the late 1990s, the Communist Party's relationship to the growing Falun Gong movement had become increasingly tense. Reports of discrimination and surveillance by the Public Security Bureau were escalating, and Falun Gong practitioners were routinely organizing sit-in demonstrations responding to media articles they deemed to be unfair. The conflicting investigations launched by the Ministry of the Public Security on one side and the State Sports Commission and Qiao Shi on the other spoke of the disagreements among China's elites on how to regard the growing practice.

In April 1999, an article critical of Falun Gong was published in [[Tianjin Normal University]]'s ''Youth Reader'' magazine. The article was authored by physicist He Zuoxiu who, as Porter and Gutmann note, is a relative of Politburo member and public security [[Party secretary|secretary]] [[Luo Gan]].&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt; The article cast qigong, and Falun Gong in particular, as superstitious and harmful for youth.&lt;ref name=hezuoxiu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnfxj.org/Html/lgxd/2007-6/24/165513641.html#|title=I do not agree with Youth Practicing ''Qigong'' (我不赞成青少年炼气功)|author=He Zuoxiu|language=Chinese|year=1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714235247/http://www.cnfxj.org/Html/lgxd/2007-6/24/165513641.html|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners responded by picketing the offices of the newspaper requesting a retraction of the article.&lt;ref name=Palmer267&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike past instances in which Falun Gong protests were successful, on 22 April the Tianjin demonstration was broken up by the arrival of three hundred riot police. Some of the practitioners were beaten, and forty-five arrested.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer267/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby171&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other Falun Gong practitioners were told that if they wished to appeal further, they needed to take the issue up with the Ministry of Public Security and go to Beijing to appeal.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou&gt;[[Ethan Gutmann]] (20 July 2009) [http://www.david-kilgour.com/2009/Jul_05_2009_04.php "An Occurrence on Fuyou Street"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604114413/http://www.david-kilgour.com/2009/Jul_05_2009_04.php# |date=4 June 2013 }}, National Review david-kilgour.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby171/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, "Falun Gong's Challenge to China," p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:25April1999Zhongnanhai.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Falun Gong adherents demonstrate in front of Zhongnanhai, 25 April 1999.]]
The Falun Gong community quickly mobilized a response, and on the morning of 25 April, upwards of 10,000 practitioners gathered near the central appeals office to demand an end to the escalating harassment against the movement, and request the release of the Tianjin practitioners. According to Benjamin Penny, practitioners sought redress from the leadership of the country by going to them and, "albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily."&lt;ref name="pennyharrold" /&gt; Journalist [[Ethan Gutmann]] wrote that security officers had been expecting them, and corralled the practitioners onto Fuyou Street in front of Zhongnanhai government compound.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt; They sat or read quietly on the sidewalks surrounding the Zhongnanhai.&lt;ref name=Tong5&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Falun Gong representatives met with Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] and other senior officials to negotiate a resolution. The Falun Gong representatives were assured that the regime supported physical exercises for health improvements and did not consider the Falun Gong to be anti-government.&lt;ref name=Tong5/&gt; Upon reaching this resolution, the crowd of Falun Gong protesters dispersed.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt;

[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] was alerted to the demonstration by [[CPC Politburo]] member Luo Gan,&lt;ref name=Zong/&gt; and was reportedly angered by the audacity of the demonstration—the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests ten years earlier. Jiang called for resolute action to suppress the group,&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt; and reportedly criticized Premier Zhu for being "too soft" in his handling of the situation.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; That evening, Jiang composed a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong "defeated". In the letter, Jiang expressed concerns over the size and popularity of Falun Gong, and in particular about the large number of senior Communist Party members found among Falun Gong practitioners. He noted the possibility of foreign forces behind Falun Gong's protests (the practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, had emigrated to the United States), and expressed concern about their use of the internet to coordinate a large-scale demonstration. Jiang also intimated that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was at odds with the [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|atheist values of Marxist–Leninism]], and therefore constituted a form of ideological competition.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Zemin, Letter to Party cadres on the evening of 25 April 1999. Published in Beijing Zhichun no. 97 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for this decision to persecute Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=peerman&gt;Dean Peerman, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628140710/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_16_121/ai_n8702386/pg_4 China syndrome: the persecution of Falun Gong], Christian Century, 10 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saich&gt;Tony Saich, ''Governance and Politics in China,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition (27 February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich points to Jiang's anger at Falun Gong's widespread appeal, and ideological struggle as causes for the crackdown that followed.

===Speculation on rationale===
Foreign observers have attempted to explain the Party's rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors. These include Falun Gong's popularity, China's history of quasi-religious movements that turned into violent insurrections, its independence from the state and refusal to toe the party line, internal power politics within the Communist Party—and Falun Gong's moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with aspects of the official [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]].

[[File:610 Office.jpg|thumb|right|610 Office's organization in China.]]
Xinhua News Agency, the official news organization of the Communist Party, declared that Falun Gong is "opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government, preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition."&lt;ref name="english.peopledaily.com.cn"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/199908/02/enc_19990802001003_TopNews.html Xinhua Commentary on Political Nature of Falun Gong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110040730/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/199908/02/enc_19990802001003_TopNews.html# |date=10 January 2008 }}, People's Daily, 2 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Xinhua also asserted that "the so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve", and argued that it was necessary to crush Falun Gong to preserve the "vanguard role and purity" of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=hanson1999&gt;Gayle M.B.

Willy Wo-Lap Lam writes that Jiang Zemin's campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying "by unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line."&lt;ref&gt;Willy Wo-Lap Lam, "China's sect suppression carries a high price".

Yuezhi Zhao points to several other factors that may have led to a deterioration of the relationship between Falun Gong and the Chinese state and media.&lt;ref name="zhao" /&gt; These included infighting within China's qigong establishment, the influence of qigong opponents among Communist Party leaders, and the struggles from mid-1996 to mid-1999 between Falun Gong and the Chinese power elite over the status and treatment of the movement.&lt;ref name="zhao" /&gt; According to Zhao, Falun Gong practitioners have established a "resistance identity"—one that stands against prevailing pursuits of wealth, power, scientific rationality, and "the entire value system associated with China's project of modernization."&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; In China the practice represented an indigenous spiritual and moral tradition, a cultural revitalization movement, and drew a sharp contrast to "Marxism with Chinese characteristics".&lt;ref name="twiss"&gt;Twiss, Sumner B.

[[Vivienne Shue]] similarly writes that Falun Gong presented a comprehensive challenge to the Communist Party's legitimacy. Shue argues that Chinese rulers historically have derived their legitimacy from a claim to possess an exclusive connection to the "Truth". In imperial China, truth was based on a [[Confucian]] and Daoist cosmology, where in the case of the Communist Party, the truth is represented by Marxist–Leninism and historical materialism. Falun Gong challenged the Marxist–Leninism paradigm, reviving an understanding based on more traditionally Buddhist or Daoist conceptions.&lt;ref name=Shue&gt;Vivienne Shue, "Legitimacy Crisis in China?" In Peter Hays Gries and Stanley Rosen (eds.), State and Society in 21st-century China. Crisis, Contention, and Legitimation, New York: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; David Ownby contends that Falun Gong also challenged the Communist Party's hegemony over Chinese nationalist discourse: "[Falun Gong's] evocation of a different vision of Chinese tradition and its contemporary value is now so threatening to the state and party because it denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chinese nationalism, and perhaps of Chineseness."&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby (15 February 2001)  [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/15/opinion/china-s-war-against-itself.html China's War Against Itself] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rahn, the history of this paradigm goes back to the collapse of the Han dynasty: "The pattern of ruling power keeping a watchful eye on sectarian groups, at times threatened by them, at times raising campaigns against them, began as early as the second century and continued throughout the dynastic period, through the Mao era and into the present."&lt;ref name="Rahn2002"&gt;Rahn, Patsy (2002) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tpv/2002/00000014/00000004/art00004 "The Chemistry of a Conflict: The Chinese Government and the Falun Gong"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025151245/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tpv/2002/00000014/00000004/art00004# |date=25 October 2012 }} in ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Winter, 2002, Vol 14, No. 4 (London: Frank Cass Publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion program===
[[File:FalunDafa Burn tanyongjie.jpg|thumb|left|Falun Gong practitioner Tang Yongjie was tortured by prison guards, who applied hot rods to his legs in an attempt to force him to recant his beliefs.]] 
According to James Tong, the regime aimed at both coercive dissolution of the Falun Gong denomination and "transformation" of the practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the Party upped its campaign by sentencing "recidivist" practitioners to "[[re-education through labor]]", in an effort to have them renounce their beliefs and "transform" their thoughts.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Terms were also arbitrarily extended by police, while some practitioners had ambiguous charges levied against them, such as "disrupting social order", "endangering national security", or "subverting the socialist system".&lt;ref name=bejesky&gt;Robert Bejesky, "Falun Gong &amp; reeducation through labor", ''Columbia Journal of Asian Law'', 17:2, Spring 2004, pp. 147–89&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bejesky, the majority of long-term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system instead of the criminal justice system. Upon completion of their re-education sentences, those practitioners who refused to recant were then incarcerated in "legal education centers" set up by provincial authorities to "transform minds".&lt;ref name="bejesky"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CECC2009&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China Annual Report 2006, p. 59; note 224, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the conversion program relied on Mao-style techniques of indoctrination and [[Thought reform in the People's Republic of China|thought reform]], where Falun Gong practitioners were organized to view anti-Falun Gong television programs and enroll in Marxism and materialism study sessions.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Marxism and materialism were the core content of the sessions.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government-sponsored image of the conversion process emphasizes psychological persuasion and a variety of "soft-sell" techniques; this is the "ideal norm" in regime reports, according to Tong. Falun Gong reports, on the other hand, depict "disturbing and sinister" forms of coercion against practitioners who fail to renounce their beliefs.&lt;ref name=tong122-128&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," pp.&amp;nbsp;122–28.&lt;/ref&gt; 14,474 cases are classified by different methods of torture, according to Tong (Falun Gong agencies document over 63,000 individual cases of torture).&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://www.faluninfo.net/topic/3/ Persecution FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127075250/http://www.faluninfo.net/topic/3/# |date=27 November 2010 }}.

The cases appear verifiable, and the great majority identify (1) the individual practitioner, often with age, occupation, and residence; (2) the time and location that the alleged abuse took place, down to the level of the district, township, village, and often the specific jail institution; and (3) the names and ranks of the alleged perpetrators. Many such reports include lists of the names of witnesses and descriptions of injuries, Tong says.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt; The publication of "persistent abusive, often brutal behavior by named individuals with their official title, place, and time of torture" suggests that there is no official will to cease and desist such activities.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt;

===Deaths===
Due to the difficulty in corroborating reports of torture deaths in China, estimates on the number of Falun Gong practitioners killed under persecution vary widely. In 2009, the New York Times reported that, according to human rights groups, the repressions had claimed "at least 2,000" lives.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The [[Kilgour-Matas report]]&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;&lt;ref name=theage060708&gt;Reuters, AP (8 July 2006) [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/falun-gong-organ-claim-supported/2006/07/07/1152240489760.html "Falun Gong organ claim supported"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531070407/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/falun-gong-organ-claim-supported/2006/07/07/1152240489760.html# |date=31 May 2014 }}, ''The Age'', (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ottawa&gt;Endemann, Kirstin (6 July 2006) CanWest News Service; ''Ottawa Citizen'' [http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=290fed94-d0c2-4265-8686-54ce75d08eca&amp;k=34245 "Ottawa urged to stop Canadians travelling to China for transplants"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017095219/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=290fed94-d0c2-4265-8686-54ce75d08eca&amp;k=34245 |date=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in July 2006, and concluded that "the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centers and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience." The report, which was based mainly on circumstantial evidence, called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year.

===Media campaign===
The Chinese government's campaign against Falun Gong was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspapers, radio and internet.&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leung" /&gt;  
Within the first month of the crackdown, 300–400 articles attacking Falun Gong appeared in each of the main state-run papers, while primetime television replayed alleged exposés on the group, with no divergent views aired in the media.&lt;ref name="lemish"&gt;Leeshai Lemish, [http://www.cesnur.org/2009/slc_lemish.htm "Media and New Religious Movements: The Case of Falun Gong"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418053706/http://www.cesnur.org/2009/slc_lemish.htm# |date=18 April 2015 }}, A paper presented at The 2009 CESNUR Conference, Salt Lake City, Utah, 11–13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was "anti-science" and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

China scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith asserted that for several months after Falun Gong was outlawed, China Central Television's evening news contained little but anti-Falun Gong rhetoric; the government operation was "a study in all-out demonization", they wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Fewsmith, Joseph and Daniel B. Wright. "The promise of the Revolution: stories of fulfilment and struggle in China", 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong was compared to "a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts out to squash" by ''Beijing Daily'';&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "'Enemies of people' warned", 23 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; other officials said it would be a "long-term, complex and serious" struggle to "eradicate" Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;Plafker, Ted. "Falun Gong Stays Locked In Struggle With Beijing," The Washington Post, 26 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in "complete opposition to science" and communism.&lt;ref name=Lu2004&gt;Lu, Xing, ''Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: the impact on Chinese thought, culture, and communication,'' University of South Carolina Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''People's Daily'' asserted on 27 July 1999, that the fight against Falun Gong "was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism." Other editorials declared that Falun Gong's "idealism and theism" are "absolutely contradictory to the
fundamental theories and principles of Marxism," and that the "'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve." Suppressing Falun Gong was presented as a necessary step to maintaining the "vanguard role" of the Communist Party in Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Chiung Hwang. "Framing Falun Gong: Xinhua News Agency's Coverage of the New Religious Movement in China", Asian Journal of Communication, Vol. 15 No. 1 (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the persecution of the group. In the months following July 1999, the rhetoric in the state-run press escalated to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign, "anti-China" forces. In October 1999, three months after the persecution began, the [[People Daily]] newspaper claimed Falun Gong as a ''xiejiao''.&lt;ref name=irons2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irons|first1=Edward|title=Falun Gong and the Sectarian Religion Paradigm|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/falun-gong-and-sectarian-religion.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205340/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/falun-gong-and-sectarian-religion.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chan2004 /&gt; A direct translation of that term is "heretical teaching", but during the anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign was rendered as "evil [[cult]]" in English.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;Amnesty International (23 March 2000) [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/011/2000/en/ The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called 'heretical organizations'] &lt;/ref&gt; In the context of imperial China, the term "xiejiao" was used to refer to non-Confucian religions, though in the context of Communist China, it has been used to target religious organizations that do not submit to Communist Party authority.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Hsia Chang, "Falun Gong:The End of Days," (Yale University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House, [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Analysis_of_China_Docs_1_to_7.pdf "Report Analyzing Seven Secret Chinese Government Documents"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/62n1StDL3?url=http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Analysis_of_China_Docs_1_to_7.pdf |date=29 October 2011 }}, 11 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Denis Johnson|Ian Johnson]] argued that applying the 'cult' label to Falun Gong effectively "cloaked the government's crackdown with the legitimacy of the West's anticult movement."  He notes, however, that Falun Gong does not satisfy common definitions of a cult: "its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs, do not live isolated from society, do not believe that the world's end is imminent and do not give significant amounts of money to the organisation&amp;nbsp;... it does not advocate violence and is at heart an apolitical, inward-oriented discipline, one aimed at cleansing oneself spiritually and improving one's health."&lt;ref name="wildgrass"/&gt; David Ownby similarly wrote that "the entire issue of the supposed cultic nature of Falun Gong was a red herring from the beginning, cleverly exploited by the Chinese state to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong.".&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture /&gt; According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an "apolitical, qigong exercise club," it was not seen as a threat to the government. The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong suppression campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of "negatively charged religious labels",&lt;ref name=powerslee&gt;Powers, John and Meg Y. M. Lee. "Dueling Media: Symbolic Conflict in China's Falun Gong Suppression Campaign" in Chinese Conflict Management and Resolution, by Guo-Ming Chen and Ringo Ma (2001), Greenwood Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; like "evil cult", "sect", or "superstition". The group's silent protests were reclassified as creating "social disturbances". In this process of relabelling, the government was attempting to tap into a "deep reservoir of negative feelings related to the historical role of quasi-religious cults as a destabilising force in Chinese political history."&lt;ref name=powerslee/&gt;

A turning point in the propaganda campaign came on the eve of [[Chinese New Year]] on 23 January 2001, when [[Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident|five people attempted to set themselves ablaze]] on Tiananmen Square.

IED's statement at the 53rd UN session describes China's violent assault on Falun Gong practitioners as state terrorism and that the self-immolation "was staged by the government."

In February, 2001, the month following the Tiananmen Square incident, Jiang Zemin convened a rare Central Work Conference to stress the importance of continuity in the anti-Falun Gong campaign and unite senior party officials behind the effort.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Under Jiang's leadership, the crackdown on Falun Gong became part of the Chinese political ethos of "upholding stability" – much the same rhetoric employed by the party during [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen in 1989]]. Jiang's message was echoed at the 2001 National People's Congress, where the Falun Gong's eradication was tied to China's economic progress.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Though less prominent on the national agenda, the persecution of Falun Gong has carried on after Jiang was retired; successive, high-level "strike hard" campaigns against Falun Gong were initiated in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to renew attempts at the coercive "transformation" of Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=154369&amp;PHPSESSID=5fbbb671b469039d4ec2ae47774039bd "Communist Party Calls for Increased Efforts To "Transform" Falun Gong Practitioners as Part of Three-Year Campaign"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622035126/http://cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=154369&amp;PHPSESSID=bb43fa72510b8818664943d558abc3a0# |date=22 June 2011 }}, 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In education system====
Anti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts have also permeated the Chinese education system. Following Jiang Zemin's 1999 ban of Falun Gong, then-Minister of Education Chen Zhili launched an active campaign to promote the Party's line on Falun Gong within all levels of academic institutions, including graduate schools, universities and colleges, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. Her efforts included a "Cultural Revolution-like pledge" in Chinese schools that required faculty members, staff, and students to publicly denounce Falun Gong. Teachers who did not comply with Chen's program were dismissed or detained; uncooperative students were refused academic advancement, expelled from school, or sent to "transformation" camps to alter their thinking.&lt;ref name="specialtribunal.org"&gt;[http://www.specialtribunal.org/downloads/WOIPFG_MinistryOfEducation_Part1.pdf "Chinese Ministry of Education Participating in Persecution of Falun Gong: Investigative Report"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927053846/http://www.specialtribunal.org/downloads/WOIPFG_MinistryOfEducation_Part1.pdf# |date=27 September 2004 }}. 16 March 2004. Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Chen also worked to spread the anti-Falun Gong academic propaganda movement overseas, using domestic educational funding to donate aid to foreign institutions, encouraging them to oppose Falun Gong.&lt;ref name="specialtribunal.org"/&gt;

===Falun Gong's response to the persecution===
[[File:Protesting the Persecution of Falun Gong in Washington DC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Practitioners meditate to protest the persecution of Falun Gong at a demonstration in Washington, DC.]]
Falun Gong's response to the persecution in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial, and central petitioning offices in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal and Erik Eckholm, "Vast Numbers of Sect Members Keep Pressure on Beijing" New York Times, 28 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice. These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested—sometimes violently—and detained. By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested on the square;&lt;ref name="johnson2000"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6464 |title=Defiant Falun Dafa Members Converge on Tiananmen |first=Ian |last=Johnson |date=25 April 2000 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Pulitzer.org |page=A21 |access-date=10 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229022658/http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6464# |archive-date=29 December 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Elizabeth J. |last=Selden |author2=Perry, Mark |title=Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-30170-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public protests continued well into 2001. Writing for the ''Wall Street Journal'', Ian Johnson wrote that "Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule."&lt;ref name=DE&gt;Ian Johnson, [http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6463 "A Deadly Exercise: Practicing Falun Gong was a right, Ms. Chen said, to her last day"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008043846/http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6463# |date=8 October 2009 }}, Wall Street Journal, 20 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground "material sites," which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door.&lt;ref&gt;Liao Yiwu. "The Corpse Walker: Real Life Stories: China from the Bottom Up." p 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exist across China today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faluninfo.net/article/1041/Falun-Gong-Beliefs-and-Demographics-/ "2010 Annual Report: Falun Gong Beliefs and Demography of Practitioners"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103172615/http://www.faluninfo.net/article/1041/Falun-Gong-Beliefs-and-Demographics-/# |date=3 January 2015 }} Falun Dafa Information Center, 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China [http://www.cecc.gov/publications/annual-reports/2009-annual-report 2009 Annual Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225023828/http://www.cecc.gov/publications/annual-reports/2009-annual-report# |date=25 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content. One of the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in [[Changchun]] intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled "Self-Immolation or a Staged Act?". All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months. Two were killed immediately, while the other four were all dead by 2010 as a result of injuries sustained while imprisoned.&lt;ref name=mediacontrol&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fog of Censorship: Media Control in China|year=2008|publisher=Human Rights in China|isbn=978-0-9717356-2-0|pages=xii|url=http://hrichina.org/sites/default/files/oldsite/PDFs/Reports/HRIC-Fog-of-Censorship.pdf|author=He Qinglian|authorlink=He Qinglian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229083633/http://hrichina.org/sites/default/files/oldsite/PDFs/Reports/HRIC-Fog-of-Censorship.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ws-20101206&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutmann|first=Ethan|title=Into Thin Airwaves|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/thin-airwaves_519589.html?nopager=1|newspaper=The Weekly Standard|date=6 December 2010|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105190542/http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/thin-airwaves_519589.html?nopager=1#|archive-date=5 January 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media. These include [[The Epoch Times]] newspaper, [[NTDTV|New Tang Dynasty Television]], and [[Sound of Hope]] radio station.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; According to Zhao, through ''The Epoch Times'' it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a "de facto media alliance" with China's democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government.&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; In 2004, ''The Epoch Times'' published a collection of nine editorials that presented a critical history of Communist Party rule.&lt;ref name=Ping/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Kevin. 'Revolution number nine', ''The Western Standard'', 11 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This catalyzed the [[Tuidang movement]], which encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the [[Communist Youth League of China|Communist Youth League]] and [[Young Pioneers of China|Young Pioneers]]. ''The Epoch Times'' claims that tens of millions have renounced the Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Ethan.

Li Hongzhi began teaching Falun Gong internationally in March 1995. His first stop was in Paris where, at the invitation of the Chinese ambassador, he held a lecture seminar at the PRC embassy. This was followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Falun Gong's growth outside China largely corresponded to the migration of students from Mainland China to the West in the early- to mid-1990s. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;Noah Porter (Master's Thesis for the University of South Florida).

Translations of Falun Gong teachings began appearing in the late 1990s. As the practice began proliferating outside China, Li Hongzhi was beginning to receive recognition in the United States and elsewhere in the western world. In May 1999, Li was welcomed to [[Toronto]] with greetings from the [[Mayor of Toronto|city's mayor]] and the provincial [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|lieutenant governor]], and in the two months that followed also received recognition from the cities of  [[Chicago]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Cheris Shun-ching (2004).

Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency in the 1990s, it remained relatively unknown outside China until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] authorities became a subject of international media coverage.  With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China.  Following the launch of the Communist Party's suppression campaign against Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners overseas have responded to the persecution in China through regular demonstrations, parades, and through the creation of media outlets, performing arts companies, and censorship-circumvention software mainly intended to reach Mainland Chinese audiences.&lt;ref name="Beiser, Vince 2010"/&gt;

[[Ethan Gutmann]], a journalist reporting on China since the early 1990s, has attempted to explain this apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum", Gutmann writes. Moreover, practitioners' attempts at getting their message across carried some of the uncouthness of Communist party culture, including a perception that practitioners tended to exaggerate, create "torture tableaux straight out of a Cultural Revolution opera", or "spout slogans rather than facts". This is coupled with a general doubtfulness in the West of persecuted refugees.&lt;ref name=gutmann&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/824qbcjr.asp|title=China's Gruesome Organ Harvest.

Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to suppression.&lt;ref name=Madsen247/&gt;

In August 2007 at the request of the Falun Gong, the newly reestablished Rabbinic [[2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin]] deliberated persecution of the movement by Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3439266,00.html# |title=YNet: Self-appointed Torah court takes on China |access-date=18 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623183853/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3439266,00.html# |archive-date=23 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/132050# |title=Israel National News: Sanhedrin May Hear Complaint against Chinese Torture |access-date=18 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610020200/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/132050# |archive-date=10 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nfc.co.il/Archive/001-D-138226-00.html?tag=10-17-51# |title=NFC: International Court of Justice, according to the laws of the torah |access-date=18 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120730/http://www.nfc.co.il/Archive/001-D-138226-00.html?tag=10-17-51# |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5186">In [[linguistics]], '''feminization''' has two mutually independent meanings.

First, it refers to the process of re-classifying [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s which as such refer to male beings, including [[Job|occupational]] terms, as feminine. This is done most of the time by adding inflectional [[suffix]]es denoting a female (such as the standard suffix ''[[wiktionary:-ess|-ess]]'' in English, and its equivalent ''[[wiktionary:-a#Spanish|-a]]'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mINlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2635&amp;lpg=PA2635&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p4RDWcmlbX&amp;sig=Q4QgBWuZOuhR6JYYfRCgYWhJKRw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_t6AiPPPAhXCLMAKHYZrCoUQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22&amp;f=false|title=Word-Formation: An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe|last=Müller|first=Peter|date=2016|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|isbn=|location=|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages with [[grammatical gender]], for example [[Dutch language|Dutch]], there is a tendency to assign the feminine gender to certain – in particular [[Abstract noun|abstract]] – nouns which are originally masculine or neuter. This also happened to some words in [[Middle English]] (which, in contrast to [[Modern English]], had grammatical gender) which denoted virtue and vice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=pfKty8gnVPAC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22+pronouns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LCmbB2_R7l&amp;sig=q4qJrYFWpBr_skuQXYlgCpRSmFs&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAppigkfPPAhVIJMAKHXwcBREQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22%20pronouns&amp;f=false|title=English Historical Linguistics and Philology in Japan|author=Jacek Fisiak, Akio Oizumi|date=1998|publisher=|isbn=|location=|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Modern English, in spite of it being a [[gender-neutral language]], certain non-human things that are usually neuter are still sometimes feminized by way of [[figure of speech]], especially countries and ships (see also {{slink|Gender in English|Ships}}, {{slink|Gender in English|Modern English}}).

== In Feminist Theory ==
Feminists believe the use of the generic masculine to refer to someone who's gender is unknown erases women and should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mucchi-Faina|first=Angelica|date=2016-06-30|title=Visible or influential?

== Feminization in Various Languages ==

=== French ===
Double gender marking is prevalent in radical political pamphlets and manifestos. This is difficult to track, however, as these types of publications are written by many groups and tend to be published by organizations that don't keep detailed records of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbou|first=Julie|date=2011-02-01|title=Double gender marking in French: a linguistic practice of antisexism|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14664208.2010.541387|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=12|issue=1|pages=55–75|doi=10.1080/14664208.2010.541387|issn=1466-4208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian ===
Female members of a profession can be referred to with the masculine ending -e (eg. presidente) or the feminine -essa (eg. presidentessa). A 2001 study by Mucchi-Faina and Barro showed that women professionals are more persuasive when using the masculine ending while a 2012 study by Merkel et al. show there was no difference in perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=Elisa|last2=Maass|first2=Anne|last3=Frommelt|first3=Laura|date=2012-05-16|title=Shielding Women Against Status Loss|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X12446599|journal=Journal of Language and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=311–320|doi=10.1177/0261927x12446599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian ===
Noun declension is asymmetrical in Russian. Women can be referred to with suffixes of the first or second declension but men can only be referred to with first declension suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gurevich|first=Olga|date=2006|title=Lexicon and Context in Feminization in Russian|journal=Russian Linguistics|volume=30|pages=175–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German ===
''Man'' is commonly used to mean 'one' and is frequently used in general statements. It is similar to English indefinite "you" or "one."
Feminine job titles are usually created by adding -in to the grammatically masculine word in question. Informatiker (singular or plural). The feminine form is Informatikerin (singular) and Informatikerinnen (plural).

'''Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire''' was a [[politico]]-[[economic]] system of relationships between [[liege lord]]s and enfeoffed [[vassal]]s (or feudatories) that formed the basis of the [[social structure]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[High Middle Ages]]. In German the system is variously referred to ''Lehnswesen'', ''Feudalwesen'' or ''Benefizialwesen''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Feudalism in Europe emerged in the Early Middle Ages, based on [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Roman clientship]] and the [[Germanic peoples#Culture|Germanic social hierarchy]] of lords and retainers.  It obliged the [[feudatory]] to render personal services to the lord. These included e.&amp;nbsp;g. holding his stirrup, joining him on festive occasions and service as a [[cupbearer]] at the banquet table. Both pledged mutual [[loyalty]]: the lord to "shelter and protect", the vassal to "help and advise". Furthermore, feudal lord and vassal were bound to mutually respect one another, i.e. the lord could not, by law, beat his vassal, humiliate or lay hands on his wife or daughter.&lt;!-- German Wikipedia has "daughter" not "children"; presumably this refers to protection from sexist behaviour or sexual predation. --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The highest liege lord was the sovereign, the [[king]] or [[duke]], who granted [[fief]]s to his [[prince]]s. In turn, they could award fiefs to other [[nobility|nobles]], who wanted to be [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] by them and who were often subordinate to the liege lord in the aristocratic hierarchy.

== Terms ==
[[File:Lehensurkunde Götz von Berlichingen Burg Hornberg.jpg|thumb|[[Götz von Berlichingen]] was enfeoffed with [[Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern)|Hornberg Castle]] in this deed]]
A [[fief]] (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, '''''{{lang-de|Lehen}}''''', {{lang-lat|feudum}}, ''feodum'' or ''beneficium'') was understood to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (''Lehnsherr''), had transferred to the hereditary [[ownership]] of the beneficiary on the basis of mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.

Enfeoffment gave the vassal extensive, hereditary [[usufruct]] of the fief, founded and maintained on a relationship of mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary. The Latin word ''beneficum'' implied, not only the actual estate or property, the fief - in Latin usually called the ''feodum'' - but also the associated legal relationship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The owner was the so-called liege lord or feudal lord (German: '''''Lehnsherr''''' ''Lehnsgeber''; Latin: ''[[Dominium|dominus]] feudi'', ''senior''), who was usually the [[territorial lord]] or reigning monarch. The beneficiary was his vassal, liegeman or feudatory (German: '''''Vasall''''', ''[[Lehnsmann]]'', ''[[Knecht]]'', ''Lehenempfänger'' or ''Lehensträger''; Latin: ''vassus'' or ''vasallus''). Both parties swore an [[oath of fealty]] ('''''[[Lehnseid]]''''') to one another. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (''[[dominium utile]]''), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (''[[dominium directum]]'').

The fief (German: ''Lehen'' or '''''Lehnsgut''''') usually comprised an estate or a complex of estates, but also specified rights of use and rights of taxation or duties.

Linguistically the term ''Lehen'' is connected with the word ''leihen'', to lend or loan, and meant something like "loaned property" (c.f. the modern German ''Darlehen'', a loan), whilst the word ''feudum'', which some etymologists suggest comes from the Latin ''fides'' (loyalty), is more likely to be derived from the [[Old High German]] ''feo'', which meant ''Vieh'' i.e. "cattle", but later generally meant "goods" or "property".

The opposite of a fief was the freehold, [[allod]] or ''allodium'', which roughly corresponds to the present freehold estate.

An institution during the transition from feudal states to what is now the free ownership of property, was the ''allodifizierte Lehen'' ("allodified fief"), a fief in which the feudal lord gave up direct ownership - usually in  return for the payment of compensation or an allodified rent (''Allodifikationsrenten'') - but the vassal's ownership of the fief with an agreed agnatic succession - resembling a family [[entailed estate]] (''Familienfideikommiß'') - remained in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Types ===
There were numerous different types of feudal arrangement depending on regional tradition and the nature of feudal lordship (secular or ecclesiastical/monastic). The best-known of these were:

* '''''[[Afterlehen]]:''''' A [[mesne]] fief whereby the vassal awarded (parts of) his fief to a third party
* '''''Altarlehen:''''' A medieval proto-foundation (''proto-Stiftung'').  Its purpose was to allocate annual revenue from the property to a specific primate for his abbey or church
* '''''Beutellehen:''''' originally a ''Ritterlehen'' that was later rented to farmers
* '''''[[Burglehn]]:''''' a fief in payment for services as a [[castellan]] (''[[Burgmann]]'')
* '''''Erblehen:''''' a fief where the heirs of the vassal automatically inherited his rights and duties. The fief only first became hereditary through the conferral of a letter of hereditary right (''Erbrechtsbrief'') from the liege lord
* '''''Fahnlehen:''''' ("banner fief"&lt;ref name="Stieber"&gt;Stieber, Joachim. W. (1978). ''Pope Eugenius IV, the Council of Basel and the Secular and Ecclesiastical Authorities in the Empire'', E.J. Brill, Leiden, p. 124. {{ISBN|90-04-05240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a fief to a secular prince, in which banners symbolised the fief and the duties to the [[Heerbann]].
* '''''Falllehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. See ''Schupflehen''
* '''''Freistift:''''' a fief that could be cancelled at 12 months notice
* '''''Handlehen:''''' a fief awarded for a specified period or the life of the vassal. Originally: a fief sealed by a handshake instead of a formal oath of fealty.
* '''''Kunkellehen:'''''  a fief to a vassal who was a woman (also called a ''Weiberlehen'' or ''feudum femininum'')
* '''''Mannlehen/Mannslehen:''''' a fief to a vassal who had to be a man
* '''''ligisches Lehnswesen:''''' a fief in which the vassal was excluded from holding fiefs from other lords through a stronger contract between lord and vassal
* '''''Schildlehen:''''' similar to ''Fahnenlehen'', but where the vassal held the rank of count or lower
* '''''Schupflehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. His heirs were figuratively seen as "pushed" (Old German/Alemannic: ''geschupft'') out of the contract
* '''''Stiftslehen:''''' the fief was granted by an abbey, also called a ''Klosterlehen'' 
* '''''Weiberlehen:''''' see ''Kunkellehen''
* '''''Zepterlehen:''''' a fief to an ecclesiastical prince

== Feudal system ==
The king gave estates or appointments (''Ämter'') to upper or crown vassals (''Kronvasallen''), who, in turn, passed them on to lower vassals (''Untervasallen''). The lower vassals would then hire the land to be cultivated by unfree farmers. There were no feudal relationships between farmers and the lower vassals.

During the Middle Ages another structure developed in Germany, the so-called ''[[Heerschild]]ordnung'', a medieval feudal hierarchy:

* King (''König'')
* Ecclesiastical princes (''Geistliche Fürsten'')
* Secular, or lay, princes (''Weltliche Fürsten'')
* Counts and barons (''Grafen und Freiherren'')
* [[Ministeriales]] (''Ministerialen'' or ''Dienstmannen'')
* Vassals of the ministeriales (''Männer der Ministerialen'')
* Free knights (''Ritterbürtige Mannen'') (who could only receive a fief, not grant one)

Initially, only those of knightly birth were entitled to be enfeoffed, i.e. free knights who could bear arms and were in full possession of their title. Later, unfree ministeriales also rose to the knighthood. Vassalage consisted mainly of military campaigns (military service) and court duty (the presence of vassals at the court in order to offer advice). From court service, the state and imperial diets emerged. The fief was only given to the vassal to utilize; later, the vassal also became a sub-owner, but the feudal lord always retained the rights to this office. Eventually, the heritability of fiefs evolved later, but the landowner nevertheless remain the liege lord.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Roots of feudalism ==

=== Roman patronage ===
{{main|Patronage in ancient Rome}}

In [[Late Antiquity]], out of the Roman system of patronage (or clientage) and the clan (''[[Sippe]]'') relationships of the [[Migration Period]] (''Völkerwanderungszeit'') (Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil), relations between rulers and their subjects developed into a prevailing consensus that was commonplace and accepted.

In Roman culture, it was common for a patron (a wealthy Roman citizen) to automatically retain his freed [[slave]]s in a dependent relationship, known as patronage. In some cases, populations of conquered areas would become clients of the general who conquered the area. This required the client to accompany his patron to war and protect him if the latter so wished, to accompany him to court as a vocal supporter and, if the patron held public office, to act as his assistant and to accompany him on representational events in public.

In return, the patron had to ensure the legal and practical support of his client in all aspects of life. A Roman citizen, a non-Roman and even entire tribes in the Roman Empire could have a patron-client relationship.

In Late Antiquity, this form of relationship was increasingly adopted in rural areas, because the Roman nomenklatura increasingly saw their vast estates (''[[Latifundia]]'') as their refuge and also as economically important pillars, over which they sometimes even had their own jurisdiction and fortified prisons.
 
Clients at that time were usually bound to their patrons through the allocation of land.

=== Germanic clan system ===
During the latter years of the period of [[Sippe|clan society]] with Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil, it was common for all the land to belong to the [[king]]. Only he could distribute land to his subjects. These subjects were usually family members, warriors who had performed outstanding feats, and noblemen. This land did not become the property of the subject, but was handed over to him only ''in persona''. On the death of king or vassal, the land was [[de facto]] returned to the new king. Over time, a practice developed that the person [[enfeoffed]] with the land, together with his family, became the beneficiaries of the [[fief]] and remained permanently bound to it. Upon the death of one party, a new act of homage (''Lehnseid''), a formal legal ceremony, had to take place. These transitions were fluid and there were exceptions to the practice of [[enfeoffment]].

The vassal often enfeoffed the estate, usually divided into smaller parcels of land, to other lesser vassals, who in turn had to swear fealty to him. In return for the lease of land, the king could demand loyalty and allegiance from the vassal and his sub-vassals. This means that, in the event of war, they had to provide soldiers and assistance, or if money ran short or a ransom was needed, they were expected to support the king.

The Roman patron-client relationship and the early clan-based feudal relationship in the Germanic kingdoms merged during the early Middle Ages into the feudal law, or ''Lehnsrecht'', a legal and social set of relationships, which effectively formed a pyramid with the king at the top.

The enforcement of ''Lehnsrecht'' is associated with the reduced circulation of money in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods. [[Money]] could not bind a [[vassal]] to a king, only land. Unlike money, this was plentiful.

Even kings (see [[Richard the Lionheart]] - compulsory allegiance) and at least in the early Middle Ages, the [[clergy]] (see [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]]-[[Salian dynasty|Salian]] [[imperial church]] system) could be vassals of a king or another king.

=== Emergence of feudal relationships ===
[[File:Lehnseid.png|thumb|Acceptain of the oath of fealty (''Lehnseid'') in 1512]]
Under the feudal system, various legal institutions came together during the [[Carolingian period]] that had previously existed independently. These institutions were:
* The ''antrustiones'' - these were the inner circle of the king's retinue; they were distinguished by the fact that a multiple of the usual [[weregild]] had to be paid to them.
* The ''vassi'' - free lords who could no longer look after for themselves were able to [[commend]] themselves into the hands of a more powerful lord, receiving sustenance and shelter in return for an obligation of loyalty and service. They did not lose their status as free lords through the [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]] ceremony, but the royal court continued to be responsible for them. The commendation was enacted by the so-called ''handgang'' ceremony, i.e. the future ''vassus'' put his hands, folded, into the hands of his lord, who then enclosed them. This gesture made the relationship of the two very clear.
* The ''beneficium'' (original meaning of "benefit") - in the early Middle Ages land was leased, but there were also cases where estates were granted without requiring recompense, for example under duress or to do someone a favour. The lord then remained the true owner of the land, but was no longer its beneficiary.

It was from the combination of these institutions, especially as more and more lords achieved high social position, that the feudal system emerged.
The ''handgang'', which together with the oath of loyalty (''Treueid''), became referred to as ''homagium'' (Latin), ''homage'' (French), or ''mannschaft'' (German), became the decisive legal device until well into the 12th century. Not until the spread of the system of legal deeds was the ''handgang'' dropped from the oath of allegiance, which was better recorded in writing.

[[Commendation ceremony|Commendation]]s were still carried out at all levels. In lower classes they were based on the [[manorial]] system (''Grundherrschaft''), at the high levels on feudalism (''Lehnswesen'').

The award of fiefs often replaced the remuneration for work. This was necessary because the [[monetary system]] necessary to make regular payments was still far too underdeveloped during the early Middle Ages.

=== Subsequent development ===
As the services of the vassal specifically included military service, under the Frankish monarchy the feudal system was for centuries the basis of the army as well as the social organization of the Holy Roman Empire. &lt;!-- (see [[Personenverbandsstaat]]) --&gt;

It was not only the king who acquired vassals in this way. He was soon imitated by secular and ecclesiastical magnates. Gradually, the principle of the heritability of fiefs was established along with the admissibility of passing them on as ''Afterlehen'' to sub-vassals. The latter were also declared as heritable in 1037 by [[Conrad II (HRR)|Conrad II]] in the ''[[constitutio de feudis]]''. So it came to pass that as early as the 12th century, all duchies and counties were awarded as fiefs.

Within each of these ecclesiastical and secular territories, however, there was a variety of types of feudalism. Not until the 13th century, did the importance of the feudal system decline, because instead of vassals (''Vassallen''), liegemen (''Dienstmannen'') - well-educated men (c.f. the development of the [[university]] system) - were appointed. The kings encouraged this development, for political reasons, and so strengthened [[territorial lordship]] (''Landesherrschaft''), which replaced the feudal system empire-wide. This strengthening of territorial rulers had an impact that could not be reversed, so that the power of the various principalities did not reduce, unlike the situation in France and England.

In England, feudal ties were abolished as early as the Revolution of 1649, and then by an express decree by Charles II in 1660. In France they were abolished by the decisions of the National Assembly on 4 and 5 August 1789. In Germany, the dissolution of feudal associations (''Lehnsverband'') was a long process. Legally, it was abolished ''inter alia'' by the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] acts, in the [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation]] and the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849. One of the last fiefs was awarded in 1835, when the ailing Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlitz, known as Görtz, was enfeoffed with the spring at [[Bad Salzschlirf|Salzschlirf]] and began to excavate it again. Those fiefs still in existence in the 20th century were abolished in 1947 by an [[Allied Control Council]] edict.

== Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire ==
In general, the vassal (''Lehnsmann'') was granted land or [[Freihaus|free houses]] (''Freihäuser'') in return for his services. He could also provide services at the lord's residence and be accommodated there.  Most of these so-called ''servi non cassati'' were given a fief as soon as one became available.

Official positions (''Ämter'') and sovereign rights over a particular territory (feudal [[regalia]]) could be awarded as a fief. It was in this way that the [[House of Thurn and Taxis]] received its '''''Postlehen''''' or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (''[[Stift]]e'' or ''feudal ecclesiastica'') and enfeoffments of [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]]s associated with an [[altar]] (''feudum altaragli''). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.

=== Feoffment ===
Feoffment (''constitutio feudi, infeudatio'') involved the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a [[commendation ceremony]]. In Frankish times, commendation centered around the so-called handclasping ceremony (''Handgang''):  the vassal clasped his hands together and placed them in the hands of his lord, who then clasped his hands around those of his vassal. He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an [[oath of allegiance]], which was usually sworn on a religious [[relic]]. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.

In the 11th century, the commendation ceremony required the liegeman to pay homage (''homagium'' or ''Mannschaft''), which involved the handclasping ceremony as well as a declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as [[livery of seizin]] and could be a staff or a banner (called a ''Fahnenlehn''). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called ''Zepterlehen''). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the feoffed estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.

In the late Middle Ages, an entry fee was demanded for feoffment, which was often based on the fief's annual income.

The fief (benefice) that the vassal received could be owned by the lord or have been granted in fee by another. Sometimes the vassal even sold or gifted over his possessions to the lord (''Lehnsauftragung'') and then received it back as a fief ([[Oblation (legal)|''oblatio feudi'']]). This was usually done in the hope that the liege lord could defend his estate better in the event of a dispute in the field or at court. The lord purchased or accepted the gift because he might have the intention or hope, for example, of merging unrelated fiefdoms into a whole and thus extending his sphere of influence, for example, in terms of jurisdiction, or the appointment of clergy.

=== Legal relationship between lords and vassals ===
From the 11th century, the obligations of vassals were usually described as ''auxilium et consilium'' (help and advice). ''Auxilium'' usually implied assistance in terms of military service that the vassal had to render. This could be unlimited, i.e. the vassal had to assist his lord in every conflict, or it could be limited in time, space and in the number of troops to be raised. With the advent of the mercenaries, the reliance on vassals became less important and their service increasingly took the form of administration and court duties. ''Consilium'' meant primarily the obligation to appear at imperial assemblies or ''[[Hoftag]]e''. Vassals whose feudal lord was not the king took part in the councils of their liege lords. They also had to administer justice over their subjects in the name of their master.

The vassal could even be required to pay money; though perhaps not to the extent of England, where military service became a requirement for war funds and the English king used the money to pay for his mercenaries. Monetary payments were also required in other cases, such as to pay a ransom for a captive lord, for the [[accolade]] of his eldest son, for the [[dowry]] of his eldest daughter, or for a journey to the [[Holy Land]].

The feudal lord could also demand recompense (''Lehnserneuerung'' or ''renovatio investiturae'') from his vassals if they lost their fief or upon changes of lord - changes of ruler at any level, local lord, prince or king (known as ''Herrenfall, Hauptfall, Thronfall'') - as well as changes of vassal (known as ''Lehnsfall, Vasallenfall'' or ''Mannfall, Nebenfall''). The latter had to submit a written application (''Lehnsmutung'') within a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]] (actually 1 year, 6 weeks, 3 days) and ask for the renewal of his investiture, but this term could be extended by a decree from the lord (''Lehnsindult'').

Depending on [[local law]], the vassal might be liable, apart from the fee, for the renewal of the enfeoffment (called the ''Schreibschilling'' or ''Lehnstaxe''), to pay a special tax (the ''Laudemium, Lehnsgeld, Lehnsware'' or ''Handlohn''). Finally, in the event of a [[felony]] by the vassal, the lord could confiscate the fief under the so-called ''Privationsklage'' action or step in to prevent the deterioration of the estate, if necessary, by legal means. He could also assert his claim to ownership at any time against any unauthorized third parties.

The duties of the lords were less precisely defined, however, they were largely discharged on the handover of the fief. The vassal always had a claim to loyalty from his lord (''Lehnsprotektion'') and a breach of that by the lord meant the loss of his sovereignty over his vassal. The vassal had the "right of use" of the fief (the object of enfeoffment or  ''Lehnsobjekt''). The lord also had to represent his vassals in court.

=== Dissolution of a feudal relationship ===
Originally, a lord-vassal tie (''Lehnsbindung'') was a lifelong, faithful relationship that could end only on death. It was also inconceivable that someone could be the vassal of more than one lord. In fact, multiple vassalage soon emerged and loosened the duty of loyalty for the liegeman (''Lehnsmann'') considerably. Also, the opportunity to inherit a fief diminished the ability of the lord to intervene and loosened the personal loyalty of liegemen. Over time, the importance of fiefdoms increased more and more, whilst the duty of loyalty faded increasingly into the background. In the end, a fief was simply an estate for which the heir had to perform a certain ceremony.

== Summary ==
In summary, the feudal system was based on two main components - the personal and the material elements.

Personal element:
The lord and vassal committed themselves to mutual loyalty. The visible expression of this commitment was the act of the vassal placing his hands in those of his lord (''handgang'' - comparable with today's handshake, except that the ''handgang'' symbolized a hierarchical relation).

Material element:
Based on the pledge of loyalty between them, the lord made land available to the vassal. The vassal was obliged, in return, to render various services and taxes.

== Family, house and place names ==
An echo of the old feudal system in Europe is found in family names such as [[Lehner]], Lechner, Lehmann, Lehle, Horrigan and Lenherr as well as in numerous house and even place names, that even today have the term ''Lehen'' in the names (see a list at [[Lehen (disambiguation)]]).

[[File:It's OK to be white.jpg|right|thumb|An "It's OK to be white" sticker]]
'''It's okay to be white'''&lt;ref name="adl" /&gt; or '''It's OK to be white''' ('''IOTBW''') is a slogan based on a poster campaign organized on the American [[imageboard]] [[4chan]] in 2017, as a "proof of concept" that a "harmless message" would cause a media backlash.&lt;ref name="McGladrey2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625104237/http://www.cfweradio.ca/on-air/blogs/dustin-mcgladrey/post/its-okay-to-be-white-was-a-planned-hate-crime-from-4chan-internet-trolls/|title="It's Okay To Be White" Was A Planned Hate Crime From 4chan Internet Trolls|last=McGladrey|first=Dustin|date=November 1, 2017|accessdate=June 25, 2018|work=[[CFWE-FM]]|publisher=[[Aboriginal Multi-Media Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; Posters and stickers containing the sentence "It's okay to be white" have been placed in streets in the United States as well as on campuses in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/11/03/its-okay-to-be-white-signs-and-stickers-appear-on-campuses-and-streets-across-the-country/|title='It's okay to be white' signs and stickers appear on campuses and streets across the country|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan has been spread by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and racist groups including [[neo-Nazi]]s and [[white supremacist]]s.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt;

==Background==
The suggestion for the use of posters with the saying originated on the message board [[4chan]] with the intent of provoking reactions. The saying was later spread by [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups and politically organized racists, including former [[Ku Klux Klan]] Grand Wizard [[David Duke]] and ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/neo-nazi-david-duke-backed-meme-was-reported-tucker-carlson-without-context-714655|title=The 'It's Okay to Be White' meme was backed by neo-Nazis and David Duke|date=November 19, 2017|website=newsweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] states that the phrase itself has a history within the white supremacist movement going back to 2001 when it was used as the title of a song by a [[white power music]] group called Aggressive Force as well as fliers with the phrase being spotted in 2005 and the slogan being used by a member of the [[United Klans of America]].&lt;ref name=adl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/blog/from-4chan-another-trolling-campaign-emerges|title=From 4Chan, Another Trolling Campaign Emerges|website=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the flyers were torn down and some accused the posters of being [[covertly racist]],&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbknews.com/2017/11/07/white-supremacy-its-okay-to-be-white-posters-umd-montgomery-blair-high-school-racism/|title='It’s okay to be white' posters are covertly racist|date=November 6, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, like Jeff Guillory, executive director of [[Washington State University]]'s Office of Equity and Diversity, argued that there was nothing offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/nov/30/its-okay-to-be-white-posters-spark-mixed-responses/|title=‘It’s okay to be white’ posters spark mixed responses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/29/conservative-lucian-wintrich-arrested-at-uconn-speech-titled-its-ok-to-be-white.html|title=Conservative boy wonder Lucian Wintrich arrested at UConn speech titled, 'It's OK to be White'|date=November 29, 2017|work=Fox News|access-date=January 27, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
The [[University of Regina]] declared the posters "divisive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontosun.com/news/national/its-ok-to-be-white-posters-too-divisive-for-regina-university-could-be-considered-vandalism|title='It's OK To Be White' posters too 'divisive' for Regina University, could be considered vandalism|date=November 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/university-of-regina-is-removing-its-okay-to-be-white-posters-from-campus|title=University of Regina is removing It's OKAY To Be White posters from campus|date=November 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; University President [[Vianne Timmons]] said: "Simply put, these signs have no place at our university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/it-s-okay-to-be-white-poster-pops-up-at-u-of-r-security-investigating-1.4415514|title='It's okay to be white' posters pop up at U of R; security investigating|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for a [[Waterloo Region District School Board]] commented: "Our schools are [[safe space]]s. We want to see them be safe for all of our children, so to see this kind of thing emerge is a worry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/it-s-okay-to-be-white-signs-posted-outside-schools-1.3666093|title='It's okay to be white' signs posted outside schools|date=November 6, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signs were found at [[Washington State University]], Phil Weiler, Vice President of University Communications, said that "one could reasonably believe the intention of the signs is to set a sense of fear and intimidation on campus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='It's ok to be white' signs found on WSU campus|url=http://www.king5.com/news/its-ok-to-be-white-signs-found-on-wsu-campus/495719052|accessdate=December 1, 2017|publisher=KREM-TV|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive director of Washington State University's Office of Equity and Diversity responded to the posters by saying: "In my mind, it's a nonthreatening statement", further stating: "Sure, it's OK to be white. It's OK to be African-American. It's OK to be Latino. It's OK to be gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nadauld|first1=Taylor|title='It's okay to be white' posters spark mixed responses|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/nov/30/its-okay-to-be-white-posters-spark-mixed-responses/|accessdate=December 1, 2017|publisher=The Spokesman-Review|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Utah]] said: "If, indeed, these tactics are meant to silence our work in diversity and inclusion, please know we shall not be deterred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.studyinternational.com/news/ok-to-be-white/|title=US: University fights back against 'It's OK To Be White' posters on campus|date=November 7, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota)|Concordia College]] said that their President was planning a meeting where students could "discuss the matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/11/04/its-ok-to-be-white-signs-put-up-at-concordia-college-in-moorhead/|title='It's OK to be white' signs put up at Concordia College in Moorhead|date=November 4, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police were contacted regarding the flyers being posted at [[University of California, Berkeley]]. A police department spokesperson said "the signs did not constitute a [[hate crime]] because they did not target a specific race and because no criminal act was committed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=Bradford|title='It's OK to be white'  campaign rankles higher education|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/10/its-ok-be-white-campaign-rankles-higher-education/|accessdate=November 10, 2017|publisher=The Washington Times|date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Upwelling|first1=Elise|title='It's Okay to be White' posters found at UC Berkeley|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2017/11/07/okay-white-posters-found-uc-berkeley/|accessdate=November 10, 2017|publisher=The Daily Californian|date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[Lucian Wintrich]] attempted to give a speech titled "It's OK To Be White" at [[University of Connecticut]] as an invited speaker of the school's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] club. The speech was protested and came to an end when a protester, employed as the director of career services at [[Quinebaug Valley Community College]],&lt;ref name="BBCcharged"/&gt; grabbed Wintrich's speech papers from the podium and Wintrich grabbed her, resulting in [[breach of peace]] charges against Wintrich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colli|first1=George|title=Conservative speaker arrested at UConn blames university security, protesters|url=http://wtnh.com/2017/11/29/conservative-speaker-arrested-at-uconn-blames-students/|accessdate=December 5, 2017|publisher=News 8|date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, the charges against Wintrich were dropped and the woman who took the papers was charged with attempted sixth-degree [[larceny]] and [[disorderly conduct]]. She stated through her attorney she took Wintrich's speech as a form of protest, describing Wintrich's "It's OK To Be White" speech as "hateful language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rondinone|first1=Nicholas|title=Quinebaug College Adviser Charged After Lucian Wintrich's UConn Event|url=http://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-br-catherine-gregory-lucian-wintrich-uconn-event-arrest-20171211-story.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=Hartfort Courant|date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCcharged"&gt;{{cite news|title=US woman charged for stealing 'OK to be white' speech|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42313641|accessdate=December 17, 2017|publisher=BBC|date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
While some media sources reacted in the way the original authors on 4chan had expected,&lt;ref name="clevescene"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2017/11/01/4chan-troll-movement-hits-rocky-river-with-its-ok-to-be-white-signs|author=Eric Sandy|title=4chan Troll Movement Hits Rocky River with 'It's OK To Be White' Signs &amp;#124; Scene and Heard: Scene's News Blog|website=clevescene.com|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; others like [[TheBlaze]] described the campaign as [[trolling]], or a prank.&lt;ref name="theblaze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/04/maryland-high-school-investigating-flyers-with-simple-5-word-message-about-white-people/|title=Maryland High School investigating flyers with simple 5-word message about white people|website=TheBlaze|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tucker Carlson]] on [[Fox News]] defended the campaign in a segment entitled "High school Fliers Create Shock and Horror". Carlson asked: "What’s the correct position? That it’s not okay to be white?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/11/03/tucker-carlson-defends-4chans-its-okay-be-white-campaign/218454|title=Tucker Carlson defends 4chan's "it's okay to be white" campaign|date=November 3, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghYmmrKCx_s|title=Tucker Carlson "Is It Okay To Be White"?|first=|last=Very Fake News|date=November 4, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Michael Hayden said Carlson was helping to spread neo-Nazi propaganda by defending the posters, saying the slogan is being promoted by [[neo-Nazis]] and [[white supremacists]].&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Janell Ross commented on the poster campaign saying "the white victim construct is one that experts say, not so long ago, only had traction in avowed white supremacists, segregationists and neo-Nazi circles. But today, it animates open and anonymous public discussions of race and shapes the nation’s politics."&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt; ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'' compared it with the children's book ''[[It's Okay To Be Different]]'' and said, "but white folks have taken that beautiful sentiment and distorted it to suit their infinite need to center themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/it-s-okay-to-be-white-signs-papered-all-over-the-coun-1820156469|title='It's Okay to Be White' Signs Papered All Over the Country Because Everyone Knows White People Are Oppressed|first=Angela|last=Helm|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online magazine ''Jacobite'' argued that the goal of the meme was to trick certain [[political progressives]] into attacking an "anodyne" message and thus elicit a "second-order reaction" from outsiders perplexed by the idea that the concept of being white is somehow unacceptable, instead of ignoring the message. The writer claims that the meme attempts to exploit its progressive opponents psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Nathan |title=THE ASYMMETRIC MEME WARFARE OF "IT’S OK TO BE WHITE" |url=https://jacobitemag.com/2017/11/17/the-asymmetric-meme-warfare-of-its-ok-to-be-white/ |website=Jacobite |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] columnist Jason Wilson argued that "It's OK To Be White" was devised by white supremacists in order to stoke overreaction from the left, sow confusion, embed a racist agenda in the mainstream media, and ultimately invite a backlash against anti-racist activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/its-ok-to-be-white-is-not-a-joke-its-careless-politicians-helping-the-far-right|title=‘It’s OK to be white’ is not a joke, it’s careless politicians helping the far right {{!}} Jason Wilson|last=Wilson|first=Jason|date=2018-10-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other media===
According to ''[[ThinkProgress]]'', T-shirts with the slogan were put on sale at [[Shopify]] by [[Milo Yiannopoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/milo-shirt-shopify-1cd8ca659046/|title=Shopify is helping monetize the latest white nationalist meme|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Markus Persson]], founder of [[Mojang]], tweeted the phrase on November 30, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Judge|first1=Monique|title=‘Minecraft’&amp;nbsp;Creator Goes Full White Man Denying White Privilege on Twitter|url=https://www.theroot.com/minecraft-creator-goes-full-white-privilege-denying-whi-1820904201|website=The Root|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Persson|first1=Markus|title=It's ok to be white.|url=https://twitter.com/notch/status/936215345400033280|website=Twitter|accessdate=December 2, 2017|language=en|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian parliament motion===
On October 15, 2018, right-wing politician [[Pauline Hanson]] proposed an "It's OK to be white" motion in the [[Australian Senate]] intended to acknowledge the "deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on Western civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bourke |first1=Latika |title=Coalition backs Pauline Hanson's 'It's OK to be white' motion |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/coalition-backs-pauline-hanson-s-it-s-ok-to-be-white-motion-20181015-p509tw.html |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supported by most senators from the governing [[Coalition_(Australia)|Liberal-National Coalition]], but was defeated 31-28 by opponents who called it a racist slogan from the white supremacist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pauline Hanson says 'it's OK to be white' |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pauline-hanson-says-it-s-ok-to-be-white |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=SBS News |agency=AAP |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Paul |title='OK to be white': Australian government senators condemn 'anti-white racism' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/15/ok-to-be-white-australian-government-senators-condemn-anti-white-racism |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the motion was brought up again and rejected unanimously by senators in attendance, with its initial supporters saying they had voted for it due to an administrative error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/australian-senators-inadvertently-back-far-right-motion-saying-its-ok-to-be-white|title=Australian senators say error led to backing far-right motion saying 'it's OK to be white'|date=October 16, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science.

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used. American "[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]" happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]] and occupies the [[center-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, a divide between conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals persists. On the other hand, in those countries where liberal conservative movements have more recently entered the political mainstream, such as Italy and Spain, the terms "liberal" and "conservative" may be understood as synonymous. Often this involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to traditional [[centre-right politics]], such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" – now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] – advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] – without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Michael |title='Liberal?

The idea of language as a 'system' appears in the linguistic theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[J.R. Firth]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Michael Halliday]].

The paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='System' in systemic functional linguistics==
“System” is used in two related ways in [[systemic functional linguistics]] (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from [[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]] &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, [[Jay Lemke]] describes language as an open, dynamic system.

There is also the notion of “system” as used by [[John Rupert Firth|J.R. Firth]], where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In "Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers" from the ''Ninth International Systemic Workshop'', James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a “Science of Language”. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp1-9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of [[complex systems]].

[[Transport]] today is mostly powered by fossil fuel.  The reason for this is the ease of use and the existence of mature technologies harnessing this fuel source.  Fossil fuels represent a concentrated, relatively compact [[Energy development|source of energy]].  The drawbacks are that they are heavily polluting and rely on limited natural resources.  There are many proposals to harness renewable forms of energy, to use fossil fuel more efficiently, or to use human power, or some hybrid of these, to move people and things.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">The '''Lwów–Warsaw school''' ({{lang-pl|Szkoła lwowsko-warszawska}}) was a Polish [[school of thought]] founded by [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] in 1895 in [[Lemberg]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]).

Although the members represented a variety of disciplines, from [[mathematics]] through [[logic]] to [[psychology]], the School is widely considered to have been a philosophical movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Woleński]], ''Filozoficzna szkoła lwowsko-warszawska'', Warsaw, [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]], 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in the 1920s and 1930s, the school's work was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Despite this, the members went on and fundamentally influenced modern science, notably mathematics and logic, in the post-war period. The most prominent member of this school, [[Alfred Tarski]], has been ranked as one of the four greatest logicians of all time—along with [[Aristotle]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaught"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|publisher=ASL|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869–882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Restall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002–2006|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Polish science, the philosopher [[Jan Woleński]] considers himself close to the heritage of the school. In 2013 Woleński was awarded by the [[Foundation for Polish Science]] for a comprehensive analysis of the work of the Lwów–Warsaw school and for placing its achievements within the international discourse of contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnp.org.pl/en/prof-dr-hab-jan-wolenski-laureat-nagrody-fnp-2013/|title=Prof. Jan Woleński, PhD hab. – FNP Prize 2013 laureate|accessdate=2016-08-11| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319165243/http://www.fnp.org.pl/en/prof-dr-hab-jan-wolenski-laureat-nagrody-fnp-2013/| archivedate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kazimierz Twardowski 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kazimierz Twardowski]], 1933]]
The Lwów–Warsaw school of logic lay at the origin of [[Polish logic]] and was closely associated with the [[Warsaw school of mathematics]]. It began as a more general philosophical school but steadily moved toward logic. In the 1930s Alfred Tarski initiated contacts with the [[Vienna Circle]]. In addition to Brentano, his pupils [[Anton Marty]], [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] also considerably influenced Polish philosophy and the Lwów–Warsaw school.

Principal topics of interest to that school included formal [[ontology]], [[mereology]], and universal or [[categorial grammar]].

Instituted in 1933, they were offered to newlywed couples in the form of vouchers for household goods, initially on condition that the woman stopped working. Unless the husband's earnings were very low, interest rates on the loans continued to be lower if only he worked; and one quarter of the principal was forgiven for each child.

Marriage loans were created by the "Law for the Reduction of Unemployment" of June 1, 1933.&lt;ref name=Alltag63&gt;Klaus-Jörg Ruhl, ''Brauner Alltag: 1933&amp;ndash;1939 in Deutschland'', Fotografierte Zeitgeschichte, Düsseldorf: Droste, 1981, {{ISBN|978-3-7700-0585-7}}, p. 63 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vokabular161&gt;Cornelia Schmitz-Berning, ''Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus'', Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-11-013379-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jmWOMks6bkC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQeT8uIJoz9iQKLh_3RCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehestandsdarlehen&amp;f=false p. 161] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nordic race|Aryan]] newylyweds were eligible to receive an interest-free loan of 1,000 [[Reichsmark]]s,&lt;ref name=Alltag63/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grunberger235&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''A Social History of the Third Reich'', London: Weidenfeld, 1971, {{ISBN|9780297002949}}, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of vouchers in the husband's name that could be redeemed for household goods such as furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Stibbe, ''Women in the Third Reich'', London: Arnold / New York: Oxford University, {{ISBN|978-0-340-76105-2}}, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount was approximately one fifth of average annual take-home pay;&lt;ref name=Stibbe40&gt;Stibbe, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; industrial workers earned 140 RM a month.&lt;ref name=Alltag64&gt;Ruhl, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the loans required that the bride stop work immediately&lt;ref name=Alltag63/&gt; and not take another position during the life of the loan unless the husband was earning less than 125&amp;nbsp;RM per month.&lt;ref name=Vokabular161/&gt; Planners hoped that the loan programme would cause 800,000 women to leave the workforce over the first four years, and there was an associated programme of subsidies for household goods manufacture intended to provide jobs for another 200,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schoenbaum]], ''Hitler's Social Revolution: Class and Status in Nazi Germany 1933&amp;ndash;1939'', 1966, repr. New York/London: Norton, 1980, {{OCLC|173223624}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1933, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' featured as a "shining" example the mass wedding and subsequent resignations of 122 female employees of the [[Reemtsma]] cigarette factory in Berlin, who thereby freed jobs for unemployed men.&lt;ref name=Stibbe41&gt;Stibbe, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, full employment had been achieved and women workers were needed, so the requirement was removed and the loan made available to all young people of documented Aryan ancestry and genetic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhl, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an increase in applications: by 1936 approximately one third of couples were receiving them; by 1939 this had risen to 42%.&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1938, a special marriage loan programme for agricultural workers was added as part of the Decree on the Welfare of the Rural Population: couples were eligible if one partner had worked in agriculture or forestry for five years before they married, and the loan would be excused after a further ten years of such work. There was also a renewable 400&amp;nbsp;RM subsidy to farm workers for setting up a household.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying for the loans required demonstrating ancestral and medical "fitness," which could be onerous.&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a law of August 31, 1939 suspended the documentary requirements in anticipation of the effects of the war.&lt;ref name=Vokabular161/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Couples who were both employed had to pay back the loan at the rate of 3% per month; if only the husband was employed, the repayment rate was 1% a month.&lt;ref name=Grunberger235/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt; In accordance with the Nazi policy of reversing the decline in the birth rate among Germans, one quarter of the loan was forgiven for each child, so that with the fourth child, no more was owed.&lt;ref name=Grunberger235/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stibbe41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhl, pp. 62&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the colloquialism ''abkindern'' (from ''ab'', off, and ''Kind'', child) for discharging the loan by producing offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Zentner and Friedemann Bedürftig, tr.

By the end of 1938, 1,121,000 marriage loans had been extended, 800,000 under the original conditions of requiring the bride to stop work, and a "baby boom" had resulted in the forgiveness of 980,000.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger, pp. 235, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was then halved, to 500 RM.&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt;  The 250 RM for each child remained a powerful incentive; other financial assistance, called ''Kindergeld'', was also available to encourage families to have children.&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt; The loans were a particularly strong incentive to marry after extramarital pregnancy had occurred.&lt;ref name=Grunberger235/&gt;

The loans were partially paid for by a tax on unmarried people called ''Ehestandshilfe'' (marriage assistance, fund for the aid of marriage).&lt;ref&gt;Zentner and Bedürftig, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=16IdT8arC6jSiALVmay-CA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=crRZAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+Third+Reich&amp;q=Ehestandshilfe#search_anchor p. 574].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard Bancroft Clough, Thomas Moodie and Carol Moodie, eds., ''Economic History of Europe: Twentieth Century'', Documentary history of Western civilization, New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1968, {{OCLC|463948695}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x7YrAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Ehestandshilfe&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQeT8uIJoz9iQKLh_3RCw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg p. 254].&lt;/ref&gt; This was levied at a rate of 2&amp;ndash;5% of gross annual income on those under 55 who were liable for income tax; under a law of October 16, 1934, it was incorporated into the income tax beginning in January 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz-Berning, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jmWOMks6bkC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQeT8uIJoz9iQKLh_3RCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehestandshilfe&amp;f=false p. 122].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hartmannsgruber, ''Die Regierung Hitler'' volume 3 ''1936'', Munich: Oldenbourg, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-7646-1839-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=4y4eT4utCJLMiQKh0PX9Cw&amp;id=7OJVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;q=Die+Mittel+dazu+werden+aus+der+Ehestandshilfe+der+Ledigen9+aufgebracht%2C+die+durch+das+Einkommensteuergesetz+vom+Oktober+1934+in+die+Einkommensteuer+eingebaut+worden+ist+und+demgem%C3%A4%C3%9F+seit+1.+Januar+1935+als+erh%C3%B6hte+Einkommensteuer+der#search_anchor p. 17] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the marriage loan programme, furniture and home furnishings were amongst the few retail trade sectors to show expansion under the Third Reich; and this did not apply to department stores, which were specifically excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, pp. 134, 143 and note 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[East Germany|East German]] government forgave all outstanding marriage loans in 1950, and in 1972 instituted its own loan programme, the ''Ehekredit'' (marriage credit), which was strongly reminiscent of the Nazi marriage loan: newlyweds under 26 received an interest-free loan of 5,000 [[East German mark]]s, which was progressively forgiven as they had children (in this case 3), again referred to as ''abkindern''.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Trappe, ''Emanzipation oder Zwang?: Frauen in der DDR zwischen Beruf, Familie und Sozialpolitik'', Berlin: Akademie, 1995, {{ISBN|978-3-05-002808-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OcgQyOOtA7AC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Ehekredit+DDR&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hb0dT_TRI8mniAKqvKXNCw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehekredit%20DDR&amp;f=false p. 70] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schwartz, "Emanzipation zur sozialen Nützlichkeit: Bedingungen und Grenzen von Frauenpolitik in der DDR" in ''Sozialstaatlichkeit in der DDR: Sozialpolitische Entwicklungen im Spannungsfeld von Diktatur und Gesellschaft 1945/49&amp;ndash;1989'', ed.

Health officers in India are expected to have prescribed qualifications, such as a Bachelor of Sanitary Science (B.S.Sc.), a degree of an institution recognized by the [[Medical Council of India]] or a diploma in Public Health after a 2-year study at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification No:22/2014 Health Officer in the Tamil Nadu Public Health Service, 2013-2014|url=http://www.tnpsc.gov.in/notifications/22_2014_not_eng_Health_Officer.pdf|publisher=TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION|accessdate=8 November 2015|pages=14|format=pdf|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobbing''', as a sociological term, means [[bullying]] of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online.

When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as ‘ganging up’ by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace'' by Noa Davenport, Ruth D. Schwartz and Gail Pursell Elliott.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the concept ==
[[Konrad Lorenz]], in his book entitled ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), first described mobbing among birds and animals, attributing it to instincts rooted in the [[Darwinian]] struggle to thrive (see [[animal mobbing behavior]]). In his view, most humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control.&lt;ref name="Westhues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/mobbing.htm|title=Workplace Mobbing in Academe|website=arts.uwaterloo.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's explanation for his choice of the English word Mobbing was omitted in the English translation by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. According to [[Kenneth Westhues]], Lorenz chose the word mobbing because he remembered in the collective attack by birds, the old German term ''hassen auf'', which means "to hate after" or "to put a hate on" was applied and this emphasised "the depth of antipathy with which the attack is made" rather than the English word mobbing which emphasised the collective aspect of the attack.&lt;ref&gt; Westhues, Kenneth.(2007) [http://www.kwesthues.com/graz0701.htm Mobbing a Natural Fact], Adapted and revised from "Mobbing am akademischen Arbeitsplatz," a lecture given in the Society for Sociology at the University of Graz, Austria, on 23 January 2007, Retrieved on 17 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, the Swedish physician {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter-Paul Heinemann|sv|3=Peter-Paul Heinemann|vertical-align=sup}} applied Lorenz's conceptualization to the collective aggression of children against a targeted child.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt;

In the 1980s, professor and practising psychologist [[Heinz Leymann]] applied the term to ganging up in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt; 

In 2011, anthropologist Janice Harper published an essay in [[The Huffington Post]] suggesting that some of the anti-bully approaches effectively constitute a form of mobbing by using the label "bully" to dehumanize, encouraging people to shun and avoid people labeled bullies, and in some cases, sabotage their work or refuse to work with them, while almost always calling for their exclusion and termination from employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper/the-bully-label-has-to-go_b_1068456.html|title=The Bully Label Has to Go|first=Janice|last=Harper|date=1 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
Janice Harper followed her Huffington Post essay with a series of essays in both The Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper|title=Janice Harper - HuffPost|website=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her column, Beyond Bullying: Peacebuilding at Work, School and Home in Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-bullying|title=Beyond Bullying|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; that argued that mobbing is a form of group aggression innate to primates, and that those who engage in mobbing are not necessarily "evil" or "psychopathic," but responding in a predictable and patterned manner when someone in a position of leadership or influence communicates to the group that someone must go. For that reason, she indicated that anyone can and will engage in mobbing, and that once mobbing gets underway, just as in the animal kingdom it will almost always continue and intensify as long as the target remains with the group. She subsequently published a book on the topic&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mobbed-What-When-They-Really/dp/0692693335/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Mobbed!: What to Do When They Really Are Out to Get You|first=Janice Harper|last=Ph.D|date=24 August 2013|publisher=Backdoor Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she explored animal behavior, organizational cultures and historical forms of group aggression, suggesting that mobbing is a form of group aggression on a continuum of structural violence with genocide as the most extreme form of mob aggression.

== In the workplace ==
{{main article|Workplace bullying}}
British anti-bullying researchers [[Andrea Adams]] and [[Tim Field]] have used the expression "workplace bullying" instead of what Leymann called "mobbing" in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as "an emotional assault. It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through [[innuendo]], rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace."&lt;ref name="amwork"&gt;Davenport NZ, Schwartz RD &amp; Elliott GP [http://www.mobbing-usa.com Mobbing, Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace], 3rd Edition 2005, Civil Society Publishing. Ames, IA,&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams and Field believe that mobbing is typically found in work environments that have poorly organised production or working methods and incapable or inattentive management and that mobbing victims are usually "exceptional individuals who demonstrated intelligence, competence, creativity, integrity, accomplishment and dedication".&lt;ref name="amwork" /&gt;

In contrast, Janice Harper&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; suggests that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations where there is limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that make it difficult to terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, fire fighting, military), organizations where a single gender has predominated, but the other gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, fire fighting, military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she suggests that organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader's personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader's bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.

Shallcross, Ramsay and Barker consider workplace "mobbing" to be a generally unfamiliar term in some English speaking countries. Some researchers claim that mobbing is simply another name for bullying. Workplace mobbing can be considered as a "virus" or a "cancer" that spreads throughout the workplace via [[gossip]], [[rumour]] and [[unfounded accusations]]. It is a deliberate attempt to force a person out of their workplace by [[humiliation]], general [[harassment]], [[emotional abuse]] and/or [[terrorism|terror]]. Mobbing can be described as being "ganged up on." Mobbing is executed by a leader (who can be a manager, a co-worker, or a subordinate). The leader then rallies others into a systematic and frequent "mob-like" behaviour toward the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Shallcross, L, Ramsay, S, &amp; Barker M, (2008) [http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf Workplace Mobbing: Expulsion, Exclusion, and Transformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045605/http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf |date=13 July 2011 }}, retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobbing as "downward bullying" by superiors is also known as "bossing", and "upward bullying" by colleagues as "staffing", in some European countries, for instance, in German-speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;Oberhofer, P [http://www.business-wissen.de/artikel/bossing-und-staffing-mobbing-zwischen-chef-und-mitarbeitern/ Bossing und Staffing], retrieved 25 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and health effects ===
Victims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: [[adjustment disorders]], somatic symptoms, [[psychological trauma]] (e.g., trauma [[tremor]]s or sudden onset [[selective mutism]]), [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and [[major depression]].&lt;ref name="CPV"&gt;Hillard JR [http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf Workplace mobbing: Are they really out to get your patient?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509035009/http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf |date=9 May 2010 }} Current Psychiatry Volume 8 Number 4 April 2009 Pages 45–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that the "mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or prison camp experiences." Some patients may develop alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely suffer. Workplace targets and witnesses may even develop brief psychotic episodes [[occupational psychosis]] generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.&lt;ref name="CPV" /&gt;

== At school ==
{{See also|School bullying}}
Following on from the work of Heinemann, Elliot identifies mobbing as a common phenomenon in the form of group bullying at school. It involves 'ganging up' on someone using tactics of [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[discrediting]], [[Social rejection|isolating]], [[intimidating]], and above all, making it look as if the targeted person is responsible ([[victim blaming]]).&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott GP [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHm5dqvPLSwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PR8&amp;dq=mobbing+bully+checklist ''School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse: See it – Stop it – Prevent it with Dignity and Respect'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== In academia ==
{{See also|Bullying in academia}}
[[Kenneth Westhues]]' study of mobbing in [[academia]] found that [[vulnerability]] was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in fields such as music or literature which have recently come under the sway of less objective and more [[post-modern]] scholarship; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Other factors included [[envy]], [[heresy]] and [[campus politics]].&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{citation |url=http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |title=Workplace Bullying in the Academic World? |date=13 May 2007 |publisher=Higher Education Development Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185410/http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Checklists ==
Sociologists and authors have created checklists and other tools to identify mobbing behaviour.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westhues2"&gt;Westhues K. [http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/checklist.htm Checklist of Mobbing Indicators] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohut MR [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSREF06T2ZQC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA169 ''The Complete Guide to Understanding, Controlling, and Stopping Bullies &amp; Bullying at Work: A Complete Guide for Managers, Supervisors, and Co-Workers'']&lt;/ref&gt; Common approaches to assessing mobbing behavior is through quantifying frequency of mobbing behavior based off a given definition of the behavior or through quantifying what respondents believe encompasses mobbing behavior. These are referred to as "self-labeling" and "behavior experience" methods respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steffgen|first1=Georges|last2=Sischka|first2=Philipp|last3=Schmidt|first3=Alexander|last4=Kohl|first4=Diane|last5=Happ|first5=Christian|title=The Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale|journal=European Journal of Psychological Assessment|date=2016|doi=10.1027/1015-5759/a000381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations of some mobbing examination tools are:
* Participant exhaustion due to examination length
* Limited sample exposure resulting in limited result generalizability
* Confounding with constructs that result in the same affect as mobbing but are not purposely harmful 

Common Tools used to measure mobbing behavior are:
* Leyman Inventory of Psychological Terror&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leymann|first1=Heinz|title=Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror|journal=Tübingen: Deutsche Gellschaft für Verhaltenstherapie Verlag.|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LIPT)
* Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einarsen|first1=Staale|last2=Hoel|first2=Helge|last3=Notelaers|first3=Guy|title=Measuring exposure to bullying and harassment at work: Validity, factor structure and psychometric properties of the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised|journal=Work &amp; Stress|date=2009|volume=23|pages=24-44|doi=10.1080/02678370902815673}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NAQ-R)

The [http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf Waterloo Anti-Mobbing  Instruments (WAMI)] created by [[Kenneth Westhues]] contains a 16 item checklist to identify the signs of mobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf |title=Conference Summary |format=PDF |date=2004 |accessdate=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counteracting Mobbing ==
From an organizational perspective, it has been suggested that mobbing behavior can be curtailed by acknowledging behaviors as mobbing behaviors and that such behaviors result in harm and/or negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=Len|title=Workplace mobbing and bullying: a consulting psychology perspective and overview|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=165-168|doi=10.1037/a0016936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise definitions of such traits are critical due to ambiguity of unacceptable and acceptable behaviors potentially leading to unintentional mobbing behavior. Attenuation of mobbing behavior can further be enhanced by developing policies that explicitly address specific behaviors that are culturally accepted to result in harm or negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Maureen|title=Preventing workplace mobbing and bullying with effective organizational consultation, policies, and legislation|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=242-262|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a framework from which mobbing victims can respond to mobbing. Lack of such a framework may result in a situation where each instance of mobbing is treated on an individual basis with no recourse of prevention. It may also indicate that such behaviors are warranted and within the realm of acceptable behavior within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferris|first1=Patricia|title=The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=169-189|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct responses to grievances related to mobbing that are handled outside of a courtroom and training programs outlining antibully-countermeasures also demonstrate a reduction in mobbing behavior.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

{{Nazism sidebar}}
A '''Nazi punk''' is a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] who is part of the [[punk subculture]]. The term also describes the related music genre,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Amy. ''The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists.'' Backbeat Books, 2007. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes also referred to as '''hatecore'''. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of [[punk rock]], but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some [[Minority groups|ethnic minorities]], [[Jews]], [[homosexuality |homosexuals]],[[anarchism| anarchists]], and other perceived enemies. 

It is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the [[anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. While early punks including [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]] incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika|Swastikas]], this has commonly been interpreted as an attempt to shock, rather than as a genuine belief in principles of Nazism.  In the long-standing band [[The Exploited]], [[Wattie Buchan]] has been regularly questioned about his swastika tattoo and he has constantly denied being a racist.&lt;ref name=Documentary&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E Documentary on the history of the band The Exploited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several [[English people|English]] punks, as well as forming a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984'' (Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger, ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk.'' (Routledge, 1999), pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the [[white power skinhead]] band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detour-records.co.uk/STRAPS.htm "The Straps: History"]&lt;/ref&gt; They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the [[United States]] by the early 1980s in the [[hardcore punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Mark. ''Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital.'' Akashic Books, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Michael. ''Globalizing the Streets.'' Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

''' The Pony Express Bible ''' is a Protestant Bible that was distributed to the [[Pony Express|Pony Express riders]] in 1860 and 1861.

== Description ==
The special edition leather-bound Bible was given to all the employees by the operators [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]].{{sfn|Godfrey|1994|p=62|}}{{sfn|Chapman|1932|p=300|}} Its dimensions are about 5.7 inches (14.5&amp;nbsp;cm) tall by 3.6 inches (9.1&amp;nbsp;cm) wide and a little over 2 inches thick.{{sfn|Newberry Library|1968|p=46}}{{sfn|Heritage Auctions|2010|p=95}} It has 1,278 double-columned pages.&lt;ref name=Ephemera&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ephemera.ning.com/photo/original-russell-majors-waddell-pony-express-bible-1858 |title=Original Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell "Pony Express Bible," 1858|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website= The Ephemera Network |publisher= Mike Ferguson|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copies of the Bible were specifically commissioned by [[Alexander Majors]] and contained full versions of both the Old and New Testaments. The firm had originally purchased these special copies for their company's wagon-train employees.{{sfn|Livingston|1948|p=46}} The Bibles had gold lettering on the cover with a contemporary inscription and the wording, "Presented by Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. 1858".{{sfn|Parke-Bernet Galleries|1947|p=9}} The source for the Old and New Testaments was an 1858 [[King James Version]] published by the [[American Bible Society]] in New York City.{{sfn|Newberry Library|1968|p=46}}

On commencing employment, a Pony Express rider was given one of the special edition Bibles.{{sfn|Corbett|2003|p=46 ''Alexander Majors of the great freight-hauling firm of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, which underwrote this venture, gave every employee a little calfskin-bound Bible, although the curious often wondered how a man riding a horse at a gallop from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, would have had occasion for Bible study'' }} The rider had to swear to and sign the ''frontier pledge'' of loyalty, honesty, and sobriety,{{sfn|Settle|1975|p=45 ''When the job was done [recruiting], about thirty riders had signed Majors' pledge, given bond for the faithful performance of their duty, and received a little Bible'' }}{{sfn|Guthrie|Smith|2009|p=21}} that was on the inside front cover of the Bible:&lt;ref name=BancroftLibrary&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b10529605~S1 |title= UCB Library Catalog |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=The Regents of the University of California |publisher= University of California |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I, ......, do hereby swear, before the Great and Living God, that during my engagement, and while I am an employee of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, I will, under no circumstances, use profane language, that I will drink no intoxicating liquors, that I will not quarrel or fight with any other employee of the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct myself honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct all my acts as to win the confidence of my employers, so help me God.|Oath sworn by Pony Express Riders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Richard|title=The City of the Saints|year=1862|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

It appears that the 183 riders employed from April 1860 to November 1861 did not take the pledge very seriously as, on the whole, they were considered dreadful, rough and unconventional.{{sfn|Bradley|Smith|1960|p=66}}

== Background ==
Alexander Majors, one of the original operators of the Pony Express, had religious convictions and required certain principles be held that he related to the Christian Bible.{{sfn|Jeffrey|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|Settle|1975|p=7 ''In writing that pledge and requiring his employees to sign and keep it, Majors was giving expression to his lifelong, stern, Calvinistic Presbyterian sentiments. He read his Bible regularly, attended church when he could, and sought to practice Christian principles in all his relations with other men.'' Note: this was written about his life prior to establishing the Pony Express, but similar pledges were used for the employees of his various companies.}} Examples were not to swear in public or drink intoxicating alcoholic beverages and that each rider was to honor Sunday as a day of rest.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html |title=Pony Express: Romance versus Reality |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website=National Postal Museum |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Pony Express riders were issued certain pieces of equipment to carry, which included a [[bowie knife]], and the Pony Express Bible.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada&gt;{{cite web |url= http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=Pony%20Express%20Bible;id=pur1.32754077529620;view=plaintext;seq=6;start=1;size=10;page=search|title=The Pony Express in Nevada |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1990 |website= |publisher= U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management|accessdate=5/3/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, most of this hardware was abandoned because it was too heavy to carry and looked upon as extra unnecessary items for their journey.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada/&gt; Some sources say that the riders carried the Bible given them, at least in the beginning. {{sfn|Jeffrey|2010|p=22}} Other sources say the riders never carried their Bible since it added weight that would slow down the pony they were riding.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; Many of the riders took only a single pistol with an extra cylinder of bullets on their rides.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada/&gt; Some didn't even take a gun, depending instead on the speed of their pony for their greatest defense against hostilities.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada/&gt;

The [[Pony Express#Pony Express route|Pony Express route]] that the riders used went through the Territories of [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] sharing relay stations with the [[Butterfield Overland Mail Company]] stagecoach line. The Overland Mail Company eventually did take over the western portion of the Pony Express route that went to [[Sacramento, California]], when the Pony Express firm was dissolved in 1861. The Pony Express route went through what are now the states of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California.&lt;ref name=route&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xphomestation.com/xproute.html |title=Pony Express Route |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Pony Express History |publisher= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pray the Devil Back to Hell''''' is a [[documentary film]] directed by Gini Reticker and produced by [[Abigail Disney]]. The film premiered at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/home/18455719.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303043905/http://www.tribecafilm.com/home/18455719.html |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had its theatrical release in New York City on November 7, 2008.

The film documents a [[peace movement]] called [[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace]]. Organized by social worker [[Leymah Gbowee]], the movement started with praying and singing in a fish market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odemagazine.com/blogs/readers_blog/9001/leymah_gbowee_peace_warrior_for_liberia 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227090728/http://www.odemagazine.com/blogs/readers_blog/9001/leymah_gbowee_peace_warrior_for_liberia |date=2009-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leymah Gbowee organized the [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] women of [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]] to pray for peace and to organize [[nonviolent]] protests. Dressed in white to symbolize peace, and numbering in the thousands, the women became a political force against violence and against their government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guideposts.com/blog/life-faith-liberia-peace-movement-women|title=Blogs|work=Guideposts|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their movement led to the election of [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] in Liberia, the first [[Africa]]n nation with a [[female president]]. The film has been used as an [[advocacy]] tool in post-conflict zones like [[Sudan]], mobilizing African women to petition for peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaglobal.org/article/2009-11-01/pray-the-devil-back-to-hell-documentary-serves-as-advocacy-tool-in-post-conflict-zones/ November 2009 MEDIAGLOBAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710093803/http://www.mediaglobal.org/article/2009-11-01/pray-the-devil-back-to-hell-documentary-serves-as-advocacy-tool-in-post-conflict-zones/ |date=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
A group of ordinary women in [[Liberia]], led by Leymah Gbowee, came together to pray for peace. Armed only with white T-shirts and the courage of their convictions, they demanded a resolution to the country’s civil war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awdfchicago.org/about-film.html African Women Development Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922002001/http://www.awdfchicago.org/about-film.html |date=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Leymah Gbowee's leadership, the women managed to force a meeting with President [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] and extract a promise from him to attend peace talks in [[Ghana]]. Gbowee then led a delegation of Liberian women to Ghana to continue to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2008/11/inf/GboweeLeymah.html Center for American Progress]&lt;/ref&gt; They staged a silent protest outside of the [[Golden Jubilee House|Presidential Palace, Accra]], bringing about an agreement during the stalled peace talks.

Asatu Bah Kenneth is featured in the film. She is currently Assistant Minister for Administration and Public Safety of the Liberian Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unmil.org/1article.asp?id=3718&amp;zdoc=1|title=UNMIL – Misión de las Naciones Unidas en Liberia|website=unmil.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, she was the president of the Liberia Female Law Enforcement Association. Inspired by the work of the Christian women's peace initiative, she formed the Liberian Muslim Women's Organization to work for peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/detail/64653.html United Nations Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Working together, over 3,000 [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] women mobilized their efforts, and as a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and helped bring to power the country's first female head of state.

== Title ==
The title of the film is drawn from Gbowee’s statement about Taylor and the rebels. Both sides were supposedly religious. The rebels frequented mosques, while Taylor claimed to be a devout Christian who, according to Gbowee, could “pray the devil out of Hell.” It was therefore the responsibility of the women in this inter-faith coalition to pray the devil (of war) right back to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/ArtsandCulture/Film/5547883-147/story.csp Praying the Liberian war back to hell ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402203842/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/ArtsandCulture/Film/5547883-147/story.csp |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scalping''' is the act of cutting or tearing a part of the human [[scalp]], with hair attached, from the head.

This can either occur as part of war with the scalp being a [[Human trophy collecting|trophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Anastasia M. (2008). [[Georg Friederici]]'s (1906) "Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America" with a Critical Introduction. ProQuest. {{ISBN|9780549562092}} p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; or as an accident. Scalp-taking is considered part of the broader cultural practice of the taking and display of human body parts as trophies, and may have developed as an alternative to the taking of human heads, for scalps were easier to take, transport, and preserve for subsequent display. Scalping independently developed in various cultures in both the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Trophy Taking in Eastern North America During the Archaic Period: The Relationship to Warfare and Social Complexity|author1=Mensforth, Robert P. |work=The Taking and Displaying of Human Body Parts as Trophies by Amerindians|author2=Chacon, Richard J.

In England in 1036,  [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]], father of [[Harold Godwinson]], was reportedly responsible for scalping his enemies. According to the ancient [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Abingdon manuscript]], 'some of them were blinded, some maimed, some scalped. No more horrible deed was done in this country since the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] came and made peace here'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820140611/https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html |archivedate=2017-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Frederici noted that “[[Herodotus]] provided the only clear and satisfactory portrayal of a scalping people in the old world” in his description of the [[Scythians]], a nomadic people then located to the north and west of the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Griffin, Anastasia M. (editor) |title=Critical Introduction|date=2008| author2=Frederici, Georg |work=Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America |publisher= ProQuest|isbn=9780549562092|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus related that Scythian warriors would behead the enemies they defeated in battle and present the heads to their king to claim their share of the plunder. Then, the warrior would skin the head “by making a circular cut round the ears and shaking out the skull; he then scrapes the flesh off the skin with the rib of an ox, and when it is clean works it with his fingers until it is supple, and fit to be used as a sort of handkerchief. He hangs these handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse, and is very proud of them. The best man is the man who has the greatest number.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herodotus|title= The Histories|author2= De Selincourt, Aubrey (translator)|publisher= Penguin Books|location= London|date= 2003|pages= 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] noted the taking of scalps by the [[Alani]], a people of Asiatic [[Scythia]], in terms quite similar to those used by Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcellinus, Ammianus |title= Roman History, Book XXXI, II|location= London|publisher= Bohn|date= 1862|page= 22|author2=Yonge, C.D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbé [[Emmanuel H. D. Domenech]] referenced the ''decalvare'' of the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] and the ''capillos et cutem detrahere'' of the code of the [[Visigoths]] as examples of scalping in early [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Domenech, Abbe Emmanuel |title= Seven Years’ Residence in the Great Deserts of North America, Vol. 2|location= London|publisher= Longman Green|date= 1860|page= 358}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some more recent interpretations of these terms relate them to shaving off the hair of the head as a legal punishment rather than scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crouch, Jace |title=The Judicial Punishment of Delcavatio in Visigothic Spain: A Proposed Solution based on Isidore of Seville and the Lex Visigothorum|pages=  1–5}} and Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, mercenary John Duncan observed what he estimated to be 700 scalps taken in warfare and displayed as trophies by a contingent of female soldiers  — [[Dahomey Amazons]] — employed by the King of Dahomey (present-day [[Republic of Benin]]). Duncan noted that these would have been taken and kept over a long period of time and would not have come from a single battle. Although Duncan travelled widely in Dahomey, and described customs such as the taking of heads and the retention of skulls as trophies, nowhere else does he mention scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in Western Africa in 1845 &amp; 1846, Comprising a Journey from Whydah, through the Kingdom of Dahomey, to Adofoodia, in the Interior, Vol. I|author=Duncan, John |location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley|date= 1847|pages= 233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in Western Africa in 1845 &amp; 1846, Comprising a Journey from Whydah, through the Kingdom of Dahomey, to Adofoodia, in the Interior, Vol. II|author=Duncan, John |location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley|date= 1847|pages= 274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques===
Specific scalping techniques varied somewhat from place to place, depending on the cultural patterns of the scalper regarding the desired shape, size, and intended use of the severed scalp, and on how the victims wore their hair, but the general process of scalping was quite uniform.  The scalper firmly grasped the hair of a subdued adversary, made several quick semicircular cuts with a sharp instrument on either side of the area to be taken, and then vigorously yanked at the nearly-severed scalp. The scalp separated from the skull along the plane of the [[Loose_connective_tissue#Areolar_tissue|areolar connective tissue]], the fourth (and least substantial) of the five layers of the human scalp. Scalping was not in itself fatal, though it was most commonly inflicted on the gravely wounded or the dead. The earliest instruments used in scalping were stone knives crafted of [[flint]], [[chert]], or [[obsidian]], or other materials like [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] or [[oyster]] shells that could be worked to carry an edge equal to the task. Collectively, such tools were also used for a variety of everyday tasks like skinning and processing game, but were replaced by metal knives acquired in trade through European contact. The implement, often referred to as a “scalping knife” in popular [[American literature|American]] and European literature, was not known as such by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], a knife being for them just a simple and effective multi-purpose utility tool for which scalping was but one of many uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton, Richard F. |title=Anthropological Review, Vol. 2, No. 4 |date=February 1864|pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Griffin, Anastasia M.

[[File:Sauvages Tchaktas matachez en Guerriers qui portent des Chevelures.jpg|thumb|Choctaw American Indians, in warpaint, bearing scalps, Alexandre de Batz, 1732]]
Author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote, "Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war{{'"}}, in which civilians are targeted, "for conflicts between modern industrial nations," the term "closely approaches the state of affairs between the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]], the [[Great Sioux Nation|Sioux]], and the [[Cheyennes]]. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=van de Logt |year=2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bbgh_hA4ib4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=War Party in Blue: Pawnee Scouts in the U.S. Army |publisher= [[University of Oklahoma Press]] | page=35 |isbn=0806184396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tribes of Native Americans practiced scalping, in some instances up until the end of the 19th century. Of the approximately 500 bodies at the [[Crow Creek massacre]] site, 90 percent of the skulls show evidence of scalping. The event took place ''circa'' 1325 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Both the Mi'kmaq people and the British killed combatants and non-combatants (i.e., women, children, and infants).

=== American Revolution ===
In the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], the Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at [[Fort Detroit]], was known by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Patriots]] as the "hair-buyer general" because they believed he encouraged and paid his Native American allies to scalp American settlers. When Hamilton was captured in the war by the colonists, he was treated as a [[war criminal]] instead of a [[prisoner of war]] because of this. However, American historians have conceded that there was no positive proof that he had ever offered rewards for scalps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Arthur |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hamilton_henry_4E.html |title=Hamilton, Henry |volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now assumed that during the American Revolution, no British officer paid for scalps.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Sullivan Expedition]], the September 13, 1779 journal entry of Lieutenant William Barton tells of patriots participating in scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924095654384#page/n38/mode/1up/ |title=Journals of the military expedition of Major General John Sullivan against the Six nations of Indians in 1779; with records of centennial celebrations; prepared pursuant to chapter 361, laws of the state of New York, of 1885 |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322181618/http://archive.org/stream/cu31924095654384#page/n38/mode/1up/ |archivedate=2016-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
In 1835, the government of the Mexican state of [[Sonora]] put a bounty on the [[Apache]] which,&lt;ref name="haley"/&gt; over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. In 1837, the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] also offered a bounty on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child.&lt;ref name="haley"&gt;{{cite book |first=James L. |last=Haley |authorlink=James L.

===Civil War===
Some scalping incidents even occurred during the [[American Civil War]].  For example, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War|guerrillas]] led by [[William T. Anderson|"Bloody Bill" Anderson]] were well known for decorating their saddles with the scalps of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union soldiers]] they had killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/james/peopleevents/p_anderson.html |title=William "Bloody Bill" Anderson .

===Continued Indian Wars===

In 1851, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] displayed Indian scalps in [[Stanislaus County, California]]. In [[Tehama County, California]], U.S. military and local volunteers razed villages and scalped hundreds of men, women, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfaelzer|first1=Jean|title=Driven Out: The Forgotten War against Chinese Americans|date=2007|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=July 2018}}

Scalping also occurred during the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] on November 29, 1864, during the [[American Indian Wars]], when a 700-man force of U.S. Army volunteers destroyed the village of [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] in southeastern [[Colorado Territory]], killing and mutilating&lt;ref name="A Century of Dishonor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Helen|title=A Century of Dishonor|date=1994|publisher=Indian Head Books|location=United States|isbn=1-56619-167-X|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoig_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoig|first=Stan|title=The Sand Creek Massacre|year=2005|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|page=153|isbn=978-0-8061-1147-6|origyear=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; an estimated 70–163 Native Americans.&lt;ref name=Dee_book&gt;{{cite book| last = Brown| first = Dee| title = Bury my heart at Wounded Knee| origyear  = 1970| publisher = Macmillan| chapter = War Comes to the Cheyenne| pages = 86–87| isbn = 978-0-8050-6634-0| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm |title=THE WEST - Who is the Savage? |website=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726000602/http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm |archivedate=2016-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Evans Study Report|url=https://portfolio.du.edu/downloadItem/286858|publisher=University of Denver|accessdate=6 January 2016|date=November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207203926/https://portfolio.du.edu/downloadItem/286858|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1867 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article reported that "settlers in a small town in Colorado Territory had recently subscribed $5,000 to a fund ‘for the purpose of buying Indian scalps (with $25 each to be paid for scalps with the ears on)’ and that the market for Indian scalps ‘is not affected by age or sex’." The article noted this behavior was "sanctioned" by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and was modeled on patterns the U.S. had begun a century earlier in the "American East".&lt;ref name="Kakel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kakel|first1=Carroll P.|title=The American West and the Nazi East, A Comparative and Interpretive Perspective|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

From one writer's point of view, it was a "uniquely American" innovation that the use of scalp bounties in the wars against indigenous societies "became an indiscriminate killing process that deliberately targeted Indian non-combatants (including women, children, and infants), as well as warriors."&lt;ref name="Kakel"/&gt;{{rp|204}}

'''Slavery''' has been called "deeply rooted" in the structure of the northwestern African country of '''Mauritania''', and "closely tied" to the ethnic composition of the country.&lt;ref name="Ghanem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/politics/africa/438414 |title=Slavery in Mauritania Emancipating the Free |date=21 August 2007 |website=onislam.net |publisher= |last1=Ghanem |first1=Omar |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028173723/http://www.onislam.net/english/politics/africa/438414 |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, an end of slavery in [[Mauritania]] was declared by the colonial French administration but the vastness of Mauritania mostly gave the law very few successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/index.html|title=Slavery's Last Stronghold|publisher=CNN|language=English|author=John D.

It notes that: 
"Slavery was outlawed in 1981 but 1% of the population are still living in bondage, human rights groups say.

Black people of certain ethnic groups are often enslaved as domestic workers by lighter-skinned Mauritanians.

The country has jailed more anti-slavery activists than slave owners, rights groups say." [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43600274]

A November 2009 [[United Nations]] mission, headed by [[UN Special Rapporteur]] Gulnara Shahinian, evaluated slavery practices in the country.&lt;ref&gt;ANI and Journal Tahalil reported on 2 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2010 report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) it concluded that "despite laws, programmes and difference of opinion with regard to the existence of slavery in Mauritania, ... de facto slavery continues to exist in Mauritania".&lt;ref name=UNHRC-8-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Gulnara Shahinian Addendum Mission to Mauritania |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/slavery/rapporteur/docs/A.HRC.15.20.Add.2_en.pdf|publisher= Human Rights Council, United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=24 October 2014|date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave status has been passed down through the generations.&lt;ref name=DOS-2014/&gt; The descendants of black Africans captured during historical slave raids now live in Mauritania as "black Moors" or ''[[haratin]]'', some of them still serve as slaves to the lighter-skinned "white" or ''beydan'' ("Whites")&lt;ref name=Ghanem/&gt; ([[Berbers]] or mixed Berber-[[Arab]]s, descendants of slave-owners known collectively as ''al-beydan'').&lt;ref name=DOS-2014&gt;{{cite web|title=US Trafficking in Persons Report 2013, Mauritania Country Narrative|format=PDF|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/210740.pdf|website=state.gov|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=24 October 2014|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Global Slavery Index, slavery of adults and children in Mauritania "primarily takes the form of [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slavery]]" (i.e. the slaves and their descendants "are the full property of their masters").&lt;ref name=GSI2013/&gt;  Slaves "may be bought and sold, rented out and given away as gifts".&lt;ref name=GSI2013/&gt; Slavery in Mauritania is "prevalent in both rural and urban areas", but women are reportedly "disproportionately affected" by slavery. Women slaves "usually work within the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]", caring for children and doing domestic chores, but "may also herd animals and farm". Women slaves "are subject to sexual assault by their masters".&lt;ref name=GSI2013/&gt; Because slave status is [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]], slaves typically serve the same families that their mothers and grandmothers did. They usually sleep and eat in the same quarters as the animals of their owning families.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt; Slaves are "not restrained by chains" but by "economic" and "psychological" factors. They are denied education in secular fields that provide job skills, and taught that "questioning slavery is tantamount to questioning [[Islam]]".&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt; There is also a "grey area"&lt;ref name=Mark-27102014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mark|first1=Monica|title=Slavery still shackles Mauritania, 31 years after its abolition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/slavery-still-shackles-mauritania|accessdate=27 October 2014|agency=The Guardian|date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "a continuum" between slavery and freedom in Mauritania&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt;—referred to politely as the "vestiges of slavery"—where sharecroppers and workers are exploited by Beydane landowners and bosses.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt; According to Ahmed Vall Ould Dine, of Mauritanian Human Rights Watch, "Slaves tend to develop very close relations with their masters; the freed ones, who are poor and have inherited nothing from their parents, chose to remain under the auspices of their ex-masters as they provide them with basic necessities of life."&lt;ref name=Ghanem/&gt;

Two academics, Ahmed Meiloud  and Mohamed El Mokhtar Sidi Haiba, have criticized statements on slavery in Mauritania by anti-slavery organizations and writers for alleged exaggeration, lack of statistical sources, factual errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery in Mauritania: Differentiating between facts and fiction|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/essays/slavery-mauritania-differentiating-between-facts-and-fiction-103800371| website= middleeasteye.net|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government position==
[[File:Slave owner, rights activists convicted in Mauritania (5369376161).jpg|thumb|[[Marie-José Domestici-Met]] ([[Commission nationale consultative des droits de l'homme|CNCDH]]) and [[Biram Dah Abeid]] who in 2009 was sentenced to six months in prison for allegedly taking part in unauthorised rally.]]
The government of Mauritania (which is dominated by Beydanes)&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt; denies that slavery exists in the country. According to Abdel Nasser Ould Ethmane, a political adviser to the African Union and a cofounder of the abolitionist group SOS Slaves, the Mauritanian government's "line" on slavery is: "Slavery no longer exists, and talk of it suggests manipulation by the West, an act of enmity toward Islam, or influence from the worldwide Jewish conspiracy."&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt;

Responding to accusations of human rights abuse, in 2012 the Mauritanian Minister of rural development, Brahim Ould M'Bareck Ould Med El Moctar, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I must tell you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, equality – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news| url= http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/17/mauritanian-minister-responds-to-accusations-that-slavery-is-rampant/ | work=CNN | title= Mauritanian minister responds to accusations that slavery is rampant | date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2013, the President established an agency to "combat slavery", known as the "National Agency to Fight against the Vestiges of Slavery, Integration, and Fight against Poverty".&lt;ref name=GSI2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cndh.mr/content/view/180/1/ Creating a National Agency for the Fight against the Legacy of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024200236/http://www.cndh.mr/content/view/180/1/ |date=2014-10-24 }}" (21 March 2013), National Commission for Human Rights in Mauritania&lt;/ref&gt; The director, Hamdi Ould Mahjoub, a Beydane, told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' author Alexis Okeowo, "Slavery as an institution, as something accepted by society, does not exist" in Mauritania, and that his agency was working on a program to help farmers and others to build clinics and improve access to water.&lt;ref name= NYER-2014 /&gt;

==Causes of persistence==
Among the reasons given for the difficulty of ending slavery in Mauritania are:
* Many of the slaves are isolated by illiteracy, poverty, and geography, and do not know that life outside servitude is possible.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt;
* The difficulty of enforcing any laws in the country's vast desert.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/index.html?hpt=hp_c1 Slavery's last stronghold]. CNN.com (16 March 2012). Retrieved 20 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Poverty that limits opportunities for slaves to support themselves if freed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Dependence on masters who provide food and clothing to slaves.&lt;ref name=anti-slavery&gt;{{cite web|title= Slavery In Mauritania |url= http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/descent_based_slavery/slavery_in_mauritania/default.aspx| website= anti-slavery.org| accessdate= 24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Difficulty of "running away" and leaving families in large parts of the country that are desert.&lt;ref name=anti-slavery/&gt; 
* Belief that slavery is part of the natural order of this society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Belief in a "misguided interpretation of Islam", in which slaves are "told that their paradise is bound to their master and that if they do what the master tells them, they will go to heaven".&lt;ref name=anti-slavery/&gt;
* Mauritanian laws, which place the burden of proof on the slave, require that a victim file a complaint before an investigation is launched, and that human rights organisations may not file a case on behalf of a victim, despite the fact that most slaves are illiterate.&lt;ref name=GSI2013/&gt;

==Antislavery organizations==
Mauritanian antislavery organizations include: 
* [[Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement]], (IRA-Mauritania) is led by [[Biram Dah Abeid]], a former slave .
* Al'Hor الحر (translated as "the free"). 
* In'itaq إنعتاق (translated as "emancipation"). 
* SOS Esclaves (meaning "SOS Slaves" in French) aids slaves to escape from their masters, and petitions the government and the clergy to address the problem of slavery, but stops short of aggressively confronting authorities like IRA-Mauritania. SOS was co-founded by {{ill|Boubacar Messaoud|fr|Boubacar Ould Messaoud}}, a former slave who went on to study engineering and architecture in Mali and Moscow. As of 2014, he was in his late sixties and so, according to Messaoud, may represent an older generation. In 2011, Messaoud and [[Biram Dah Abeid]] held a hunger strike in a Nouakchott police station until the police put a slave owner in jail.

The '''smallpox virus retention controversy''' is a debate that has been ongoing among international scientists and other officials since [[smallpox]] was declared eradicated by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1980. It centers on whether to finally and irreversibly destroy the two last remnants of the virus that causes smallpox, which reside in government laboratories in the [[United States]] and [[Russia]]. Advocates of final destruction maintain that there is no longer any valid rationale for retaining the samples, which represent a hazard, while opponents of it maintain that the samples are needed for further research as smallpox virus may still exist in the world outside of the two labs, and thus may re-emerge, particularly as a [[bio-weapon]].

==Background==
The last cases of smallpox occurred in an outbreak of two cases, one of which was fatal, in [[Birmingham]], UK, in 1978. A [[Medical photography|medical photographer]], [[Janet Parker]], contracted the disease at the [[University of Birmingham Medical School]] and died on September 11, 1978.&lt;ref name= Pennington&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862003001000014 |author=Pennington H. |title=Smallpox and bioterrorism |url= http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862003001000014&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |journal=Bull.

In 1986, the WHO first recommended destruction of all virus, and later set the date of destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EED61639F936A15752C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|date=1996-01-25|title=Final Stock of the Smallpox Virus Now Nearer to Extinction in Labs|first=Lawrence|last= Altman|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; then again to 30 June 2002. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the [[World Health Assembly]] agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323271.300-stay-of-execution.html|title=Stay of execution|date=2002-01-26|publisher=''New Scientist''|accessdate=2007-11-23|first=Debora|last=MacKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the stocks are not needed to respond to a smallpox outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=BMJ|year=2007|volume=334|issue=7597|page=774|title=Should the US and Russia destroy their stocks of smallpox virus?|last=Hammond|first=Edward|doi=10.1136/bmj.39155.695255.94|pmc=1851992|pmid=17431261|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=BMJ|year=2007|volume=334|issue=7597|page=775|title=Should the US and Russia destroy their stocks of smallpox virus?|last=Agwunobi|first=John O.|doi=10.1136/bmj.39156.490799.BE|pmc=1851995|pmid=17431262|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/775}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by the WHO, however, concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the U.S. and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks.&lt;ref name=AGIES&gt;[http://www.who.int/entity/csr/resources/publications/WHO_HSE_GAR_BDP_2010_4/en/index.html Comments on the Scientific Review of Variola Virus Research, 1999‐2010.] Advisory Group of Independent Experts to review the smallpox research program (AGIES) WHO document WHO/HSE/GAR/BDP/2010.4&lt;/ref&gt; The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program (1958–79).&lt;ref name=eradedit&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=J.Michael |last2=Poland |first2=Gregory A. |year=2011 |title=Why not destroy the remaining smallpox virus stocks? |journal=Vaccine |volume=29 |issue=16 |pages=2823–2824 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.02.081 |pmid=21376120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Infections==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
An ''Ad Hoc'' Committee on Orthopox Infections, advising the WHO, has debated the fate of the remaining samples of smallpox in the remaining two official repositories since 1980. Smallpox expert [[D. A. Henderson]] has been foremost in favor of destruction, while [[U.S. Army]] scientist [[Peter Jahrling]] has been against it on the basis that further research is needed since he believes that smallpox almost certainly exists outside of the repositories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Preston|Preston, Richard]] (2002), ''[[The Demon in the Freezer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have expressed similar opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Damon|first1=Inger k|title=Are we there yet?

==U.S. pro-retention argument (2011)==
In 2011, [[Kathleen Sebelius]], Secretary of the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]], laid out the rationale of the [[Obama Administration]] in a ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed piece. She said, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In 1980], the WHO called on all nations to destroy their collections of smallpox virus or transfer them to the WHO-sanctioned collections at one of two labs in Russia or the United States. The global public health community assumes that all nations acted in good faith; however, no one has ever attempted to verify or validate compliance with the WHO request…. Although keeping the samples may carry a minuscule risk, both the United States and Russia believe the dangers of destroying them now are far greater…. It is quite possible that undisclosed or forgotten stocks exist. Also, 30 years after the disease was eradicated, the virus’ genomic information is available online and the technology now exists for someone with the right tools and the wrong intentions to create a new smallpox virus in a laboratory…. Destroying the virus now is merely a symbolic act that would slow our progress and could even stop it completely, leaving the world vulnerable…. Destruction of the last securely stored viruses is an irrevocable action that should occur only when the global community has eliminated the threat of smallpox once and for all. To do any less keeps future generations at risk from the re-emergence of one of the deadliest diseases humanity has ever known. Until this research is complete, we cannot afford to take that risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathleen Sebelius|Sebelius, Kathleen]], (2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/opinion/26iht-edsebelius26.html?_r=0 “Why We Still need Smallpox”], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (25 April 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*On July 1, 2014, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) notified the regulatory agency, the [[Division of Select Agents and Toxins]] (DSAT) of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), that employees had discovered vials labelled "variola" (smallpox) in an unused portion of a storage room in a U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) laboratory located on the NIH [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] campus. An investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/s0708-NIH.html “CDC Media Statement on Newly Discovered Smallpox Specimens]” (July 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A media statement was released by the CDC regarding the Bethesda ''variola major'' (smallpox virus) situation seven days after the discovery. It confirmed that ''variola major'' had been found and it had been transferred to a [[BSL-4]] laboratory at the CDC in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Overnight [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing had shown the vials did contain ''variola major''. The vials were believed to have been from the 1950s. Further testing to find out if the virus was viable was in progress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further testing showed that the vials which dated from the 1950s contained viable (live) ''variola major'' virus. As of the end of 2014 the vials were placed in a secure freezer to await destruction. The protocol for destruction of ''variola major'' virus involves a member of the WHO being present at the destruction. Usually the observer watches via close circuit television outside the room where the ''variola virus'' will be [[autoclave]]d to destroy it. As a result of the [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] outbreak in parts of [[Africa]] at the time, the WHO were overstretched and stated they had no one locally with sufficient security clearance to enter a BSL-4 laboratory. Due to this the WHO were planning to fly an official into Atlanta to oversee the destruction at a future date.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The vials were finally destroyed on February 24, 2015, under the supervision of WHO officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/UCM532877.pdf|title=FDA Review of the 2014 Discovery of Vials Labeled "Variola" and Other Vials Discovered in an FDA-Occupied Building on the NIH Campus|date=13 December 2016|publisher=Director of Laboratory Science and Safety, FDA|access-date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WHO 2018 position==
As of  May 2018, based on the latest (19th) meeting of the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research (1–2 November 2017), the question remained as to whether the use of live variola virus for their further development was "essential for public health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/smallpox/variola-research-november-2017/en/|title=WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research Report of the Nineteenth Meeting|publisher=World Health Organization|date=May 2018|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">A '''sports chaplain''' provides [[pastoral care]] for the [[sportsperson|sports person]] and the broader [[sports]] community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, administrators and their families.

[[Chaplain]]s to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 a congress held in [[Hong Kong]] on sports [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the sub-continent and [[Australasia]]. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains.   

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration.  Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport.  This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

There were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as [[Athletes in Action]] and [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] also provide chaplains to various sports at the [[college athletics|collegiate]] and [[professional sports|professional]] levels.  Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation.  Every [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]] &amp; [[Major League Soccer]] franchise has a chaplain.  Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams.  In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip.  This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. 

In recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. 

In addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.

== United Kingdom ==
Sports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain]] to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Called Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[cricket]] and [[horseracing]].  They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the [[London2012]]  [[Olympics]].  All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.

== Australia ==
As a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by [[Mark Tronson]], the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete [[respite care|respite]]. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). 

As a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in [[Australia]] adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as [[cricket]], [[motor racing]], [[tennis]], [[rugby league]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[golf]], [[yachting]], [[skiing]], [[netball]], [[rodeo]] and [[horse racing]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], and State Institutes of Sport.

'''Substance abuse''', also known as '''drug abuse''', is a patterned use of a substance (drug) in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others. 
The drugs used are often associated with levels of intoxication that alter judgment, perception, attention and physical control, not related with medical  effects.  It is often thought that the main abused substances are illegal drugs and alcohol; however it is becoming more common that prescription drugs and tobacco are a prevalent problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Substance Abuse and Addiction Health Center |url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/substance-abuse | date=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Substance-related disorders''', including both substance dependence and substance abuse, can lead to large societal problems. It is found to be greatest in individuals ages 18–25, with a higher likelihood occurring in men compared to women, and urban residents compared to rural residents. On average, general medical facilities hold 20% of patients with substance-related disorders, possibly leading to psychiatric disorders later on. Over 50% of individuals with substance-related disorders will often have a "dual diagnosis," where they are diagnosed with the substance abuse, as well as a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being major depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders, and dysthymia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leikin|first=J.B.|title=Substance-Related Disorders in Adults|journal=Disease-a-month|year=2007|volume=53|issue=6|pages=313–335|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2007.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Common symptoms include:
*	Sudden changes in behaviour – may engage in secretive or suspicious behaviour 
*	Mood changes – anger towards others, paranoia and little care shown about themselves or their future
*	Problems with work or school – lack of attendance 
*	Changes in eating and sleeping habits 
*	Changes in friendship groups and poor family relationships 
*	A sudden unexplained change in financial needs – leading to borrowing/stealing money

There are many more symptoms such as physical and psychological changes, though this is often dependent on which drug is being abused. It is, however, common that abusers will experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if the drug is taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drug Abuse and Dependence Symptoms| url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/tc/drug-abuse-and-dependence-symptoms|accessdate= April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Drug Abuse and Addiction | url = http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/drug-abuse-and-addiction.htm |accessdate = April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also reported that others have strong cravings even after they have not used the drug for a long period of time. This is called being "clean". To determine how the brain triggers these cravings, multiple tests have been done on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|title='Drug binge' mice reveal why cravings linger|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13630-drug-binge-mice-reveal-why-cravings-linger.html|accessdate=2011-10-08|newspaper=Newscientist|date=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also now thought that these cravings can be explained by substance-related disorders as a subcategory of personality disorders as classified by the DSM-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = American Psychiatric Publishing | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth ed.) | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and terminology==

Substance-related disorders were originally subcategorized into "[[substance use disorder]]s" (SUD) and "substance-induced disorders" (SID).&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010056|substance-related disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GalanterKleber2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Galanter|author2=Herbert D. Kleber|title=The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of substance abuse treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wdJgejlQzYC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=23 April 2010|year=2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-276-4|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[DSM-IV]] makes a firm distinction between the two, SIDs often occur in the context of SUDs.&lt;ref name="FirstFrances2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael B. First|author2=Allen Frances|author3=Harold Alan Pincus|title=DSM-IV-TR guidebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU_L1KUsNfIC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=23 April 2010|year=2004|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-068-5|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance-induced disorders===

Substance-induced disorders include medical conditions that can be directly attributed to the use of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010072|Substance-induced disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions include [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], [[substance-induced delirium]], [[substance-induced psychosis]], and [[substance-induced mood disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Shaner2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Shaner|title=Psychiatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxYg4ON0CsMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA85|accessdate=23 April 2010|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-683-30766-5|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance use disorders===
{{Main|Substance use disorder}}

Substance use disorders include substance abuse and [[substance dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010058|Substance use disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DSM-IV, the conditions are formally diagnosed as one or the other, but it has been proposed that [[DSM-V]] combine the two into a single condition called "Substance-use disorder".&lt;ref name="urlProposed Revision | APA DSM-5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=431# |title=Proposed Revision &amp;#124; APA DSM-5 |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in Classification===

The more recently published [[DSM-5]] combined substance abuse and substance dependence into a single continuum; this is simply known as substance use disorder and requires more presenting symptoms before a diagnosis is made.  It also considers each different substance as its own separate disorder, based upon the same basic criteria.  It also distinguishes the difference between dependence and addictions as two separate disorders, not to be confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = American Psychiatric Publishing | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth ed. )|url = http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Substance%20Use%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential Complications===

There are many potential complications that can arise due to substance abuse such as severe physiological damage, psychological changes and social changes that are often not desirable.

Physiological damage is often the most obvious, observed as an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism: For instance, there are several known alcohol-induced diseases (e.g. [[alcoholic hepatitis]], [[alcoholic liver disease]], [[alcoholic cardiomyopathy]].)  Substance abuse is also often associated with premature ageing, fertility complications, brain damage and a higher risk of infectious diseases due to a weakened immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baignet |first=Michael | title = Physical complications of substance abuse: what psychiatrists need to know | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/452724_2|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Drug Addictions: complications | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/basics/complications/con-20020970 |accessdate= April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long term abuse has been linked to personality changes such as depression, paranoia, anxiety which can be related to psychological disorders. It is often reported that substance abuse coincides with personality disorders, such as [[borderline personality disorder]]. It has also now been linked to severe brain damage leading to an inability to control behaviours, which could explain why many people who abuse substances go on to develop addictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Drug Abuse and Dependence Symptoms | url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/tc/drug-abuse-and-dependence-symptoms|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trull |last2= Sher |last3= Minks Brown | last4=Durbin |last5=Burr | title = Borderline personality disorder and substance use disorder: A review and integration | journal = Clinical Psychology Review|year=2000|volume=20|issue=2|pages=235–253| doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(99)00028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jentsch |first1=j.d. |last2=Taylor |first2 =J.

Substance abuse is often regarded as negative in society and therefore those who engage in such behaviours can often be subject to social discrimination. The use of many drugs can lead to criminal convictions, whether the drug itself is illegal or abusers use unlawful methods to fund their substances. It is also more likely that someone will partake in criminal or anti-social behaviour when they are under the influence of a drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Abuse and Dependence Symptoms| url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/tc/drug-abuse-and-dependence-symptoms| date=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6871">'''Sustainable land management''' (SLM&lt;ref name=worldbank/&gt;) refers to practices and technologies that aim to integrate the [[land management|management of land]], [[water management|water]], [[biodiversity]], and other [[Environmental resource management|environmental resource]]s to meet human needs while ensuring the long-term [[sustainability]] of [[ecosystem]] services and livelihoods. The term sustainable land management is used, for example, in [[regional planning]] and [[soil]] or [[environmental protection]], as well as in property and estate management.

== Examples ==

The [[World Bank]] defines sustainable land management as a process in a charged environment between [[environmental protection]] and the guarantee claim of [[ecosystem services]] on the one hand. On the other hand, it is about productivity of [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] with respect to [[demographic growth]] and increasing pressure in [[land consumption|land use]].

{{quote|SLM is defined as a knowledge-based procedure that helps integrate land, water, biodiversity, and environmental management (including input and output externalities) to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods. SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growing
population. Improper land management can lead to [[land degradation]] and a significant reduction in the productive and service (biodiversity niches, [[hydrology]], [[carbon sequestration]]) functions of watersheds and landscapes."&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;[https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/7132/366540PAPER0Su11PUBLIC0as0of0July71.txt?sequence=2 The World Bank (2006): Sustainable Land Management. Challenges, Opportunities, and Trade-offs. Washington, DC]&lt;/ref&gt;|The World Bank}}
  
The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) applies the term in a much wider context. Besides agriculture and forestry they include the mineral extraction sector, property and estate management.

{{quote|Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect. It covers all activities concerned with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can include farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|title=Land Administration Guideline. With Special Reference to Countries in Transition|publisher=UN Economic Commission for Europe, Geneva, ECE/HBP/96|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/documents/Publications/land.administration.guidelines.e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the course of national politics and programmes, few [[Europe]]an states use the terminology "sustainable land management". Here [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are to be mentioned, as both countries have agreed on sustainable land management with respect to climate change as part of their government programmes.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Australian Government – Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European context, the definition of the European Network for Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities (LUMASEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://urbact.eu/en/projects/metropolitan-governance/lumasec/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; may be used as a reference. It emphasizes the inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation on sustainable land management:  

{{quote|As management is the human activity meaning the action of people working together in the aim to accomplish desired goals, land use management is a process of managing use and development of land, in which spatial, sector-oriented and temporary aspects of urban policy are coordinated. Resources of land are used for different purposes, which may produce conflicts and competitions, and land use management has to see those purposes in an integrated way. Therefore, land management covers the debate about norms and visions driving the policy-making, sector-based planning both in the strategic and more operative time spans, spatial integration of sectoral issues, decision-making, budgeting, implementation of plans and decisions and the monitoring of results and evaluation of impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Vancutsem (LEAD Expert): 2008 Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Research examples==

Since 2010, the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) funds an international research program on "sustainable land management".&lt;ref&gt;Weith, T., Schulz, K., Gaasch, N., Seppelt, R., Werntze, A., Eppink, F. (2010): Towards Integration: Sustainable Land Management. A new German Research Funding Measure&lt;/ref&gt; Module A of the program investigates interactions between land management, [[climate change]], and ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Seppelt, R., Dormann, C., Eppink, F. V., Lautenbach, S., Schmidt, S. (2011): A quantitative review of ecosystem studies: Approaches, shortcomings and the road ahead, Journal of Applied Ecology&lt;/ref&gt; It includes projects operating in [[South America]], [[Africa]], Europe, [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]]. Module B seeks "innovative system solutions" in 13 projects with a Central European focus.

Furthermore, [[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative | the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative]] seeks to establish a cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management highlighting its economic benefits. This economic analysis will enable decision makers to take appropriate measures combat [[land degradation]] globally. Additionally, the Initiative supports regional case studies focusing on [[Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].

'''''The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course''''' is a 2002 Australian-American [[adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[nature documentary]] television series ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''. It stars [[Steve Irwin]] and his wife [[Terri Irwin]] and was directed by frequent Irwin collaborator [[John Stainton]]. The film was released in between the fourth and fifth seasons of the series. The film follows Steve and Terri who attempt to save a [[crocodile]] from "poachers" not knowing that the two men are actually American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents who are after them because the crocodile in the Irwins' possession has accidentally swallowed an important satellite tracking beacon.

The film was theatrically released on 12 July 2002 in the U.S. by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which used a crocodile in place of the usual [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] for its title credit logo sequence. The film earned $33.4 million on a $12 million budget.

==Plot==
In outer space, a United States-owned [[satellite]] blows up and one of the last remaining pieces, a beacon, is sent hurdling towards Earth where it lands in Australia, only to be swallowed by a crocodile. Back at the CIA, Agent Buckwhiler and Deputy Director Reynolds reveal that, in the wrong hands, the beacon can change the axis of power in the world, so they send two agents, Robert Wheeler and Vaughn Barcher, down to Australia to retrieve the beacon. Department Director Ansell also secretly hires an operative of his own, Jo Buckley, to go and retrieve the beacon before Wheeler and Archer, so Ansell can take Reynolds' job.

In Australia, the crocodile that swallowed the beacon lives in a river next to the house of Brozzie Drewitt, an obnoxious [[cattle station]] owner who is taking it in her own hands to kill the crocodile for preying on her cattle. Because of this, the Department of Fauna and Fisheries send one of its workers, Sam Flynn, to Drewitt's house. Sam attempts to convince Brozzie to hire some professionals to relocate the animal, instead of having her kill it, which is illegal. Despite Flynn's words, Brozzie attempts to kill the crocodile later that night, only to fail.

Meanwhile, the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and his wife Terri are filming a [[documentary]] about the "less-lovable of Australia's [[wildlife]]" when they are hired by Flynn to relocate the crocodile that has been bothering Brozzie. Steve successfully gets the crocodile in his boat. Wheeler and Barcher are nearby using GPS technology to track the beacon. When the two agents see Steve and Terri zoom past them in their boat with the crocodile who swallowed the beacon on board, they are convinced that the Irwins have the beacon. They call up the CIA, who believe the Irwins plan to use the beacon to pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion to [[Australia Zoo]]. Steve and Terri board up the crocodile in a crate and put it in the back of the truck to drive to a new river system. Wheeler and Barcher follow them from behind in a Land Rover, and when Wheeler hops on the top of the Irwins' truck, Steve believes them to be [[poacher]]s who are after the crocodile. Steve climbs up on the roof and, after a brief fistfight, manages to knock Wheeler off the truck. When the Irwins reach the river, Steve opens the crocodile's crate and discovers that the crocodile had defecated. In the poop, Steve sees a shiny metal object (the beacon) which he mistakes to be a misproperly discarded children's spinning top toy. Steve and Terri successfully get the crocodile in the river, but Wheeler and Barcher show up again in a boat, determined to get the beacon. Jo Buckley shows up in an [[ultralight]] and throws sticks of [[dynamite]] down on Wheeler and BArcher's boat, destroying it and knocking the two agents in the river. Steve believes that he and Terri are caught up in the middle of a "poacher war" and, not wanting the dynamite to hurt the newly relocated crocodile, gets a rope out of the boat and lassoes the aircraft, causing it to crash in the river and seemingly kill Buckley. It turns out Buckley did survive and she swims to shore to inform Ansell via a phone call that she failed to retrieve the beacon. Ansell informs Buckley that he is on the run from the CIA and the police for hiring her for the mission. He is found by police and is arrested for his crimes, ending the phone call.

Due to Wheeler and Barcher's failure to retrieve the beacon, the CIA decides that it is time for drastic measures and they call up U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] in the [[White House]] to request permission to use military helicopters to fly to Australia and get the beacon.

Steve is ending his documentary by throwing the beacon in the air, when the military helicopters arrive. Steve hands them the beacon revealing that the whole predicament was a misunderstanding, and, in return, the CIA send Wheeler and Barcher to work at the zoo as volunteers. Brozzie becomes a volunteer for the Department of Fauna and Fisheries.

==Production==
Due to the series' immense popularity, director/producer Stainton had developed an idea for a feature-length ''Crocodile Hunter'' film in 1999 while shooting a documentary in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.com/articles/1167/crocodile-hunter-collision-course-the-production-notes.phtml Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, The: Production Notes] retrieved: 31 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to make a good film, but, at the same time, make it easy for Steve who was not used to acting, believing that Irwin should only play himself. It was Stainton's idea to film Steve and Terri doing a traditional nature documentary in the [[Australian Outback]] and film these scenes in a 1:85 screen ratio. In fact, nothing for the "documentary" scenes were ever scripted, and when the actors (from the scripted dramatic scenes that use a 2:40 screen ratio) entered the Irwins' world for a few brief scenes, Steve (who did not know anything about the script or plot) was informed by Stainton what was about to happen so Irwin could prepare and ad-lib as much as he wanted or needed. [[Cheyenne Enterprises]], a film and television production company owned by  [[Bruce Willis]] and producer Arnold Rifkin showed interest in producing and helping finance the project. MGM then showed interest in distributing the film worldwide and principal photography began in November 2001, after having filmed the non-scripted documentary segments for well over a year. The Irwins came across hundreds of animals for the filming of the documentary scenes, but only a few, the kangaroo, the perentie, the bird eating spider, and two snakes made it into the film. The animals they encountered were re-written into the script by Holly Goldberg-Sloan for the dramatic scenes when Wheeler and Archer encounter the Irwins' truck.

==Film aspect ratios==
''Collision Course'' was shot in two film [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|aspect ratios]], 1.85:1 for the scenes with Steve and Terri and 2.35:1 for the plot about the Australian farmer and the CIA and their efforts to find the tracking drone. In theaters and on DVD, the 1.85:1 image appears with [[Pillar box (film)|pillar boxing]], a format usually reserved for 1.33:1 ratio content appearing within 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 frames.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On the Fullscreen versions, the windowboxing (mostly in the scenes with Steve and Terri and the finale) is not present due to the fullscreen process cropping the widescreen image to the 1.33:1 ratio, causing the windowboxing borders not to be shown, even when shown on a widescreen television if the image is stretched as per fullscreen programs usually are.

==Reception==

=== Critical reaction ===
The film holds a 53% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 88 reviews.&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoesCollision&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_crocodile_hunter_collision_course_2002/?search=the%20crocodile%20hunter|title=The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course|date=12 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars, stating "You see a couple of likable people journeying through the outback, encountering dangerous critters and getting too close for comfort, while lecturing us on their habits and dangers and almost being killed by them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-crocodile-hunter-collision-course-2002|title=The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course|author=Roger Ebert|date=12 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert K. Elder of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said, "Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free."&lt;ref name="movies.yahoo.com"&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;id=1807879064&amp;cf=critic Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course – Movie Reviews – Yahoo Movies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Superclass List''''' is a creation of [[David Rothkopf]] which his book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and The World They Are Making]]'' (publ. March 2008) is based upon. There are four key elements of success that unite the members of the Superclass, and gives them unparalleled power over world affairs. These elements are: ''geography'', ''pedigree'', ''networking'' and ''luck''.&lt;ref name=global&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/24830-business|title=The New 'Superclass' – Hype -vs- Reality|last=Latif|first=Iqbal|date=2008-01-06|work=Global Politician|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC right}}

==The verified list==
In the book Rothkopf writes that his list from 2008 contains 6,000 individuals. The grouping is, however, only defined roughly and as a statistical reality. Rothkopf also writes that list  (one in a million, [[world population|globally]]), is always in flux. (Note, world population is now 6.9 - 7 billion. so, if published today, the list may contain 7,000 names)

Rothkopf states that his list is not to be shown in public as there will be so much discussion about who does or does not qualify to be on the list. In interviews he mentions individuals that are on the list. This list contain names that he argues he has verified.

The '''Think Before You Speak''' campaign is a television, radio, and magazine advertising campaign launched in 2008 and developed to raise awareness of the common use of derogatory vocabulary among [[youth]] towards [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[queer]]/[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) people.&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt; It also aims to "raise awareness about the prevalence and consequences of anti-LGBTQ bias and behaviour in America’s schools."&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-Homophobia Campaign Slaps Gamers: You've got to admit, it's got a point." Super Players On-line Gamebase (''SPOnG News''), August 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As LGBTQ people have become more accepted in the mainstream culture more studies have confirmed that they are one of the most targeted groups for harassment and bullying. An "analysis of 14 years of hate crime data" by the [[FBI]] found that gays and lesbians, or those perceived to be gay, "are far more likely to be victims of a violent hate crime than any other minority group in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splcs-intelligence-report-gays-targeted-for-hate-crimes SPLC’s Intelligence Report: Gays Targeted for Hate Crimes Far More Than Any Other Minority in America], November 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irmp"&gt;Mark Potok, [http://splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/under-attack-gays-remain-minority-mos "Gays Remain Minority Most Targeted by Hate Crimes"], ''Intelligence Report'', Winter 2010, Issue Number: 140.&lt;/ref&gt; “As Americans become more accepting of LGBT people, the most extreme elements of the anti-gay movement are digging in their heels and continuing to defame gays and lesbians with falsehoods that grow more incendiary by the day,” said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report. “The leaders of this movement may deny it, but it seems clear that their demonization of gays and lesbians plays a role in fomenting the violence, hatred and bullying we’re seeing.”&lt;ref name="irmp"/&gt; Because of their [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]/expression, nearly half of LGBTQ students have been physically assaulted at school.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Biglow, "LGBT activists say: 'That's so gay' is so very passe", ''The Corsair'', May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuarte"/&gt; The campaign takes positive steps to counteract hateful and anti-gay speech that LGBTQ students experience in their daily lives in hopes to de-escalate the cycle of hate speech/harassment/bullying/physical threats and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Greenblatt, ''Serving LGBTIQ Library and Archives Users: Essays on Outreach, Service, Collections and Access'', McFarland, 2010, {{ISBN|0-7864-4894-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4894-4}}, pages 71-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A U.S. government study, titled ''Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide'', published in 1989, found that [[LGBT]] youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED334503&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED334503 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide]&lt;/ref&gt; This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to [[Minority Stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10851 |title=Definition of Bisexual suicide risk |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Meyer IH |title=Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: conceptual issues and research evidence |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=5 |pages=674–97 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12956539 |pmc=2072932 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] and drug use among LGBT people have both been shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/3/452 |title=The Impact of Institutional Discrimination on Psychiatric Disorders in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: A Prospective Study by Mark L.

Hasin, PhD |publisher=Ajph.aphapublications.org |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionalized and internalized [[homophobia]] may also lead LGBTQ youth to not accept themselves and have deep internal conflicts about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. (1989), “Gay and Lesbian Youth Suicide”, in Fenleib, Marcia R. (ed.), Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, United States Government Printing Office, {{ISBN|0-16-002508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Approximately 25 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students and university employees have been harassed due to their sexual orientation, as well as a third of those who identify as transgender, according to the study and reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/15/lgbt-students-harassed-at_n_717992.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Danielle | last=Wienerbronner | title=LGBT Students Harassed At Colleges Nationwide, New Report Says | date=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say that they do not feel safe at school (22% vs. 7%) and 90% of LGBT students (vs. 62% of non-LGBT teens) have been harassed or assaulted during the past year." &lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts About Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101035436/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "LGBQ students were more likely than heterosexual students to have seriously considered leaving their institution as a result of harassment and discrimination."&lt;ref name="Herald 2010"&gt;{{cite news|author=The Miami Herald |url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2010/09/college-study-reveals-chilly-campus-climate-toward-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-people.html |title=Steve Rothaus' Gay South Florida |publisher=Miamiherald.typepad.com |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Rankin, a contributing author to the report in Miami, found that “Unequivocally, The 2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People demonstrates that LGBTQ students, faculty and staff experience a ‘chilly’ campus climate of harassment and far less than welcoming campus communities."&lt;ref name="Herald 2010" /&gt;

Homophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to [[bullying]]. As seen in the nine LGBTQ youth suicides in September 2010, severe bullying can lead to extremities such as [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Badash |url=http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/septembers-anti-gay-bullying-suicides-there-were-a-lot-more-than-5/discrimination/2010/10/01/13297 |title=September's Anti-Gay Bullying Suicides - There Were A Lot More Than 5 |publisher=Thenewcivilrightsmovement.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not always have to be physical, but it can be emotional, viral, sexual, and racial, too. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other [[verbal abuse]]. Viral, or [[cyber bullying]], involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other [[social media]] networks. Sexual bullying is unwanted touching, lewd gestures or jokes, and racial bullying has to do with [[stereotypes]] and [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article234752.ece |title=Students learn about bullying |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901182900/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article234752.ece |archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying is often dismissed as a "[[rite of passage]]", but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. "Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals", and "almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)", according to [[GLSEN]]'s ''Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation’s Schools''.&lt;ref name="thetrevorproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101035436/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues have become more mainstream in the 2000s (decade), and even more so in the months of September and October 2010 when a series of suicides got national attention. In August 2010 the [[US Department of Education]] (DOE) hosted the first-ever [[National Bullying Summit]].&lt;ref name="cnnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/10/obama.bullying/index.html |first=Shawna |last=Shepherd |title=White House conference tackles bullying |publisher=CNN |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] has posted an "It Gets Better" video on [[The White House]] website as part of the [[It Gets Better Project]], it became the second most-viewed video on the White House YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="cnnn"/&gt;

"More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year," making it "the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers."&lt;ref name="thetrevorproject.org"/&gt; In 2004, 1,985 American adolescents under the age of twenty committed suicide, an increase of 18% from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-02-05-kids-suicides_x.htm | work=USA Today | first=Lindsey | last=Tanner | title=Kids' suicides rise, CDC report finds | date=February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is impossible to know the exact suicide rate of LGBT youth because sexuality and gender minorities are often hidden and even unknown, particularly in this age group. Further research is currently being done to explain the prevalence of [[suicide among LGBT youth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youth.org/loco/PERSONProject/Resources/ResearchStudies/suicide2.html "Sexual Orientation and Youth Suicide"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104141541/http://www.youth.org/loco/PERSONProject/Resources/ResearchStudies/suicide2.html |date=2006-01-04 }} by Dr. Gary Remafedi, October 6, 1999, retrieved 2 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_146_37/ai_89942832 "Youth suicide risk and sexual orientation - Statistical Data Included"] by Rutter, Philip A &amp; Soucar, Emil, Summer 2002, retrieved 2 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gaysuic.htm Articles Relating to Suicide by GLB Youth], retrieved 3 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

GLSEN spent approximately $2 million dollars to produce the campaign, which was released along with GLSEN's ''2007 School Climate Survey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/2008/10/think-before-you-speak/|title=Think Before You Speak |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes three television [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), six print PSAs and three radio PSAs.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Zappala, Ann R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9445">'''Trading diasporas''' is a term coined by [[Philip D. Curtin]] to mean: “communities of merchants living among aliens in associated networks”.&lt;ref&gt;Gosch, Steve. "Cross Cultural Trade as a Framework for Teaching World History: Concepts and Applications." ''The History Teacher'' 27, no. 4 (1994): 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Trading [[diaspora]]s were formed as a result of [[international trade]] that resulted in the settlement of [[merchant]]s in certain countries where they sold their products. Their importance to the global world was marked by their impact on the spread of cultures and ideologies of certain areas to the rest of the world. First mention of trading diasporas dates back around 2000 BCE when the [[Assyria]]n merchants traveled to the [[Anatolian Peninsula]] in order to sell their goods.&lt;ref&gt;Gosch, 427&lt;/ref&gt; Trading diasporas in this period of time were created as a result of the Assyrian traders staying as “semi-permanent residents” in cities of the Anatolian peninsula. According to Steve Gosch of the [[University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire]] divides the Assyrian traders into “stayers” and “movers.”&lt;ref&gt;Gosch , 428&lt;/ref&gt; Gosch further explains that “stayers” were the merchants who permanently settled on the [[Anatolian peninsula]] while “movers” traveled back and forth in order to sell their goods.

According to Jane Schneider, the [[merchants]] trading prior to 15th century were able to create “[[asymmetrical]] links between world regions.”&lt;ref name="Gosch , 429"&gt;Gosch , 429&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Gillis]] and [[Andre Gunder Frank]] go on to say that “the earliest world system contained the essential features of its modern counterpart: asymmetrical relationships between regions in the core and periphery, continuing struggles for [[hegemony]] within the core and alternating periods of expansion and contraction in the system as a whole.”&lt;ref name="Gosch , 429"/&gt; This means that the relations between different regions in the early modern world were not perfect and differed from the international relations of the modern time. Trading diasporas were able to create cultural and economical ties with different regions rather than a political relationship.

==Causes==
There are several reasons for the creation of trading diasporas some of which included a demand for products that were not available in particular regions of the world, the division of the world into small [[city states]] who wanted to create economic and cultural ties with the rest of the world and the willingness of people living in certain areas to create their communities abroad and to be represented by them. As Gosch explains “[[premodern]] world system was to some extent an “[[archipelago]] of towns" in which [[Urban area|urban]] centers in [[Europe]] ([[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]), the [[Middle East]] ([[Cairo]], [[Aden]], and [[Hormuz, Iran|Hormuz]]), and [[Asia]] ([[Samarkand]], [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kanchipuram]], [[Malacca]], [[Quanzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]]) were connected to one another by trade and shared in a common culture of [[commerce]].”&lt;ref name="Gosch , 429"/&gt; Strong empires like [[China]] and several [[European states]] were also using the merchants to create trading diasporas in order to gather information about a certain country and possibly exploit it either in the event of conflict or just for sociable reasons. Long distance trade at this time mainly “dealt largely if not exclusively with [[luxury goods]] or high value relative to their bulk.”&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Jerry H. "Cross Cultural interaction and [[Periodization]] in [[World History]]." ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' 101, no. 3 (1996): 752.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, protection of trading diasporas in the countries where diasporas settled was important as it guaranteed supply of [[luxury good|luxury]] products into the country.

==Jewish diaspora==
The [[Jewish diaspora]] in [[India]] in an area called [[Goa]] is considered one of the oldest and strongest of the Early Modern World diasporas. The [[human migration|migration]] of [[Jews]] to [[India]] can be marked by the discovery of the route to [[India]] through the South African coast by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischel, Walter J. "Leading [[Jews]] in the Service of Portuguese [[India]]." The Jewish quarterly review 47, no. 1 (1956): 37&lt;/ref&gt; As Walter Fischel, the author of Leading [[Jews]] in the service of Portuguese [[India]] notes “Already in 1498 there appeared in the vicinity of [[Goa]] on the island of [[Anjediva]] the first Western [[Jew]] to play a role in the Portuguese [[India]]n history.”&lt;ref name="Fischel , 38"&gt;Fischel , 38&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the diamond trade, [[Jews]] in [[Portugal]] were employed as [[letter carriers]], [[translators]] and agents.&lt;ref name="Fischel , 38"/&gt; As the Portuguese expansion in [[India]] continued, [[Jews]] were able to create their own communities and practice their [[religious traditions]]. As [[Netherlands|Dutch]] traveler J. Van Linschoten noted “There are great numbers of Moores and [[Jews]] in all places of [[India]] as at [[Goa]], [[Cochin]] and within the land… amongst the [[India]]ns they have their [[Synagogues]]… wherein they use all ceremonies according to their law.”&lt;ref&gt;Fischel , 39&lt;/ref&gt; Linschoten’s statement clearly explains that Spanish Muslims–[[Moors]] and [[Jews]] were able to practice their religions in [[India]]. This meant that they were able to create communities within the [[India]]n peninsula and preserve their culture and religion. Such cases strongly suggest that rather than living like [[India]]ns, [[Jews]] created diasporas which helped them preserve their identity. [[Jews]] in [[India]] were able to trade and practice their religion unlike in [[Europe]], where they were oppressed and killed. This meant that “a [[Jew]] could rise to power and prominence in public life and could become an agent and diplomat in the service of the Portuguese viceroy in [[Goa]].”&lt;ref&gt;Fischel , 40&lt;/ref&gt;

As Fischel states [[Jews]] were also used by the Portuguese to negotiate with the [[Muslim]] rulers of [[India]]. This was due to the “skill, knowledge and linguistic abilities of non-Christians.”&lt;ref&gt;Fischel , 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surat==
[[Surat]] was a city in [[Gujarat]] which at the time of the Portuguese conquest on the northern shores of [[India]] became one of the most important trading centers of [[Asia]]. Jewish diaspora was closely related to [[Surat]] as [[Jewish]] [[merchants]] plied their [[commerce]] through [[Surat]]. They, for the most part were jewelers and [[diamond]] merchants.&lt;ref name="Fischel, 47"&gt;Fischel, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

“They came from many parts of the world, from [[Constantinople]], [[Safed]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[England]], as well as from [[Yemen]], [[Persia]] and Jewish [[colony]] at [[Cochin]]–all attracted by the great economic potential and possibilities of [[Surat]].”&lt;ref name="Fischel, 47"/&gt; Therefore, [[Surat]] can be considered to be one of the largest centers of Jewish trading and diaspora.

==Significance==
Trading diasporas were important in a way that they were crucial in a process of establishing long-distance trade, “transfers of [[technology]], imperial and [[colonialism|colonial]] ventures, [[missionary]] campaigns, the [[transatlantic slave trade]], and the development of global [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, p.752&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, trading diasporas were not always a positive community as it led to the establishment of the [[slave trade]] and [[colonialism]].{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} However, the interaction between the different nations and long distance trade which was made possible by the existence of trading diasporas was an important vanguard as it led to the development of [[global markets]]. In addition to the development of [[global markets]] trading diasporas also triggered an exchange of [[cultures]], ideas and [[technology]] between the host country and the [[merchant]].

{{Transhumanism}}

'''Transhumanism''' (abbreviated as '''H+''' or '''h+''') is an international [[school of thought|philosophical movement]] that advocates for the transformation of the [[human condition]] by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly [[human enhancement|enhance human]] intellect and physiology.&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religion and Transhumanism: The Unknown Future of Human Enhancement|last = Mercer|first = Calvin|publisher = Praeger|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bostrom | first=Nick | authorlink = Nick Bostrom |title = A history of transhumanist thought|journal = [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/history.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of [[emerging technologies]] that could overcome fundamental human limitations as well as the [[technoethics|ethical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/fuller20150909|title=We May Look Crazy to Them, But They Look Like Zombies to Us: Transhumanism as a Political Challenge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; limitations of using such technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Techno-human Shell-A Jump in the Evolutionary Gap | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1620061657}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of [[posthuman#Transhumanism|posthuman]] beings.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

The contemporary meaning of the term "transhumanism" was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of [[Futures studies|futurology]], [[FM-2030]], who taught "new concepts of the human" at [[The New School]] in the 1960s, when he began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and [[worldview]]s "transitional" to posthumanity as                  "[[transhuman]]".&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; The assertion would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher [[Max More]] to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a [[futurist]] philosophy in 1990, and organizing in [[California]] an [[intelligentsia]] that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelles 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=transhumanism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctranshumanism%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by seminal works of [[science fiction]], the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives, including philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

==History==
===Precursors of transhumanism===
According to [[Nick Bostrom]], [[Self-transcendence|transcendentalist]] impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for [[immortality]] in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], as well as in historical quests for the [[Fountain of Youth]], the [[Elixir of Life]], and other efforts to stave off aging and death.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

There is debate about whether the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]] can be considered an influence on transhumanism, despite its exaltation of the "[[Übermensch]]" (overman or superman), due to its emphasis on [[self-actualization]] rather than technological transformation.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackford 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2012"/&gt; The transhumanist philosophies of [[Max More]] and [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]] have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking.&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2009"/&gt; By way of contrast, The Transhumanist Declaration&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002"/&gt; ''"...advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in artificial intellects, humans, posthumans, or non-human animals)".

The late 19th to early 20th century movement known as [[Russian cosmism]] also incorporated some ideas which later developed into the core of the transhumanist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013|title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

===Early transhumanist thinking===
[[File:Hux-Oxon-72.jpg|thumb|150x200px|left|[[Julian Huxley]], the biologist who popularised the term ''transhumanism'' in an influential 1957 essay.]]
Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in his essay ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future|Daedalus: Science and the Future]]'', which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion, "indecent and unnatural". In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of [[eugenics]], [[ectogenesis]] (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics, such as health and intelligence.

His article inspired academic and popular interest. [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]], a crystallographer at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], wrote ''The World, the Flesh and the Devil'' in 1929, in which he speculated on the prospects of [[space colonization]] and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through [[bionics|bionic implants]] and [[cognitive enhancement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|title=Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds|publisher=St Martin's Griffin, New York|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005" /&gt;

The biologist [[Julian Huxley]] is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article. The term itself, however, derives from an earlier 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W. D. Lighthall.&lt;ref name="Harrison and Wolyniak 2015"/&gt; Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms:
{{blockquote|Up till now human life has generally been, as Hobbes described it, 'nasty, brutish and short'; the great majority of human beings (if they have not already died young) have been afflicted with misery… we can justifiably hold the belief that these lands of possibility exist, and that the present limitations and miserable frustrations of our existence could be in large measure surmounted… The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"/&gt;}}

&lt;!-- [[File:2001 NAL.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', published in 1968, which deals with the transhumanist agenda.]]
 --&gt;Huxley's definition differs, albeit not substantially, from the one commonly in use since the 1980s. The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the [[science fiction]] of the 1960s, notably in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/163072-googles-glass-castle-the-rise-and-fear-of-a-transhuman-future/|title=Google's Glass Castle: The Rise and Fear of a Transhuman Future|author=Christopher Hutton|publisher=PopMatters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese [[Metabolist]] architects produced a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to "encourage active metabolic development of our society"&lt;ref&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; through design and technology. In the [[Metabolism (architecture)#Material and Man|Material and Man]] section of the manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that:&lt;blockquote&gt;After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a “brain wave receiver” in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa. What I think will be known by all the people. There is no more individual consciousness, only the will of mankind as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kenzo Tange and the Metabolist Movement: Urban Utopias of Modern Japan|last = Lin|first = Zhongjie|publisher = Routledge|year = 2010|isbn = 9781135281984|location = |pages = 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity===
The concept of the [[technological singularity]], or the ultra-rapid advent of superhuman intelligence, was first proposed by the British [[cryptologist]] [[I. J. Good]] in 1965:
{{blockquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.&lt;ref&gt;I.J. Good, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090420061605/http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Good-IJ/SCtFUM.html "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine"] ([http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/pages/ultraintelligentmachine.html HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085512/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf |date=November 28, 2011 }}), ''Advances in Computers'', vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Computer science|Computer scientist]] [[Marvin Minsky]] wrote on relationships between human and [[artificial intelligence]] beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Minsky 1960"/&gt; Over the succeeding decades, this field continued to generate influential thinkers such as [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Raymond Kurzweil]], who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein.&lt;ref name="Moravec 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 1999"/&gt; The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century. In 1966, [[FM-2030]] (formerly F. M. Esfandiary), a [[futurist]] who taught "new concepts of the human" at [[The New School]], in [[New York City]], began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and world views transitional to [[posthumanity]] as "[[transhuman]]".&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1989"/&gt; In 1972, [[Robert Ettinger]] contributed to the conceptualization of "transhumanity" in his book ''Man into Superman.''&lt;ref name="Ettinger 1972" /&gt; FM-2030 published the ''Upwingers Manifesto'' in 1973.&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1973" /&gt;

===Growth of transhumanism===
The first self-described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], which became the main center of transhumanist thought. Here, [[FM-2030]] lectured on his "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" futurist ideology.&lt;ref name="FM-2030: Are You Transhuman" /&gt; At the [[EZTV (media company)|EZTV]] Media venue, frequented by transhumanists and other futurists, [[Natasha Vita-More]] presented ''Breaking Away'', her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth's gravity as they head into space.&lt;ref name="EZTV Media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over the Edge"/&gt; FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], which included students from FM-2030's courses and audiences from Vita-More's artistic productions. In 1982, Vita-More authored the ''Transhumanist Arts Statement''&lt;ref name="Vita-More 1982"/&gt; and, six years later, produced the cable TV show ''TransCentury Update ''on transhumanity, a program which reached over 100,000 viewers.

In 1986, [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] published ''[[Engines of Creation]]: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology,''&lt;ref name="Drexler 1986"/&gt; which discussed the prospects for [[nanotechnology]] and [[molecular assembler]]s, and founded the [[Foresight Institute]]. As the first non-profit organization to research, advocate for, and perform [[cryonics]], the Southern California offices of the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]] became a center for futurists. In 1988, the first issue of ''Extropy Magazine'' was published by [[Max More]] and Tom Morrow. In 1990, More, a strategic philosopher, created his own particular transhumanist doctrine, which took the form of the ''Principles of Extropy,'' and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition:&lt;ref name="More 1990"/&gt;

{{blockquote|Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism, including a respect for reason and science, a commitment to progress, and a valuing of human (or transhuman) existence in this life. [...] Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies [...].}}

In 1992, More and Morrow founded the [[Extropy Institute]], a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new [[memeplex]]es by organizing a series of conferences and, more importantly, providing a mailing list, which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of [[cyberculture]] and the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture. In 1998, philosophers [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] founded the [[World Transhumanist Association]] (WTA), an international non-governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of [[scientific inquiry]] and [[Policy|public policy]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt; In 2002, the WTA modified and adopted ''The Transhumanist Declaration.''&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002"/&gt; ''The Transhumanist FAQ'', prepared by the WTA (later [[Humanity+]]), gave two formal definitions for transhumanism:&lt;ref name="What is Transhumanism"/&gt;
{{blockquote|
# The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.
# The study of the ramifications, promises, and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations, and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies.}}

In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations, WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their [[futurist]] visions and needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name = "Hughes 2004"/&gt; A particular concern is the equal access to [[human enhancement]] technologies across classes and borders.&lt;ref name="Utne"/&gt; In 2006, a [[transhumanist politics|political struggle]] within the transhumanist movement between the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] and the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal left]] resulted in a more [[centre-left]]ward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]].&lt;ref name="Utne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Among the Transhumanists" /&gt; In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization, stating that its mission was "essentially completed".&lt;ref name="Extropy Institute 2006" /&gt; This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization. In 2008, as part of a rebranding effort, the WTA changed its name to "[[Humanity+]]".&lt;ref name="Newitz 2008" /&gt; In 2012, the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension, that for now has more than 30 national organisations throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stambler |first=Ilia |title=The Longevity Party – Who Needs it?

The [[Mormon Transhumanist Association]] was founded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/ |work=Mormon Transhumanist Association |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, it consisted of hundreds of members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Member Survey Results |url=http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/member-survey-results/ |work=Mormon Transhumanist Association |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first transhumanist elected member of a Parliament has been [[Giuseppe Vatinno]], in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/italy-elects-first-transhumanist-mp |title=Italy elects first transhumanist MP |publisher=Kurzweilai.net |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
{{See also|Outline of transhumanism}}
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of [[posthumanism]] and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism. The latter is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its [[Conservatism|conservative]],&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2004"/&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]]&lt;ref name="Hook 2004"/&gt; and [[Progressivism|progressive]]&lt;ref name="The Hedgehog Review 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coenen 2007"/&gt; critics.

A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and eventually will supplement or supersede it. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. [[biological uplift]]),&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004" /&gt; but clings to a "posthuman future" as the final goal of participant evolution.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2006"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bostrom | first = Nick | title = Why I Want to be a Posthuman When I Grow Up | url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/posthuman.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the idea of creating [[artificial intelligence|intelligent artificial beings]] (proposed, for example, by roboticist [[Hans Moravec]]) has influenced transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Moravec 1998" /&gt; Moravec's ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a "complacent" or "[[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]]" variant of posthumanism and contrasted with "[[cultural posthumanism]]" in [[humanities]] and [[the arts]].&lt;ref name="Cultural Critique 2003" /&gt; While such a "cultural posthumanism" would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the "[[Agency (philosophy)|autonomous liberal subject]]", but are expanding its "[[prerogative]]s" into the realm of the [[posthuman]].&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999" /&gt; Transhumanist self-characterisations as a continuation of [[humanism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking correspond with this view.

Some [[Secular humanism|secular humanists]] conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist [[freethought]] movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns (i.e. [[technocentrism]]) and on the issue of [[death|mortality]].&lt;ref name="Inniss 1998" /&gt; However, other progressives have argued that posthumanism, whether it be its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about [[social justice]], from the [[social change|reform of human institutions]] and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] longings for a [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] of the human body in quest of more [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|exquisite]] ways of being.&lt;ref name="Winner 2005" /&gt;

As an alternative, humanist philosopher Dwight Gilbert Jones has proposed a renewed Renaissance humanism through DNA and genome repositories, with each individual genotype (DNA) being instantiated as successive phenotypes (bodies or lives via cloning, ''Church of Man'', 1978). In his view, native molecular DNA "continuity" is required for retaining the "self" and no amount of computing power or memory aggregation can replace the essential "stink" of our true genetic identity, which he terms "[http://genity.org/ genity]". Instead, DNA/genome stewardship by an institution analogous to the Jesuits' 400 year vigil is a suggested model for enabling humanism to become our species' common credo, a project he proposed in his speculative novel ''The Humanist – 1000 Summers'' (2011), wherein humanity dedicates these coming centuries to harmonizing our planet and peoples.

The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to [[technoself studies]], an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Public Affairs and Administration: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S51CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2192|year=2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-8359-4|page=2192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aims ===
[[File:PPTCountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg|thumb|300px| Ray Kurzweil believes that a countdown to when "human life will be irreversibly transformed" can be made through plotting major world events on a graph.]]
While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply [[reason]], science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty, disease, disability and malnutrition around the globe,&lt;ref name="What is Transhumanism" /&gt; transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]], while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating [[Congenital disorder|congenital mental and physical barriers]].

Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist ethical imperative]] for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a [[transhuman]] phase of existence in which humans [[human enhancement|enhance themselves]] beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or [[directed evolution]].

Some theorists such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] think that the [[Accelerating change|pace of technological innovation is accelerating]] and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a [[technological singularity]], which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt; Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on [[existential risk]]s to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"/&gt;

While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality, it is not necessarily true. Hank Pellissier, managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (2011–2012), surveyed transhumanists. He found that, of the 818 respondents, 23.8% did not want immortality.&lt;ref name="Pellissier, Hank 2012"&gt;Pellissier, Hank. "Do all Transhumanists Want Immortality? No? Why Not?" Futurist 46.6 (2012): 65-. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons argued were boredom, Earth's overpopulation and the desire "to go to an afterlife".&lt;ref name="Pellissier, Hank 2012"/&gt;

=== Empathic fallibility and conversational consent ===
{{See also|Uplift (science fiction)}}
Certain transhumanist philosophers hold that since all assumptions about what others experience [[fallibility|are fallible]], and that therefore all attempts to help or protect beings that are not capable of correcting what others assume about them no matter how well-intentioned are in danger of actually hurting them, all [[sentience|sentient]] beings deserve to be [[sapience|sapient]]. These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a [[falsifiability|falsification-based]] way constitutes a [[critical phenomena|threshold that is not arbitrary]] at which it becomes possible for an individual to speak for themself in a way that is not dependent on exterior assumptions. They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it, typically stating that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the [[brain]]'s ability to discriminate. This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity in order to shorten or ideally skip non-sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself. Transhumanists of this description stress that the genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells, and not purging of individuals without the modifications, deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Human Purpose and Transhuman Potential: A Cosmic Vision of Our Future Evolution, Ted Chu 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The thinker's guide to ethical reasoning, Linda Elder and Richard Paul 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Think about Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age Theodore Schick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ten Billion Tomorrows: How Science Fiction Technology Became Reality and Shapes the Future, Brian Clegg 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Humanism}}
Transhumanists engage in [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on [[futurology]] and various fields of ethics.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Unlike many philosophers, social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of [[nature|natural]] systems, transhumanists see the very concept of the specifically [[Appeal to nature|natural]] as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst.&lt;ref name="Bostrom, Sandberg 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom, Nick]] &amp; [[Anders Sandberg|Sandberg, Anders]]| title = The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement| year = 2007| url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, refer to transhumanism's critics, on the political right and left jointly, as "[[Bioconservatism|bioconservatives]]" or "[[neo-luddism|bioluddites]]", the latter term alluding to the 19th century [[luddite|anti-industrialisation]] social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;

A belief of counter-transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life, but specifically on the social plane. This can be compared to steroid use, where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not. The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects.&lt;ref name="Tennison 2012"/&gt;

=== Currents ===
There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought. Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development.&lt;ref name="WTA FAQ 5.2"/&gt; Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order:
* [[Democratic transhumanism]], a political ideology synthesizing [[liberal democracy]], [[social democracy]], [[radical democracy]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes A2002"/&gt;
*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326693925_Extrapolitical_Theory_and_Postpoliticism Postpoliticism],  a transhumanist political proposal that aims to create a Postdemocratic state based on reason and free access of enhancement technologies to people. It tries to overcome the four traditional political theories (liberalism, socialism, nationalism, conservatism) while adding the best, if had, of them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327756347_Extrapolitical_Theory_and_Postpoliticism_-_A_Transhumanist_Political_Theory|title=Extrapolitical Theory and Postpoliticism - A Transhumanist Political Theory|last=Gayozzo|first=Piero|date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Extropianism]], an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a [[Proactionary principle|proactive approach]] to human evolution.&lt;ref name="More 1990"/&gt;
* [[Immortalism]], a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical [[life extension]] and [[Immortality#Technological immortality|technological immortality]] is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization.&lt;ref name="imminst"/&gt;
* [[Libertarian transhumanism]], a political ideology synthesizing [[libertarianism]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;
* [[Postgenderism]], a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of [[gender]] in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and [[reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008" /&gt;
* Prometheism, a pro-nazi and fascist transhumanist proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm|title=The Politics of Transhumanism|website=www.changesurfer.com|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Singularitarianism]], a moral ideology based upon the belief that a [[technological singularity]] is possible, and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005" /&gt;
* [[Technogaianism]], an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth's environment and that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should therefore be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes A2002" /&gt;

=== Spirituality ===
Although many transhumanists are [[atheism|atheists]], [[agnosticism|agnostics]], and/or [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], some have [[religion|religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt; Despite the prevailing secular attitude, some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions, such as [[immortality]],&lt;ref name =imminst/&gt; while several controversial [[new religious movement]]s from the late 20th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to the alteration of the mind and body, such as [[Raëlism]].&lt;ref name="Rael 2002"/&gt; However, most thinkers associated with the transhumanist movement focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives, while speculating that future understanding of [[neurotheology]] and the application of [[neurotechnology]] will enable humans to gain greater control of [[altered states of consciousness]], which were commonly interpreted as [[spiritual experience]]s, and thus achieve more profound [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Hughes BH 2004"/&gt; Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist-derived meditation and mind expanding "neurotechnologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/cyborgbuddha|title=IEET Cyborg Buddha Project|work=ieet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness.&lt;ref name="Evans 2014"/&gt;

Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware, with the theoretical implication that human [[consciousness]] may someday be transferred to alternative media (a speculative technique commonly known as [[mind uploading]]).&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2000"/&gt; One extreme formulation of this idea, which some transhumanists are interested in, is the proposal of the [[Omega Point]] by Christian cosmologist [[Frank J. Tipler|Frank Tipler]]. Drawing upon ideas in [[Digital philosophy|digitalism]], Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the [[Universe]] billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a [[simulated reality]] within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of "[[posthuman God|posthuman godhood]]". Tipler's thought was inspired by the writings of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[Jesuit]] theologian who saw an evolutionary [[telos (philosophy)|telos]] in the development of an encompassing [[noosphere]], a global consciousness.&lt;ref name="tipler1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://jetpress.org/v20/steinhart.htm?pagewanted=all |title=Teilhard de Chardin and Transhumanism |author=Eric Steinhart |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=December 2008 |pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Transhumanism and Transcendence |author=Michael S. Burdett |page=20 |quote=...others have made important contributions as well. For example, Freeman Dyson and Frank Tipler in the twentieth century... |publisher=[[Georgetown University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-58901-780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewed from the perspective of some [[Christian]] thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a [[Transhumanism#Contempt for the flesh|denigration of the human body]], characteristic of [[gnostic]] manichaean belief.&lt;ref name="Pauls 2005"/&gt; Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as [[Gnosticism in modern times|neo-gnostic]] by non-Christian and secular commentators.&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 1999"/&gt;

The first dialogue between transhumanism and [[faith]] was a one-day conference held at the [[University of Toronto]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Walker 2005"/&gt; Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor a relationship with the [[divinity|divine]]. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of [[postmodern]] [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and [[anomie]]. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in [[optimistic]], idealistic attitudes that trace back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="TransVision 2004: Faith, Transhumanism and Hope Symposium"/&gt; Following this dialogue, [[William Sims Bainbridge]], a [[sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]], conducted a pilot study, published in the [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]], suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"/&gt;

Since 2006, the [[Mormon Transhumanist Association]] sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mormon Transhumanist Association |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/transfigurism |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[American Academy of Religion]] holds a "Transhumanism and Religion" consultation during its annual meeting, where scholars in the field of [[religious studies]] seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future, in particular the prospect of human transformation, whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology, robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species.&lt;ref name="AAR: Transhumanism and Religion Consultations"/&gt;

The physicist and transhumanist thinker [[Giulio Prisco]] states that "cosmist religions based on science, might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Turing Church | title=Religion as Protection From Reckless Pursuit of Superintelligence and Other Risky Technologies | date=September 9, 2014 | url=http://turingchurch.com/2014/09/09/religion-as-protection-from-reckless-pursuit-of-superintelligence-and-other-risky-technologies/ | author=Giulio Prisco | access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisco also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas, such as the ones of [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], to the origins of the transhumanism movement.

== Practice ==
While some transhumanists{{who|date=October 2014}} take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies, others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body, including heritable ones. Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human [[nervous system]]. Though some, such as [[Kevin Warwick]], propose modification of the [[peripheral nervous system]], the [[human brain|brain]] is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions.&lt;ref name="Walker 2002"/&gt;

In fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm in order to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted.&lt;ref name="doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369| pmid = 14568806| title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems| journal = Archives of Neurology| volume = 60| issue = 10| pages = 1369–73| year = 2003| last1 = Warwick | first1 = K. | last2 = Gasson | first2 = M. | last3 = Hutt | first3 = B. | last4 = Goodhew | first4 = I. | last5 = Kyberd | first5 = P. | last6 = Andrews | first6 = B. | last7 = Teddy | first7 = P. | last8 = Shad | first8 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As proponents of [[self-improvement]] and [[body modification]], including [[transitioning (transgender)|gender transitioning]], transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 1993"/&gt; Depending on their age, some{{who|date=October 2014}} transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in [[life extension]] strategies and in funding research in [[cryonics]] in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2004"/&gt; Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Technologies of interest ===
{{Main|Human enhancement technologies}}
[[File:Converging technologies.png|thumb|''Converging Technologies'', a 2002 report exploring the potential for synergy among nano-, bio-, info- and cogno-technologies, has become a landmark in near-future technological speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtec.org/ConvergingTechnologies/Report/welcome.htm |title=''Converging Technologies'' |publisher=Wtec.org |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Transhumanists support the [[emerging technologies|emergence]] and [[converging technologies|convergence]] of technologies including [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[cognitive science]] (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like [[simulated reality]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[superintelligence]], [[3D bioprinting]], [[mind uploading]], chemical brain preservation and [[cryonics]]. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become [[superhuman|more than human]].&lt;ref name="Naam 2005"/&gt; Therefore, they support the recognition and/or protection of [[cognitive liberty]], [[morphological freedom]] and [[procreative liberty]] as [[civil liberties]], so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using [[human enhancement technologies]] on themselves and their children.&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2001"/&gt; Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century. Kurzweil's book ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' and Michio Kaku's book ''[[Physics of the Future]]'' outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Physics of the Future|year=2011|publisher=Doubleday|location=United States|pages=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged [[science fiction]]al character.&lt;ref name="The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004"/&gt; At the same time, research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the [[supersoldier]]s of the United States and its allies.&lt;ref name="Moreno 2006"/&gt; There has already been a brain research program to "extend the ability to manage information", while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep.&lt;ref name="Managing Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno Innovations: Converging Technologies in Society"/&gt;

Neuroscientist [[Anders Sandberg]] has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra-thin sections of the brain. This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain. As of now, this method is currently being used on mice. This is the first step towards uploading contents of the human brain, including memories and emotions, onto a computer.&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2009"/&gt;

== Arts and culture ==
{{Main|Transhumanism in fiction}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Transhumanist themes have become increasingly prominent in various literary forms during the period in which the movement itself has emerged. Contemporary [[science fiction]] often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life set in [[utopia]]n (especially [[techno-utopia]]n) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many [[horror fiction|horrific]] or [[dystopia]]n tales of human [[bioengineering]] gone wrong. In the decades immediately before transhumanism emerged as an explicit movement, many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] ([[Lazarus Long]] series, 1941–87), [[A. E. van Vogt]] (''[[Slan]]'', 1946), [[Isaac Asimov]] (''[[I, Robot]]'', 1950), [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (''[[Childhood's End]]'', 1953) and [[Stanisław Lem]] (''[[Cyberiad]]'', 1967).&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945) contains an early critique of transhumanism.

In a series of science fiction novels by [[Neal Asher]], the protagonist is an augmented human who carries out missions for "Earth Central Security", an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[superhuman]] coalition. The author portrays a variety of augmentations in addition to the copying of memory and human minds into crystals and the presence of both benevolent and malevolent artificial intelligences.

The [[cyberpunk]] genre, exemplified by [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s ''[[Schismatrix]]'' (1985), has particularly been concerned with the modification of human bodies. Other novels dealing with transhumanist themes that have stimulated broad discussion of these issues include ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'' (1985), by [[Greg Bear]]; ''[[Lilith's Brood|The Xenogenesis Trilogy]]'' (1987–1989), by [[Octavia Butler]]; ''[[Beggars in Spain|The Beggar's Trilogy]]'' (1990–94), by [[Nancy Kress]]; much of [[Greg Egan]]'s work since the early 1990s such as ''[[Permutation City]]'' (1994) and ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'' (1997); The [[Culture series]] of Iain M. Banks; ''The Bohr Maker'' (1995), by [[Linda Nagata]]; ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' (2002), by Richard K. Morgan; ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' (2003), by [[Margaret Atwood]]; ''[[The Elementary Particles]]'' (Eng. trans. 2001) and ''[[The Possibility of an Island]]'' (Eng. trans. 2006), by [[Michel Houellebecq]]; ''Mindscan'' (2005), by [[Robert J. Sawyer]]; the ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' (2002–10), by [[Peter F. Hamilton]]; and ''[[Glasshouse (novel)|Glasshouse]]'' (2005), by [[Charles Stross]]. Some of these works are considered part of the cyberpunk genre or its [[postcyberpunk]] offshoot.

[[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' focuses on the theme of transhumanism. In an interview with ''Today'', Dan Brown said "Transhumanism is the ethics and science of using things like biological and genetic engineering to transform our bodies and make us a more powerful species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/dan-brown-inferno-i-just-spent-3-years-hell-1C9909476|title=Dan Brown on 'Inferno': 'I just spent 3 years in hell'|work=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional transhumanist scenarios have also become popular in other media during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Such treatments are found in [[comic book]]s (''[[Captain America]]'', 1941; ''[[Iron Man]]'' 1963; ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'', 1997; ''[[The Surrogates]]'', 2006), [[film]]s (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', 1968; ''[[Blade Runner]]'', 1982; ''[[Gattaca]]'', 1997, ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', 2015), [[television series]] (the [[Cybermen]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 1966; the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', 1989, ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', 2003, ''[[Black Mirror]]'', 2011), [[manga]] and [[anime]] (''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', 1978; ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'', 1985; ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', 1989; ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', 1995; and the ''[[Gundam]]'' metaseries, 1979), [[video game]]s (''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', 1998; ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'', 1999; ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', 2000; ''[[EVE Online]]'', 2003; ''[[BioShock]]'', 2007; ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', 2004; ''[[Crysis]]'', 2007; ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]''; 2011;&lt;ref name="montrealmirror"/&gt; ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'', 2016) and [[role-playing game]]s.

Carnal Art, a form of [[sculpture]] originated by French artist [[Orlan]], uses the body as its medium and [[plastic surgery]] as its method.&lt;ref name="O'Bryan 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = O'Bryan, C. Jill| title = Carnal Art:Orlan's Refacing| publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]]| year = 2005| isbn = 0-8166-4322-9| oclc = 56755659}}&lt;/ref&gt; French biological anthropologist Dr. Judith Nicogossian also works on representations of the hybrid body.

== Debate{{anchor|Controversy}} ==
The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy.&lt;ref name="Garreau 2006"/&gt; Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself (ethical criticisms). Critics and opponents often see transhumanists' goals as posing threats to [[humanism|human values]].

Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films. These works of art, despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses, are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the [[dystopia]] depicted in the 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]], ''by [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UVRim2WvW50C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Various+arguments+have+been+made+to+the+effect+that+a+society+that+adopts+human+enhancement+technologies+may+come+to+resemble+the+dystopia+depicted+in+the+1932+novel+Brave+New+World,+by+Aldous+Huxley&amp;ots=g4onz4Zzf7&amp;sig=mgG6-iJrLCD-5YnRaI_Dc2JsKj0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|date=2003-05-01|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=9780374706180|location=|pages=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another front, some authors consider that humanity would already be transhuman, because medical advances in recent centuries have significantly altered our species. However, it would not be in a conscious and therefore transhumanistic way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casas|first1=Miquel|title=El fin del Homo sapiens: La naturaleza y el transhumanismo|date=2017|page= 112| publisher=2017|location=Madrid|isbn=9788416996353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feasibility ===
In a 1992 book, sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate. He also objected to what he saw as [[scientism]], fanaticism and [[nihilism]] by a few in advancing transhumanist causes. Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between [[Millenarianism|Millenarian]] religions and [[Historical materialism|Communist doctrines]].&lt;ref name="Dublin 1992"/&gt;

Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism, public health professor [[Gregory Stock]] is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the [[cyborgization]] of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil, [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Kevin Warwick]]. He said that, throughout the 21st century, many humans would find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines, but would remain biological. Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from [[cyberware]], but from the direct manipulation of their [[genetics]], [[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Stock 2002"/&gt;

In her 1992 book ''Science as Salvation'', philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] traces the notion of achieving immortality by [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] of the material human body (echoed in the transhumanist tenet of [[mind uploading]]) to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early 20th century, including [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and members of his circle. She characterizes these ideas as "quasi-scientific dreams and prophesies" involving [[Escapism|visions of escape]] from the body coupled with "self-indulgent, uncontrolled power-fantasies". Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the [[pseudoscientific]] speculations and irrational, fear-of-death-driven fantasies of these thinkers, their disregard for [[layman|laymen]] and the remoteness of their [[eschatological]] visions.&lt;ref name="Midgley 1992"/&gt;

Another critique is aimed mainly at "[[algeny]]" (a portmanteau of ''alchemy'' and ''genetics''), which [[Jeremy Rifkin]] defined as "the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of 'perfecting' their performance".&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1983"/&gt; It emphasizes the issue of [[biocomplexity]] and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological [[evolution]]. This argument, elaborated in particular by the biologist [[Stuart Newman]], is based on the recognition that [[somatic cell nuclear transfer|cloning]] and [[germline]] [[genetic engineering]] of animals are error-prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic [[morphogenesis|development]]. Accordingly, so it is argued, it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos. Performing experiments, particularly ones with permanent biological consequences, on developing humans would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects (see the 1964 [[Declaration of Helsinki]]). Moreover, because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation, it is claimed that there is no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages.&lt;ref name="Newman 2003"/&gt;

As a practical matter, however, international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology. According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky, existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their child's genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Smolensky 2006"/&gt;

Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand, insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans. However, [[bioethicist]] [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of [[computer model]]s of the [[human genome]], the proteins it specifies and the [[tissue engineering]] he argues that it also codes for. With the exponential progress in [[bioinformatics]], Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; [[Public health]] professor [[Gregory Stock]] points to [[Human artificial chromosome|artificial chromosomes]] as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques.&lt;ref name = "Stock 2002"/&gt;

Thinkers{{who|date=October 2014}} who defend the likelihood of [[accelerating change]] point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity's technological capacities. Kurzweil developed this position in his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

=== Intrinsic immorality ===
It has been argued that, in transhumanist thought, humans attempt to substitute themselves for [[God]]. The 2002 [[Holy See|Vatican]] statement ''Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God,''&lt;ref name="International Theological Commission 2002"/&gt; stated that "changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an [[infrahuman]] being is radically immoral", implying, that "man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature". The statement also argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is "unthinkable", since true improvement can come only through religious experience and "[[Divinization (Christian)|realizing more fully the image of God]]". Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises, such as indefinite [[life extension]] or the abolition of suffering. In this view, transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of [[utopian]] movements which seek to [[immanentize the eschaton|create "heaven on earth"]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell &amp; Kilner 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barratt 2006"/&gt; On the other hand, religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals such as the theologians Ronald Cole-Turner and [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] hold that the doctrine of "co-creation" provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology.&lt;ref name="Cole-Turner 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters 1997"/&gt;

Other critics target what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body in the writings of Marvin Minsky, [[Hans Moravec]] and some other transhumanists.&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"/&gt; Reflecting a strain of [[feminism|feminist]] criticism of the transhumanist program, philosopher [[Susan Bordo]] points to "contemporary [[Body image|obsessions with slenderness, youth and physical perfection]]", which she sees as affecting both men and women, but in distinct ways, as "the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture."&lt;ref name="Bordo 1993"/&gt; Some critics question other social implications of the movement's focus on [[body modification]]. Political scientist Klaus-Gerd Giesen, in particular, has asserted that transhumanism's concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of [[atomized individualism]] and body [[commodification]] within a [[consumer culture]].&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"/&gt;

Nick Bostrom responds that the desire to [[rejuvenation (aging)|regain youth]], specifically, and transcend the natural limitations of the human body, in general, is pan-cultural and pan-historical, and is therefore not uniquely tied to the culture of the 20th century. He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the [[Human Genome Project]] and achieve humanity's oldest hope, rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

=== Loss of human identity ===
[[File:Amish vs modern transportation.jpg|thumb|In the U.S., the [[Amish]] are a religious group probably most known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies. Transhumanists draw a parallel by arguing that in the near-future there will probably be "humanish", people who choose to "stay human" by not adopting human enhancement technologies. They believe their choice must be respected and protected.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2000"/&gt;]]

In his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists, including [[germinal choice technology]], [[nanomedicine]] and [[life extension]] strategies. He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"/&gt;

[[Biopolitical]] activist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and biologist [[Stuart Newman]] accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in [[organism]]al identity. They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and [[Cultural artifact|artifact]].&lt;ref name="Newman 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otchet 1998"/&gt; Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in [[modernization]] in which technology has been used to transform the "natural" into the "artefactual".&lt;ref name="Lee 1999"/&gt; In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of "[[monster]]s" such as [[human clone]]s, [[human-animal hybrid|human-animal]] [[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]], or [[bioroid]]s, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from [[social structure|social]] and [[ecosystem|ecological]] systems are seen as problematic. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and the novels ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys From Brazil]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896) depict elements of such scenarios, but Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create [[objectification|objectified]] and [[anomie|socially unmoored]] people as well as [[untermensch|subhumans]]. Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]] possibilities from ever happening, usually in the form of an international [[ban (law)|ban]] on human genetic engineering.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"/&gt;

[[Science journalist]] [[Ronald Bailey]] claims that McKibben's historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2003"/&gt; For example, few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies, but, though they shun television and use horses and buggies, some are welcoming the possibilities of [[gene therapy]] since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="Stock 2002"/&gt; Bailey and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology also reject the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with [[enhancement technologies]] as extremely subjective.

Writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in [[alarmism]] when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human-like intelligence and brains resembling those of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human [[health care]] benefits.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2001"/&gt;

A different response comes from transhumanist [[personhood theory|personhood theorists]] who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research, which science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] termed the "[[Frankenstein complex]]". For example, [[Woody Evans]] argues that, provided they are [[self-aware]], human clones, human-animal chimeras and [[biological uplift|uplifted animals]] would all be unique persons deserving of respect, dignity, rights, responsibilities, and [[citizenship]].&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"/&gt; They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so-called monsters, but what they characterize as the "[[wisdom of repugnance|yuck factor]]" and "[[Human exceptionalism|human-racism]]", that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn 2003"/&gt;

At least one [[public interest]] organization, the U.S.-based [[Center for Genetics and Society]], was formed, in 2001, with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology, such as full-term [[human cloning]] and [[germinal choice technology]]. The [[Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future]] of the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting.

=== Socioeconomic effects{{anchor|Genetic divide}} ===
Some critics of [[libertarian transhumanism]] have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which [[economic inequality|divisions between rich and poor]] are on the rise. [[Bill McKibben]], for example, suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a "genetic divide".&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"/&gt; Even [[Lee M. Silver]], the biologist and [[science writer]] who coined the term "[[reprogenetics]]" and supports its applications, has expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically engineered "haves" and "have nots" if [[social safety net|social democratic reforms]] lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies.&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"/&gt; The 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'' depicts a [[dystopia]]n society in which one's [[social class]] depends entirely on genetic modifications and is often cited by critics in support of these views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

These criticisms are also voiced by [[criticism of libertarianism|non-libertarian]] transhumanist advocates, especially self-described [[democratic transhumanist]]s, who believe that the majority of current or future [[social issues|social]] and [[environmental issues]] (such as [[unemployment]] and [[resource depletion]]) need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a [[guaranteed minimum income]] and [[alternative technology]]). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book ''[[Citizen Cyborg|Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future]]'', argues that [[progressivism|progressives]] or, more precisely, [[techno-progressive]]s must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a [[universal health care]] [[voucher]] system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local [[black market]] or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Sometimes, as in the writings of [[Leon Kass]], the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Kass 2001"/&gt; In his 2002 book ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]'' and in a 2004 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine article, political economist and philosopher [[Francis Fukuyama]] designates transhumanism as the [[world's most dangerous idea]] because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of [[democracy]] (in general) and [[liberal democracy]] (in particular) through a fundamental alteration of "[[human nature]]".&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2004"/&gt; Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] makes a similar argument in his 2003 book ''The Future of Human Nature'', in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another's unilaterally imposed specifications. Habermas thus suggests that the human "species ethic" would be undermined by embryo-stage genetic alteration.&lt;ref name="Habermas 2004"/&gt; Critics such as Kass, Fukuyama and a variety of authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral, but also threaten the [[social order]]. Alternatively, they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the "naturalizing" of [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] or place new means of [[social control|control]] in the hands of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes. [[AI]] pioneer [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] criticizes what he sees as [[misanthropic]] tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues, in particular Marvin Minsky and [[Hans Moravec]], which, by devaluing the human organism per se, promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies.&lt;ref name="Platt 1995"/&gt;

In a 2004 article in the libertarian monthly ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],'' science journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] contested the assertions of Fukuyama by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology. He asserts that [[liberalism]] was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings, or ''de facto'' equality, but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law, or ''de jure'' equality. Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality, giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few. Moreover, he argues, "the crowning achievement of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is the principle of [[Toleration|tolerance]]". In fact, he says, political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and [[posthuman]] rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all, no matter how rich or poor, powerful or powerless, educated or ignorant, enhanced or unenhanced.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004"/&gt; Other thinkers who are sympathetic to transhumanist ideas, such as philosopher [[Russell Blackford]], have also objected to the appeal to [[traditional values|tradition]] and what they see as [[alarmism]] involved in ''Brave New World''-type arguments.&lt;ref name="Blackford 2003"/&gt;

=== Specter of coercive eugenicism ===
Some critics of transhumanism see the old [[eugenics]], [[social Darwinist]], and [[master race]] ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage. Some fear future "[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the killing of the institutionalized and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"/&gt; Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas 2002"/&gt;

The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the [[coercion]] involved in such policies and reject the [[scientific racism|racist]] and [[classist]] assumptions on which they were based, along with the [[pseudoscientific]] notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding.&lt;ref name="Bashford545"&gt;{{cite book | title= The Oxford Handbook of The History of Eugenics | author= [[Bashford, A.]] and [[Levine, P.]] | page= 545| publisher = Oxford University Press | year= 2010 | isbn= 9780195373141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most transhumanist thinkers advocate a "new eugenics", a form of [[egalitarian]] [[liberal eugenics]].&lt;ref name="WTA FAQ 3.2"/&gt; In their 2000 book ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', non-transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 2000"/&gt; Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term "eugenics" (preferring "[[germinal choice]]" or "[[reprogenetics]]")&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"/&gt; to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.

=== Existential risks ===
{{see also|Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence}}
In his 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', British [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Martin Rees]] argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness.&lt;ref name="Rees 2003"/&gt; Advocates of the [[precautionary principle]], such as many in the [[environmental movement]], also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life.&lt;ref name="Arnall 2003"/&gt;

Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of [[existential risk]]. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often [[technorealism|unrealistic]] and sometimes even counter-productive as opposed to the [[technogaian]] current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'', [[science historian]] [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] dissects several views on [[technological change]], including precautionism and the restriction of [[inquiry|open inquiry]]. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the ''[[status quo]]'' of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]], rather than fostering what it considers to be [[anti-science|anti-scientific views]] and [[technophobia]].

[[Nick Bostrom]] argues that even barring the occurrence of a singular [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophic event]], basic [[Malthusian]] and evolutionary forces facilitated by technological progress threaten to eliminate the positive aspects of human society.&lt;ref name="bostrom-evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=The Future of Human Evolution|journal=Bedeutung|volume=284|issue=3|pages=8|date=2009|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html|bibcode=2001SciAm.284c...8R|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0301-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One transhumanist solution proposed by Bostrom to counter existential risks is control of [[differential technological development]], a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed. In this approach, planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"/&gt;

===Authenticity of transhuman goals===
Lara Prendergast has stated that goals of transhumanism, such as trying to cut out food and sex, are inauthentic, because doing so would remove two of the great joys of life.

[[File:Students in theTeaching laboratory, Medical School, Yakusu Wellcome L0039121.jpg|thumb|''Évolués'' in the [[Belgian Congo]] studying [[medicine]].]]
'''''Évolué''''' ({{IPA-fr|evɔlɥe|lang}}, {{lit.}} "evolved" or "developed") is a [[French language|French]] label used during the [[colonialism|colonial era]] to refer to a native [[Africa|African]] or [[Asia|Asian]] who had "evolved" by becoming [[Europeanisation|Europeanised]] through [[education]] or [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and had accepted European values and patterns of behavior. It is most commonly used to refer to individuals within the [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] and [[French colonial empire]]s. ''Évolués'' spoke [[French language|French]], followed European (rather than [[Custom (law)|customary]]) laws, usually held [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs (although rarely higher than clerks), and lived primarily in [[urban area]]s of the colony.

==Belgian colonies==

The term was also used to describe the growing native middle class in the [[Belgian Congo]] (the modern-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) between the latter part of [[World War II]] and the independence of the colony in 1960. Most ''évolué''s emerged from the Congolese who filled skilled positions (such as clerks and nurses) made available by the economic boom in the country following the war.&lt;ref name= gibbs70&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1991|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial administrators defined an ''évolué'' as "a man having broken social ties with his group, [and] having entered another system of motivations, another system of values."{{sfn|Gillet|Cornet|2010|p=19}} While there were no universal criteria for determining ''évolué'' status, it was generally accepted that one would have "a good knowledge of French, adhere to Christianity, and have some form of post-primary education."&lt;ref name= gibbs70/&gt; Early on in their history, most ''évolué''s sought to use their unique status to earn special privileges in the Congo.&lt;ref name= willame24&gt;{{harvnb|Willame|1972|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked that the colonial administration recognize their role as mediators between the Belgians and the native "savages."&lt;ref name= willame25&gt;{{harvnb|Willame|1972|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Belgian Congo native club.jpg|thumb|A social club in the Belgian Congo, c. 1943.]]
Since opportunities for upward mobility through the colonial structure were limited, the ''évolué'' class institutionally manifested itself through clubs and associations. Through these groups they could enjoy trivial privileges that made them feel distinct from the Congolese "masses".&lt;ref name= willame25/&gt; In 1947, there were 110 social clubs consisting of 5,609 members throughout the Congo's cities. From 1952 to 1956, the number of clubs rose from 131 to 317, with their membership increasing from 7,661 to 15,345.&lt;ref name= willame26&gt;{{harvnb|Willame|1972|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these associations were rather small, but some eventually grew in size to encompass entire regions and ethnic groups, such as the ''[[ABAKO|Alliance des Bakongo]]''.&lt;ref name= gibbs71&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1991|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1958, colonial officials estimated that there were 175,000 people who could be classed as ''évolués'' in the colony.{{sfn|Gillet|Cornet|2010|p=19}} In the final years leading up to independence, ''évolués'' played a major role in colonial [[propaganda]] as they were felt to exemplify the success of the Belgian [[civilizing mission]] begun under [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. In particular, it was felt that after independence, the assimilation of European values by the ''évolués'' meant that Belgian civilian inhabitants of the Congo could continue to live in the Congo as part of a culturally European [[multiracial]] state.{{sfn|Gillet|Cornet|2010|p=19}}

In 1954, the colonial government opened [[Lovanium University]] in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]] in order to provide university education to Congolese ''évolués''.

Many of the leaders of the [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] parties in the Belgian Congo were members of the ''évolué'' class. In the 1970s, the Congolese dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] launched a policy known as [[Authenticité (Zaire)|''Authenticité'']] in which he called for Congolese people to renounce all the cultural legacies of the colonial period by dressing and speaking in an "authentic" Congolese manner.

==French colonies==
In the [[French colonial empire]], ''évolués'' were seen as individuals who were the desired end product of France's [[assimilation (French colonial)|assimilation policy]]. ''Évolués'' were treated as an [[élite]] and a privileged group by the colonial administrators.
