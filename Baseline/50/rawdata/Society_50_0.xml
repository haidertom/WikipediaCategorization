'''''$pread''''' was a quarterly [[magazine]] by and for [[sex worker]]s and those who support their rights. The magazine's focus was: "personal experiences and political insights" and it "contain(ed) practical information like news, features, health columns, and resources related to the sex industry".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About |url=http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |publisher=$pread Magazine |accessdate=April 2, 2015|date=May 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528104430/http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |archivedate=May 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Articles were written by readers as well as by figures from academic, cultural, and literary backgrounds, most of whom are current or former sex workers. The magazine was launched on March 15, 2005 by Rachel Aimee, Rebecca Lynn, and Raven Strega.&lt;ref name="Rough Trade"/&gt; ''$pread'' was based in New York City, and was sold throughout the United States and Canada at [[independent bookstore]]s and via national distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/pread-magazine-provided-a-smart-funny-lifeline-for-sex-workers-around-the-world-069|title=Remembering '$pread,' the Magazine That Gave Sex Workers a Voice - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-editor said, "We want the general public to become aware of issues such as the physical working conditions of sex workers and their health care and housing needs, and to start considering sex workers as real people rather than mythical beasts who only come to life when someone drops a quarter into a slot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-01-11/people/whore-pride/2 ''Whore Pride''], Rachel Kramer Bussel, The Village Voice, January 11, 2005 Accessed March 26, 2009.

''$pread'' published personal experiences, political insights, and contained practical information, such as news, features, health columns, and sex industry resources. ''$pread'' supported the sex work community by donating 15% of each print run to the workplaces of and the outreach organizations utilized by sex workers. The tax outreach program "helps sex workers who don't know they can and should file taxes", said [[Audacia Ray]], an executive editor at the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/nyregion/05sex.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Federal%20Taxes%20(US) An Old Profession That's New to Doing Taxes]. Corey Kilgannon, ''The New York Times''. April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 30, 2010, ''$pread'' has ceased printed publication due to both financial issues and not having enough people to keep the operation running, even if "there was $100k made available".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spreadmagazine.org/2010/08/30/pread-is-dead-really/ $pread is Dead, Really] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 |date=April 18, 2009 }}. Retrieved September 6, 2010.  $pread Blog, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Because ''$pread'' was part of the [[sex workers rights]] movement, it was criticized by some branches of feminism that believe that sex work is inherently degrading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among feminists, perceptions are no less polarized – sex workers are either fully empowered agents using their sexuality in unassailably positive ways, or victims of a job that degrades them by its very nature. Most feminist dialogues about sex work sound more like monologues; defensiveness, mischaracterizations, and willful ignorance abound, making casualties of complexity and nuance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 ''Hot &amp; Bothered'', Bitch Magazine, Issue 33, Fall 2006 ] Accessed March 26, 2009.[https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 Archived] April 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''$pread'' Book==
[[The Feminist Press]] released a collection of some of the articles and essays from the original publications of the magazine into a 368-page book on the 15th March 2015 entitled ''$pread : The Best of the Magazine that Illuminated the Sex Industry and Started a Media Revolution''.&lt;ref name="$pread book publication from The Feminist Press"&gt;{{cite web |title=$pread book publication by The Feminist Press |url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XfDSTm1n?url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |archivedate=April 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abstinence-only sex education''' is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage. It often excludes other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.

Evidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b |pmid=17885460 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=446–52 |year=2007 |last1=Ott |first1=Mary A |last2=Santelli |first2=John S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chin2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.006 |pmid=22341164 |title=The Effectiveness of Group-Based Comprehensive Risk-Reduction and Abstinence Education Interventions to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Adolescent Pregnancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Sexually Transmitted Infections |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=272–94 |year=2012 |last1=Chin |first1=Helen B |last2=Sipe |first2=Theresa Ann |last3=Elder |first3=Randy |last4=Mercer |first4=Shawna L |last5=Chattopadhyay |first5=Sajal K |last6=Jacob |first6=Verughese |last7=Wethington |first7=Holly R |last8=Kirby |first8=Doug |last9=Elliston |first9=Donna B |last10=Griffith |first10=Matt |last11=Chuke |first11=Stella O |last12=Briss |first12=Susan C |last13=Ericksen |first13=Irene |last14=Galbraith |first14=Jennifer S |last15=Herbst |first15=Jeffrey H |last16=Johnson |first16=Robert L |last17=Kraft |first17=Joan M |last18=Noar |first18=Seth M |last19=Romero |first19=Lisa M |last20=Santelli |first20=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Un2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2 |title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Underhill |first1=Kristen |last2=Operario |first2=Don |last3=Montgomery |first3=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or [[unplanned pregnancy]] when compared to comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;

The topic of abstinence-only education is controversial in the United States, with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity, and critics arguing that abstinence-only education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aims.

==Description==
Abstinence education teaches children and [[adolescents]] to abstain from sexual activity, and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). With a heavy focus on the importance of "family values," programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/edth.12034 |title=Just the Facts? The Separation of Sex Education from Moral Education |journal=Educational Theory |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=443–60 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17162310&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1931-2393.2006.tb00277.x |pmid=17162310 |title=Changes in Formal Sex Education: 1995?2002 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=182–9 |year=2006 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Santelli |first2=John S |last3=Singh |first3=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
[[Systematic review]]s of research evaluating abstinence-only sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing [[unwanted pregnancy]] or the spread of STIs, among other shortfalls.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirby, D.|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|year=2007|url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}} {{cite web |url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27677440&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17437199.2016.1240625 |pmid=27677440 |title=A comprehensive review of reviews of school-based interventions to improve sexual-health |journal=[[Health Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–52 |year=2016 |last1=Denford |first1=Sarah |last2=Abraham |first2=Charles |last3=Campbell |first3=Rona |last4=Busse |first4=Heide }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has recommended against the use of abstinence-only sex education because it has been found to be ineffective, and because the media frequently conveys information about non-abstinence.&lt;ref name=pmid20805150&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-1544 |pmid=20805150 |title=Sexuality, Contraception, and the Media |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=576–82 |year=2010 |last1=Strasburger |first1=V. C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STI transmission ===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that abstinence-focused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDs.&lt;ref name=pmid26149164&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1570162x13666150511143943 |pmid=26149164 |title=Effective Evidence-Based Programs for Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Infections: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Current HIV Research |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=432–8 |year=2015 |last1=Petrova |first1=Dafina |last2=Garcia-Retamero |first2=Rocio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinence-only education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in high-income countries.&lt;ref name=Un2007/&gt; In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect.&lt;ref name=pmid24594648&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0089692 |pmid=24594648 |pmc=3942389 |title=School Based Sex Education and HIV Prevention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e89692 |year=2014 |last1=Fonner |first1=Virginia A |last2=Armstrong |first2=Kevin S |last3=Kennedy |first3=Caitlin E |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Kevin R |last5=Sweat |first5=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Douglas Kirby]] reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence-only education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.3.18 |title=The impact of abstinence and comprehensive sex and STD/HIV education programs on adolescent sexual behavior |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=18 |year=2008 |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents.&lt;ref name=pmid21199984&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251 |title=Interventions to Reduce Sexual Risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Adolescents |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume=165 |year=2011 |last1=Johnson |first1=Blair T |last2=Scott-Sheldon |first2=Lori A. J |last3=Huedo-Medina |first3=Tania B |last4=Carey |first4=Michael P |pmc=4361805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially life-saving information about sexual risk reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17441692.2012.759609 |pmid=23327516 |pmc=3984004 |title=Abstinence promotion under PEPFAR: The shifting focus of HIV prevention for youth |journal=Global Public Health |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2013 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Speizer |first2=Ilene S |last3=Edelstein |first3=Zoe R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found "that state-level abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates, although we find that state-level policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some states."&lt;ref name=pmid26918400&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hec.3315 |pmid=26918400 |title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes |journal=Health Economics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=403–420 |year=2017 |last1=Carr |first1=Jillian B |last2=Packham |first2=Analisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===
Research conducted on 48 states of United States showed that "The level of abstinence education (no provision, covered, promoted, stressed) was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates.&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; Also, in John S.

==Society and culture==

===Support===
Proponents of abstinence-only sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage, and that [[premarital sex|sex before marriage]] and at a [[Child sexuality|young age]] has heavy physical and emotional costs.&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182953/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html |date=2012-03-10 }} Retrieved on 2007-14-03&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage, and therefore, that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14681811.2012.738604 |title=The use and misuse of pleasure in sex education curricula |journal=Sex Education |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=305–18 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon |last2=Lustig |first2=Kara |last3=Graling |first3=Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage, which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views On Sex - And Sex Education - Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.

Proponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers, which should be discouraged in an era when [[HIV]] and other incurable STIs are widespread and when [[teen pregnancy]] is an ongoing concern. Many supporters of abstinence-only education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities,&lt;ref name=pmid22022362&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658 |pmid=22022362 |pmc=3194801 |title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=e24658 |year=2011 |last1=Stanger-Hall |first1=Kathrin F |last2=Hall |first2=David W }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Contra-Contraception"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shorto |first=Russel |title=Contra-Contraception |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=March 18, 2017 |df= }}{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults.

===Opposition ===
Opponents and critics, which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine, public health, adolescent health, and psychology, argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents. Not only is information inadequate, but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.10.006 |pmid=16387256 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education: A review of U.S. Policies and programs |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2006 |last1=Santelli |first1=John |last2=Ott |first2=Mary A |last3=Lyon |first3=Maureen |last4=Rogers |first4=Jennifer |last5=Summers |first5=Daniel |last6=Schleifer |first6=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate information is especially important since, although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method, it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice it.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256/&gt;

Some critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education.

Abstinence-only education is not supported by the majority of public school teachers, parents, and students. The majority in each of these groups is opposed to abstinence-only curriculum and wants a more comprehensive curriculum. "Although more than nine in 10 teachers believe that students should be taught about contraception... one in four are instructed not to teach the subject." Even when there are no rules limiting sex education to abstinence-only, teachers may continue to teach abstinence-only curriculum because they fear retaliation from the local community. Parents also want their children to be taught about contraception. "Most parents (65%) believe that sex education should encourage young people to delay sexual activity but also prepare them to use birth control and practice safe sex once they do become sexually active." 86% of parents want schools to teach their children how to get STD testing, 77% want their children to learn how to talk to a partner about STDs and birth control, 71% want them to learn how to use condoms, and 68% want them to learn about using other forms of birth control. Students are also opposed to abstinence-only education. "Approximately half of students in grades 7-12 report needing more information about what to do in the event of rape or sexual assault, how to get tested for HIV and other STDs, and how to talk with a partner about birth control and STDs." Clearly, there is a disparity between the type of sex education curriculum teachers, parents, and students want and what government policy determines they receive.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia. "Sex Education: Politicians, Parents, Teachers, and Teens." ''The Reproductive Rights Reader''. Nancy Ehrenreich, Ed. New York City, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
Another problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence. Santelli (2006) states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinence-only sex education, using a mixture of non-specific phrases, like "postponing sex" or "never had [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]]," while also using moralistic terms or phrases like ''[[virgin]]'', ''chaste'', and "making a commitment".&lt;ref name="pmid16387256"/&gt; This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penile-vaginal, including [[mutual masturbation]], [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex, which is termed ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Intimate"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan Strong |author2=Christine DeVault |author3=Theodore F.

PEPFAR was founded in 2003 with the mandate that 33% of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinence-only education.

=== Funding ===
In the U.S., states may apply for federal funding of abstinence-only sex education programs from either Title V, the [[Adolescent Family Life Act]] (AFLA), and/or Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE).&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; To be eligible for funding, programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act, which is reproduced here verbatim:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm Social Security Act, Section 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026183857/http://ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2) For purposes of this section, the term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational program which—
:(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
:(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;
:(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
:(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
:(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
:(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
:(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
:(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Funding, which began in the 1980s, has continued to increase since its inception, though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10282580.2010.517970 |title=Barack Obama vs Bristol Palin: Why the President's sex education policy wins |journal=Contemporary Justice Review |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=411–24 |year=2010 |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana A |last2=Miller |first2=Monica K }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[George W.

===Religion===
Religious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and pre-marital sex, some of which are covered by:

*[[Religion and birth control]]
*[[Christian views on contraception]]
*[[Protestant views on birth control]]
*[[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]]
*[[Sexuality and Mormonism]]
*[[Fornication]]
*[[Fornication#Islam|Premarital sex in Islam]]

The philosophical [[sex-positive movement]] cuts across many religions, and rejects the idea that consensual pre-marital sex or contraception are immoral.

{{Criminal law}}
An '''assault''' is the act of inflicting physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-overview.html|title=Assault and Battery Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=criminal.findlaw.com|publisher=|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]] and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]]. 

Traditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as "assault". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.

Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.

==Related definitions==

===Battery===
In jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See [[common assault]]. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act&lt;ref&gt;An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary (see Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams, ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2012) at p 901. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.&lt;ref&gt;A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.

===Aggravated assault===
[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:
* cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent
* cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a [[motor vehicle]] during [[road rage]]; often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.

==Defenses==
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

===Consent===
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

[[consent (criminal law)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;(RvG ref 6. 1980): see{{cite web|url=http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm |title=R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (''R v Wilson'' [1996] Crim LR 573), or horseplay (''R v Jones'' [1987] Crim LR 123). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish law, consent is not a defense for assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/1975/1975_JC_30.html|title=''Smart v. H. M. Advocate'', [1975&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ScotHC HCJ_1, 1975 SLT 65, 1975 JC 30.|author=|date=|website=bailii.org|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s.&amp;nbsp;58 [[Children Act 2004]] limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s.&amp;nbsp;39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

===Defense of property===
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[Defence of property|defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Regional details==

===Canada===
Assault is an offence under s. 265 of the  Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name=1985-46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |title=CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 |publisher= |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.

The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt; This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.

Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:

* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].

An individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.

===India===
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; sections 351 through 358.
{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - "Indian Penal Code"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault". Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

===Nigeria===
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2029|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2025|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Islands===
'''Marshall Islands'''

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ Criminal Code [31 MIRC Ch 1&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413025838/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

===Republic of Ireland===
Section 2 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

===South Africa===
[[South African law]] does not draw the distinction between assault and battery. ''Assault'' is a [[common law crime]] defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him". The law also recognises the crime of ''assault with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]]'', where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Milton |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law crimes |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Co |year=1996 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-7021-3773-0 |pages=405–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common law crime of ''[[indecent assault]]'' was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]], and replaced by a statutory crime of ''[[sexual assault]]''.

For the meaning of "assault" in this provision, see Logdon v. DPP [1976] Crim LR 121, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|DC]]. This offence was abolished and replaced by the [[Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005]].

It related to officers of the [[Serious Organized Crime Agency]] and was repealed when that agency was abolished.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}

English law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

A [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.

=====Aggravated assaults=====
An assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing "actual bodily harm" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, "[[grievous bodily harm]]" (GBH).
;[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]]: Also referred to as "malicious wounding" or "unlawful wounding". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.
;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as "wounding with intent". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

Other aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:
;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;[[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:
:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or
:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/section/10 section 10(1)] of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].
;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]]. Those sections relate respectively to persons given police powers by a chief police officer, detention contractors retained by police, accredited contractors under a community safety accreditation scheme, and weights and measures inspectors.
;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).
;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).
;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Assaulting an officer of the court: This offence is created by section 14(1)(b) of the [[County Courts Act 1984]].
;Cruelty to persons under sixteen: Section 1(1) of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provides that it is an offence for a person who has attained the age of sixteen years, and who has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, to, amongst other things, wilfully assault that child or young person, or to cause or procure that child or young person to be assaulted, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.
;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''&lt;ref&gt;1987 SCCR 534&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:

{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply "evil intent",&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

====Northern Ireland====
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:
* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;
* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43
* Common assault: under section 47
* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47
The [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:
* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.

That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

=== Australia ===
The term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State. The legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault, where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes, and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4274/assault-laws-in-australia-definitions-and-defences.aspx|title=Assault Laws in Australia: Definitions and Defences|website=www.findlaw.com.au|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the Crimes Act 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties. These include:

====Assault with further specific intent====
* Acts done to the person with intent to murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wounding or grievous bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use or possession of a weapon to resist arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault causing certain injuries====
* Actual bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the term is not defined in the ''Crimes Act'', but case law indicates actual bodily harm may include injuries such as bruises and scratches,&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|305|2009|litigants=R v McIntyre |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as psychological injuries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|442|2005|litigants=Li v R |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; if the injury inflicted is more than merely transient (the injury does not necessarily need to be permanent)&lt;ref&gt;''R v Donovan'' [1934] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 498; [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/cases/NZPoliceLawRp/1934/8.pdf (1934) 5 New Zealand Police Law Reports 247].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|Felony Sentences in State Courts, study by the United States Department of Justice.]]

In the United States,{{where|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- federal? some states? all states and territories? including Louisiana which did not incorporate English common law? --&gt; assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]]. However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]] (unless the victim is a [[Police|law enforcement]] officer){{fact|date=September 2018}}, or in New York State for example if the offender is a repeat offender. As a misdemeanor, however, it can still result in incarceration and in a criminal record. The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at [[common law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002201839505900307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The apparent, present ability to carry out;
# An unlawful attempt;
# To commit a violent injury; 
# Upon another.

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Laws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:
* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another 
* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&amp;Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as demonstrated below.

In [[Kansas]] the law on assault states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |title=KS Statutes: Ch 21 Article 34: Crimes Against Persons |date=2007-11-14 |access-date=2016-09-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114225316/http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Assault is intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.}}

In [[New York State]], assault (as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/120.05|title=Article 120 - NY Penal Law - Assault Menacing Stalking - Law|publisher=New York State Senate|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires an actual injury. Other states define this as battery; there is no crime of battery in New York. However, in New York if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact, that is called "menacing". A person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree (a [[misdemeanor|Class A misdemeanor]]; punishable with up to one year [[incarceration]], [[probation]] for an extended time, and a permanent [[criminal record]]) when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person, and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree (a [[Class E felony]]) if they have a previous conviction for the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-240-30.html|title=New York Consolidated Laws, Penal Law - PEN § 240.30 - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-harassment-laws.html|title=New York Harassment Laws - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/opinion/when-is-a-threat-a-criminal-act.html|title=Opinion - When Is a Threat a Criminal Act?|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/second-degree-aggravated-harassment.html|title=Second Degree Aggravated Harassment|author=|date=|website=The Law Office of Crotty &amp; Saland|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York also has specific laws against [[hazing]], when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.

[[North Dakota]] law states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1c17.pdf?20130902151232|title=North Dakota Century Code t12.1c17|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tennessee]] assault is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/|title=LexisNexis® Custom Solution: Tennessee Code Research Tool|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double [[inchoate offense]].

In some states, [[consent (criminal law)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
* A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
* A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

===Ancient Greece===
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]]. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1976) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[Atë]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

'''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''''' (titled '''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive''''' for the British edition) is a 2005 book by academic and popular science author [[Jared Diamond]], in which Diamond first defines ''collapse'':  "a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time."  He then reviews the causes of historical and pre-historical instances of [[societal collapse]] — particularly those involving significant influences from [[environmental change]]s, the effects of [[climate change]], hostile neighbors, [[international trade|trade partners,]] and the society's response to the foregoing four challenges— and considers the success or failure different societies have had in coping with such threats.

While the bulk of the book is concerned with the demise of these historical civilizations, Diamond also argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Easter-island-moai.jpg|thumb|Diamond says [[Easter Island]] provides the best historical example of a societal collapse in isolation.]]

In the prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes his [[methodology]] in one paragraph:
{{quote|text=This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which [[environmental problems]] contribute. My previous book (''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Collapses of past societies ===

Diamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbours, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society's response to the forgoing four factors.

The root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.

Diamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the [[Greenlandic Norse people|Greenland Norse]] to eat fish. Diamond also states that "it would be absurd to claim that [[environmental damage]] must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] is a modern counter-example, and the [[destruction of Carthage]] by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern societies ===
{{See also|Planetary boundaries}}

He also lists twelve [[List of environmental issues|environmental problems]] facing humankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies:
# [[Deforestation]] and [[habitat destruction]]
# [[Soil]] problems ([[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[soil fertility]] losses)
# [[Water management]] problems
# [[Overhunting]]
# [[Overfishing]]
# Effects of [[introduced species]] on [[native species]]
# [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]
# Increased per-capita impact of people

Further, he says four new factors may contribute to the weakening and collapse of present and future societies:

&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[Anthropogenic climate change]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Buildup of [[toxin]]s in the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[energy crisis|Energy shortages]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Full human use of the Earth’s [[photosynthetic]] capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
In the last chapter, he discusses environmental problems facing modern societies and addresses objections that are often given to dismiss the importance of environmental problems (section "One-liner objections"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", pages 503-514 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). In the "Further readings" section, he gives suggestions to people who ask "What can I do as an individual?".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, "Further readings" section of the chapter 16, pages 569-574 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws conclusions, such as:
{{Block quote|In fact, one of the main lesson to be learned from the collapses of the Maya, Anasazi, Easter Islanders, and those other past societies [...] is that a society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. [...] The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, [[resource consumption]], and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", page 509 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, he answers the question, "What are the choices that we must make if we are to succeed, and not to fail?" by identifying two crucial choices distinguishing the past societies that failed from those that survived:&lt;ref name=Choices&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?", section "Reasons for hope", pages 522-524 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-term planning: "[...] the courage to practice long-term thinking, and to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions."&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;
* Willingness to reconsider core values: "[...] the courage to make painful decisions about values. Which of the values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained under new changed circumstances? Which of these treasured values must instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?"&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;

''Collapse'' is divided into four parts.
*Part One describes the environment of the US state of [[Montana]], focusing on the lives of several individuals to put a human face on the interplay between society and the environment.
*Part Two describes past societies that have collapsed. Diamond uses a "framework" when considering the collapse of a society, consisting of five "sets of factors" that may affect what happens to a society: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of [[trade|trading partners]], and the society's  responses to its environmental problems. A recurrent problem in collapsing societies is a structure that creates "a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole." 

The societies Diamond describes are:

* The [[Greenland]] [[Norsemen|Norse]] (cf. [[Hvalsey Church]]) (climate change, environmental damage, loss of trading partners,  hostile neighbors, irrational reluctance to eat fish, chiefs looking after their short-term interests).  
* [[Easter Island]] (a society that [[History_of_Easter_Island#Destruction_of_society_and_population|collapsed]] entirely due to environmental damage)
* The [[Polynesia]]ns of [[Pitcairn Island]] (environmental damage and loss of trading partners)
* The [[Anasazi]] of southwestern North America (environmental damage and climate change)
* The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of Central America (environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors)
* Finally, Diamond discusses three past success stories:
** The tiny egalitarian Pacific island of [[Tikopia]]
** The agricultural success of egalitarian central [[New Guinea]]
** The [[forest management]] in stratified [[Japan#Ecoregions|Japan]] of the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]]-era, and in [[Germany]].

*Part Three examines modern societies, including:
** The [[Rwandan genocide|collapse into genocide of Rwanda]], caused in part by overpopulation
** The failure of [[Haiti]] compared with the relative success of its neighbor on [[Hispaniola]], the [[Dominican Republic]]
** The problems facing a [[developing country|developing nation]], [[China]]
** The problems facing a [[First World]] nation, [[Australia]]
*Part Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and [[globalization]], and "extracts practical lessons for us today" (pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23). Specific attention is given to the [[polder model]] as a way [[Dutch people|Dutch]] society has addressed its challenges and the "top-down" and most importantly "bottom-up" approaches that we must take now that "our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course" (p.&amp;nbsp;498) in order to avoid the "12 problems of [[Sustainability|non-sustainability]]" that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees "signs of hope" nevertheless and arrives at a position of "cautious optimism" for all our futures.

==Reviews==
[[Tim Flannery]] gave ''Collapse'' the highest praise in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', writing:&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Flannery]], [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5706/45.full "Learning from the past to change our future"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', volume 307, 7 January 2005, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=While he planned the book, Diamond at first thought that it would deal only with human impacts on the environment. Instead, what has emerged is arguably the most incisive study of senescing human civilizations ever written. [...] the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that ''Collapse'' must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.}}

''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the [[future]]. Secondly, the reviewer claimed ''Collapse'' contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond purportedly overstated the number of [[Starvation|starving]] people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3555894 "History on an environmental scale. Of porpoises and plantations. When communities self-destruct"], ''[[The Economist]]'', volume 374, 13 January 2005, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of British Columbia]] professor of [[ecological planning]] [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] wrote that ''Collapse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile, able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreover, Rees wrote that ''Collapse'' is "a necessary antidote" to followers of [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]], such as [[Bjørn Lomborg]] who authored ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. Rees explained this assertion as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]], [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7021/full/433015a.html "Contemplating the abyss"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', volume 433'', 6 January 2005, pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Human behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, ''Collapse'', confronts this contradiction head-on.}}

[[Jennifer Marohasy]] of the [[think-tank]] [[Institute of Public Affairs]] wrote a critical review in ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'', in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Marohasy]], [http://www.ipa.org.au/library/EE%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf "Australia's Environment: Undergoing Renewal, Not Collapse"] (PDF), ''Energy and Environment'' 16 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Malcolm Gladwell]] highlights the way Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/03/050103crbo_books?currentPage=1 "The Vanishing"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 2005-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Diamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.}}

While Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.

In 2006 the book was shortlisted for [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books]] award, eventually losing out to [[David Bodanis]]' ''Electric Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Royal Society]], [http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 "Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists"] ''[[The Royal Society]]'', 2008-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Jared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage and cultural inflexibility is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists, who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and [[slave raiding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Benny Peiser|author-link=Benny Peiser|year=2005|title=From Genocide to Ecocide: The Rape of Rapa Nui|journal= [[Energy &amp; Environment]] |volume= 16 No. 3&amp;4|url=http://archive.4edu.info/Youth_2007/ESY_06.5_From_Genocide_to_Ecocide.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline, and that introduced animals—first rats and then sheep—were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora, which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930–1960.&lt;ref&gt;Terry L. Hunt and Carl P. Lipo, [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5767/1603.full "Late Colonization of Easter Island"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Questioning Collapse'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by anthropologists criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books ''Collapse'' and ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1145682|title = Review: Questioning Collapse|last = Flexner|first = James L.|date = December 2011|journal = Pacific Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|volume = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2010, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] released the documentary film ''Collapse'' based on Diamond's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715324/ ''Collapse: Based on the Book by Jared Diamond'', [[Internet Movie Database]] (page visited on 10 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26059223&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Columbia Water Center''' ('''CWC''') was established in January 2008 as a branch of the [[Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]]. The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including [[water scarcity]], access, quality and climate risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/articles/view/2125 |title=The Earth Institute Water |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's stated mission is to "creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization," by combining "the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/about-us/|title=Columbia Water Center: About Us |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing [[hydrologists]], [[climatologists]], [[environmental engineer]]s, and [[water policy]] analysts. The Director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2757  |title=The Earth Institute Profiles: Upmanu Lall |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Gentine, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2328/Website/Pierre_Gentines_Homepage/Lab.html|title=Gentine Lab website|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/05/11/earth-water-and-sky-a-conversation-with-pierre-gentine-a-new-columbia-water-center-scientist/|title=Earth, Water and Sky –A Conversation with Pierre Gentine, a new Columbia Water Center Scientist|date=11 May 2011|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|publisher=State of the planet|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus.&lt;ref name="research themes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/  |title=The Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Earth Institute, under the leadership of [[Jeff Sachs]], is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2021|title=PepsiCo Foundation announces major new grant to the Earth Institute at Columbia University to promote global water sustainability |publisher=[[Earth Institute]]|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[PepsiCo]] Foundation awarded the [[Earth Institute]] $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall.  This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|title=Our planet sustainability efforts and goals|publisher=PepsiCo|accessdate=5 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001095523/http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, CWC has partnered with the [[Federal University of Ceará]] in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors.  In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents.

As part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area.&lt;ref name="CWC Article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/June/20100528161751kjleinad0.6077082.html |title=Columbia Water Center at Work Across Globe |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better [[irrigation]] technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains.  A key objective is to reduce the [[overdrafting|groundwater stress]] in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Circleofblue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/qa-upmanu-lall-gives-insight-to-indias-nexus-of-energy-food-and-water?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=Circle of Blue Water News|author=J. Carl Ganter |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the CWC has partnered with [[Punjab Agricultural University]] to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive [[Tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometers]] to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/May/20100528153333kjleinad0.4795191.html?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers.&lt;ref name="tensiometer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/11/17/%E2%80%9Csmall-is-also-beautiful%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-appropriate-technology-cuts-rice-famers%E2%80%99-water-use-by-30-percent-in-punjab-india/?CP.rss=true |title=‘Small is Also Beautiful’ – Appropriate Technology Cuts Rice Famers’ Water Use by 30 Percent in Punjab, India |publisher=blogs.ei.columbia.edu |author=Lakis Polycarpou |date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform [[subsidies in India|electricity subsidies]] to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers.&lt;ref name="WaterWideWeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |title=Incentives for Water Conservation in Gujarat |publisher=WaterWideWeb.org |author=Eryn-Ashlei Bailey |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502164844/http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |archivedate=2011-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work in Mali coincides with the [[Millennium Villages Project]]. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available.  Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, [[market forces]] and [[public-private partnership]]s.

==Current Research ==

In recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ America's Water]===

The America’s Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems.&lt;ref name="America's Water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=America's water |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piscesfoundation.org/partnering-with-academia-to-address-u-s-water-challenges/|title=Partnering with Academia to Address U.S. Water Challenges|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2017|last=Stoner|first=Nancy|publisher=Pisces Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/03/19/waking-up-to-americas-water-challenges/|title=Waking up to America’s Water Challenges|date=19 March 2015|publisher=State of the Planet|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ The Global Floods Initiative]===

The Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving  climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods.&lt;ref name="Global Floods Initiative 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Global floods initiative |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky" /&gt;

The initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El-Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions]===

The Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers.&lt;ref name="Data Analytics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Data analytics and multi-scale predictions |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/5115-2/|title=Predictions, Surface Energy, Plants: Understanding the Hydrologic Cycle|publisher=Columbia Water Center|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools.&lt;ref name="Risk and Financial Instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Risk and finantial instruments |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Water Center  studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to  promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and [[groundwater pollution]] and saving energy from groundwater pumping.&lt;ref name="Water, Food, Energy Nexus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Water, food, energy nexus |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Circleofblue" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Communication ethics''' is the notion that  an individual's or group's behavior are governed by their morals which in turn affects [[communication]].  Generally speaking communication ethics deals with the [[moral good]] present in any form of human communication.  This includes interpersonal communication, [[mass media]]ted communication, and [[digital communication]].

==Overview==
Communication ethics concerns not only the individual, but is of great concern to businesses, corporations, and professional entities.  A business with unethical communication practices is not as effective as one with ethical communication practices. For example, a business with unethical communication practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Who Suppress Free Speech|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/06/filming-the-watchmen-why-the-first-amendment-protects-your-right-to-film-the-police-in-public-places}}&lt;/ref&gt; may withhold evidence that it is harming the environment or breaking a law through a lack of transparence; while a business with ethical communication practices will immediately press a release to the affected parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgeon General on Tobacco|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/initiatives/tobacco/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fearless, Adversarial Journalism|url=http://www.firstlook.org/theintercept/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, transparency makes the business more effective because it notifies its clients, prospective or established, providers/suppliers, or other affiliates of the potential [[environmental hazard]] or law violation. In other words, in this example, transparency will encourage trust and good faith, that the effective business will not conceal what is in the interest of its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Locking In Public Access to Scientific Knowledge by Unlocking Scholarly Research|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/locking-public-access-scientific-knowledge-unlocking-scholarly-research}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of counterexample, there may be a time when censorship is the more effective business practice: take the case of trade secrets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment to Economic Espionage Act|url=https://www.chillingeffects.org/blog_entries/742}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a design method or management tactic is not openly revealed in the name of competitive advantage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Software Foundation Privacy Policy|url=http://www.fsf.org/about/free-software-foundation-privacy-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when terms of agreement/use that a business may have with a service provider forbids transparency. In the latter counterexample, a business may use social media to advertise, but the social media service provider may limit the conduct of its users. Here, if the business considers social media to be a valuable service to achieve its advertising, it may have to censor its product or service to preserve its agreement with the social media provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Terms of Agreement|url=http://www.facebook.com/terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication ethics is also a division &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NCA|title=Communication Ethics Division|url=http://commethics.org/news/}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NCA (National Communication Association) which was established by Western Michigan University in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA Communication Ethics Commission - Newsletter|url=http://wmich.edu/ethics/docs/85_newsletter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the NCA has adopted a Credo for Ethical Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCA Credo|url=http://www.dinfosalum.org/credo2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Communication Ethics Conference has been held every year for the last 13 years, and has various speakers from Communication Studies backgrounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7446">'''Communication for Development''' ('''C4D''') is all the different types of communication that need to take place in societies if sustainable democratic development is to occur. 
 
The approach to Communication for Development (C4D) has evolved over the years. Initially developed after World War II as a tool for diffusion of ideas, communication initiatives primarily involved a one-way transmission of information from the sender to the receiver. This includes large-scale media campaigns, social marketing, dissemination of printed materials, and '[[Entertainment-Education|education-entertainment]]'. Since then, C4D has broadened to incorporate interpersonal communication: face-to-face communication that can either be one-on-one or in small groups. This came alongside the general push for more participatory approaches to development and greater representation of voices from the South. The belief is that while mass media allows for the learning of new ideas, interpersonal networks encourage the shift from knowledge to continued practice.

Communication for development has thus come to be seen as a way to amplify voice, facilitate meaningful participation, and foster social change. The 2006 World Congress on Communication for Development defined C4D as ''{{'}}a social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about seeking change at different levels including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating and learning for sustained and meaningful change{{'}}''. Such two-way, horizontal approaches to communication include public hearings, debates, deliberations and stakeholder consultations, participatory radio and video, community-based theatre and story-telling, and web forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/gender/gender-and-media#changing|title=Gender and media - GSDRC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It encompasses access to and exchange of information, dialogue, creation of knowledge and open access to knowledge, [[development communication]], strategic communication, participatory communication, expressive culture, media, information and communications infrastructure and technologies. 
 
C4D recognises that communication processes often reflect power relations and aims to address this by enabling people's capacities to understand, negotiate and take part in decision-making that affects their lives.

The growing interest in this sector lead to the first [[World Congress on Communication for Development]] organized by the [[FAO]] ComDev Team, The [[World Bank]] and The Communication initiative in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], in October 2006.

'''Communication for Development''' is built around four axes:

[[File:C4D-base4.pdf|thumb|The four axis of Communication for Development]]

# '''Com4Prom''': Communication for Promotion promotes development aid in donor countries to justify how and why development aid resources are spent.
# '''Com4Imple''': Communication for Implementation facilitates the implementation of development aid on developing countries by explaining development programmes to local populations.
# '''Com4Power''': Communication for Empowerment gives power to local population to report on the implementation of the development aid they receive from donor countries.
# '''Com4Coord''': Communication for Coordination allows donor entities to coordinates their activities on a global scale through a series of coordination tools and rules.

==Com4Prom: Promoting development aid in donor countries==

[[File:C4D-infoVScomm.pdf|thumb|How to attract audiences to learn about development aid using positive news and success stories]]

Promotion of cooperation for development in donor countries aims to explain why and how aid programmes funds are spent in developing and emerging countries. The communication targets two audiences: the public at large concerned by general aspects of development and field actors concerned by technical aspects.

Communication strategists in charge of promoting general aspects of development aid among donor countries' citizens consider that Com 4 Prom requires "serious" formats to reach the audience to be produced by journalists and documentaries makers. News mainly focus on things that "go wrong", shaping information as catastrophic. On the other hand, documentaries, even if very interesting and shot with the highest standards, are too frequently tagged as "boring" by broadcasters and consequently pushed in the late hours of week days or early week-end TV grid's slots. Therefore, news create a negative image of development aid, made of tensions and disasters meanwhile documentaries are only seen by few already convinced TV viewers who know what the subject is about. The more people watch information on development aid, the more they feel that nothing changes over the years: the situation is catastrophic, no progress is made. Citizens are driven to despair and turn inactive. This lack of interest and participation facilitates the reduction of development public funding and brings less citizens' support to NGOs.

To reduce the missing link between donors and reality in the field, Com4Prom focuses on Positive Communication, showing successes and concrete results and using trendy and participatory formats that turn audiences into participatory citizens and active consumers. Participatory citizens support cooperation projects in developing countries and volunteer on NGOs' activities. They push governments to implement the 0.7% budget target for development and ask them to support, implement and respect international conventions through multilateral organisations. Active consumers care about their ethical and ecological print, supporting [[fair trade]]. They push corporate companies to implement and extend their [[corporate social responsibility]] programs.

A '''cultural universal''' (also called an '''anthropological universal''' or '''human universal'''), as discussed by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[George Murdock]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and others, is an element, pattern, trait, or institution that is common to all [[human culture]]s worldwide. Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the [[human condition]]. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a [[cultural relativist]] perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited [[ethology|behavior]] is an issue of "[[nature versus nurture]]".

==General==
The emergence of these universals dates to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], with the first evidence of full [[behavioral modernity]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, no source...|date=July 2018}}

==Non-nativist explanations==
The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Language: The cultural tool DL Everett - 2012 - Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;

Since any cultures that have been [[anthropology|studied by anthropologists]] have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological [[research ethics]] slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;Fam Med. 2008 Jan;40(1) Continuing professional development in sensitive cultures. Huntington MK1.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.&lt;ref&gt;Equal Recognition: The Moral Foundations of Minority Rights, Alan Patten 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of [[civilization]] and is therefore not the same thing as [[hyperdiffusionism]], it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of [[innateness]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultures and Globalization: Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation, Helmut K Anheier, Yudhishthir Raj Isar 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication bias in population level universals==
Anthropology's application of one ordinary evidence standard for data that agrees with its theories of cultural universals and one extraordinary standard of evidence for data that disagree with it raises issues with population level [[publication bias]]. While it is possible with strong enough evidence for the validity of one case study that disagree to pass [[peer review]], those that agree will statistically do so more often than those that disagree even if the level of evidence is the same. Since multiple field studies regarding the same culture are combined when statistical prevalences of behaviors are assessed, the result may cause appearances of behaviors having a supposedly universal statistical demographic even if it does not. Some anthropologists suggest that this may give an appearance of statistics such as more men than women hunting large prey being universal without actually being universal, for example that field studies in which more men than women hunted passed peer review while field studies for the same culture in which the genders were equal or inverted for hunting were not published. &lt;ref&gt;"Epidemiology and Culture: Anthropology, Anthropology", CTI Reviews, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluating Scientific Research: Separating Fact from Fiction", Fred Leavitt, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Use of Deadly Force Authorized (5730792058).jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley AFB]]]]

'''Deadly force''', also known as '''lethal force''', is [[use of force]] that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or [[death]] to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a [[wikt:last resort|last resort]], when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.

[[Firearm]]s, [[bladed weapon]]s, [[explosive material|explosive]]s, and [[vehicle]]s are among those [[weapon]]s the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of [[Improvised weapon|non-traditional weapons]] in an offensive manner, such as a [[baseball bat]], sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines deadly force as "force that a person uses causing, or that a person knows or should know would create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily harm or injury".&lt;ref&gt;AFI 31-207 Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', July 2012, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United States]], the use of deadly force by sworn [[law enforcement officers]] is lawful  when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others.  The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public. Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest but this was narrowed in the ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' ruling in 1985 when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] said that "deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others." &lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

In the 1989 ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' ruling, the Supreme Court expanded its definition to include "objective reasonableness" standard—not subjective as to what the officer's intent might have been—and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene—and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Most [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] establish a [[use of force continuum]] starting with simple presence through deadly force. With this model, officers attempt to control subjects and situations with the minimum force necessary. Agencies often have policies limiting the force used to be equal or one step higher on the continuum to the force they are opposing.

A [[civilian]]'s use of deadly force is generally [[justifiable homicide|justified]] if he or she reasonably believe that he or she is or other innocent lives are in imminent danger of death or serious injury.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;  Justification and affirmative defenses vary by state and may include certain property crimes, specific crimes against children or prevention of sexual assaults. 

[[U.S. law]] requires an investigation whenever a person causes another person's death, but the mechanism for such investigations can vary by state. The investigation develops evidence regarding the use of deadly physical force for the particular state or jurisdiction. An investigation may performed by a local or state police agency and also a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt; A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Deadly Force by Law Enforcement Officers|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0074.htm|publisher=Chief Attorney|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation to motor vehicles ===
In {{cite court
  |litigants=Scott v. Harris
  |vol=
  |reporter=
  |opinion=No. 05-1631
  |pinpoint=
  |court=
  |date=April 30, 2007
  |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1631.ZS.html
}}, the (U.S. Supreme Court 2007) held that a police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], even when it places the fleeing [[motorist]] at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the ''Harris'' case, Officer Scott [[PIT maneuver|applied his police car's push bumper to the rear of the suspect's vehicle]], causing the [[suspect]] vehicle to lose control and crash, resulting in the fleeing suspect being paralyzed from the waist down.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Traditionally, intentional contact between vehicles has been characterized as unlawful deadly force, though some U.S. federal appellate cases have mitigated this precedent. In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Adams v. St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department
  |vol=998
  |reporter=F.2d
  |opinion=923
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=1993
}},
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that although fatalities may result from intentional collisions between automobiles such fatalities are infrequent, and therefore unlawful deadly force should not be presumed to be the level of force applied in such incidents; the Adams case was subsequently called into question by
{{cite court
  |litigants=Harris v Coweta County
 |vol=406
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=1307
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=2005
}}, which in turn was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Scott v. Harris'' case discussed above; the extent to which ''Adams'' can continue to be relied on is uncertain. In the ''Adams'' case, the officer rammed the suspect's vehicle.

In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Donovan v. City of Milwaukee
  |vol=17
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=944
  |court=7th Cir.
  |date=1994
}}, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recognized this principle but added that collisions between automobiles and motorcycles frequently lead to the death of the motorcyclist, and therefore a presumption that unlawful deadly force was used in such intentional collisions is more appropriate. In the ''Donovan'' case, the suspect lost control of his motorcycle and became airborne, crashing into the officer's vehicle, which was parked as part of an intercepting roadblock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13029">'''Declinism''' is the belief that a [[society]] or [[institution]] is tending towards [[wiktionary:decline|decline]]. Particularly, it is the predisposition, possibly due to [[cognitive bias]], such as [[rosy retrospection]], to view the past more favourably and future negatively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rZk6DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=Oxford%20declinist&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Political Slang''] edited by Grant Barrett, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etchells|first1=Pete|title=Declinism: is the world actually getting worse?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/jan/16/declinism-is-the-world-actually-getting-worse|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://edge.org/response-detail/26669 |title=The State Of The World Isn't Nearly As Bad As You Think |author=Steven R.

==History==
The belief has been traced back to [[Edward Gibbon]]'s work,&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Laura|title=Culture is dead — again|url=https://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/culture_is_dead_%E2%80%94_again_its_the_end_of_civilization_as_we_know_it_and_maybe_we_feel_fine/|website=Salon|accessdate=17 April 2018|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', published between 1776 and 1788, where Gibbon argues that Rome collapsed due to the gradual loss of [[civic virtue]] among its citizens,&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, "Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian," ''Daedalus'' 105:3 (1976), 153–169; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''EEG'', 303–304; ''FDF'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt; who became lazy, spoiled and inclined to hire foreign [[mercenaries]] to handle the defence of state. He believed that that reason must triumph over superstition to save Europe's superpowers from a similar fate to the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt;

Spengler's book ''The Decline of the West'', which gave Declinism its popular name,&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt; was released in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] and captured the pessimistic spirit of the times. Spengler wrote that history had seen the rise and fall of several "civilizations" (including the Egyptian, the Classical, the Chinese and the Mesoamerican). He claimed these go in cycles, typically spanning 1,000 years. Spengler believed that not only is Western Civilization in decline, but that decline is inevitable.&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt;

==American declinism==
The [[United States]] in particular has a history of predicting its own downfall, beginning with European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funnell|first1=Antony|title=American Declinism: has collective fear finally become reality?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/futuretense/american-declinism/5865146|website=ABC Radio National|accessdate=29 June 2015|date=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; So called '''American declinism''' has been a recurring topic in the [[politics of the United States]] since the 1950s.

“America is prone to bouts of 'declinism,'” ''[[The Economist]]'' has noted. Historian [[Victor Davis Hansen]] has identified several successive stages of American declinism. During the [[Great Depression]], out-of-work Americans viewed the proud, dynamic “New Germany” with envy. In the 1950s, the success of [[Sputnik 1]] and the spread of [[Communism]] led Americans to fear they were falling behind the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1970s, Americans fretted over [[Japan|Japan's]] economic boom; two decades later, the [[European Union]] seemed the wave of the future. In the 21st century, America's worries have focused on the rise of [[China]], with its massive exports and new [[Megacity|megacities]]. Yet one after another of these concerns, Hansen points out, proved unfounded: “[[Fascism]] was crushed; Communism imploded; Japan is aging and shrinking; the European Union is cracking apart.”&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanson|first1=Victor|title=Beware the boom in American "declinism"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/beware-the-boom-in-american-declinism/|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=CBS News|date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 book, [[Thomas L. Friedman]] and [[Michael Mandelbaum]] argued that the United States was in the midst of “its fifth wave of Declinism.” The first had come “with the 'Sputnik Shock' of 1957,” the second with the [[Vietnam War]], the third with [[Jimmy Carter]]’s “malaise” and the rise of Japan, the fourth with the ascendancy of China.&lt;ref name="The American Interest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joffe|first1=Josef|title=Declinism’s Fifth Wave|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/12/09/declinisms-fifth-wave/|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=The American Interest|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American declinism can suddenly overtake commentators who had previously taken a sanguine view of the country's prospects. [[Robert Kagan]] has noted, for example, that the pundit [[Fareed Zakaria]], who in 2004 “described the United States as enjoying a 'comprehensive uni-polarity' unlike anything seen since [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]” had, by 2008, begun “writing about the 'post-American world' and 'the rise of the rest.'”&lt;ref name="New Republic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagan|first1=Robert|title=Not Fade Away|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/99521/america-world-power-declinism|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=New Republic|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a piece which appeared in [[The Nation (United States)|''The Nation'']] on 13 June 2017, author [[Tom Engelhardt]] described [[Donald Trump]] as America's "first declinist candidate for president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engelhardt|first1=Tom|title= Donald Trump Might Set a Record—for the Biggest Decline of American Power in History|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-might-set-a-record-for-the-biggest-decline-of-american-power-in-history/|accessdate=14 June 2017|publisher=''The Nation''|date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Declinism==
Declinism has been found to be rather widespread in the [[United Kingdom]]. In a 2015 survey, 70% of Britons agreed with the statement that “things are worse than they used to be,” even though at the time Britons were in fact “richer, healthier and longer-living than ever before.”&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Jemima|title=Why we yearn for the good old days|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/11349364/Why-we-yearn-for-the-good-old-days.html|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also mentioned that many of the things that older people mourn from their youths were no longer existent in modern society.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

British historian [[Robert Tombs]] suggested that the [[United Kingdom]] has faced several 'bouts' of Declinism, as far back as the 1880s when [[German Empire|German]] competition in manufactured goods was first felt and then again in the 1960s and 1970s, with economic worries, rapid [[decolonisation]] and a perception of dwindling power and influence in every field. Tombs however, concluded that "Declinism is at best a distortion of reality" and denied suggestions that Britain was no longer the great power it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tombs|first1=Robert|title=The myth of Britain’s decline|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/07/the-myth-of-britains-decline/|accessdate=17 April 2018|work=The Spectator|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], declinism has been described as a "booming industry" with popular authors such as [[Michel Onfray]] writing books and articles exploring failings of France and the West.&lt;ref name="NYTFrance"/&gt; French Declinsim has been related to the [[counter-Enlightenment]] of the early 19th century, and also to the late 1970s with the end of three decades of post World War 2 economic growth. In modern times, the phenomenon has picked up velocity and cut across the political spectrum with several variations of  “déclinisme” emerging, from [[Catholic]] [[reactionaries]] to nonreligious thinkers questioning national identity and political corruption.&lt;ref name="NYTFrance"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|title=France’s Obsession With Decline Is a Booming Industry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/books/france-michel-onfray-decadence.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=The New York Times|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Declinism has been described as “a trick of the mind” and as “an emotional strategy, something comforting to snuggle up to when the present day seems intolerably bleak.”&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

One factor in declinism is the so-called “reminiscence bump,” meaning that older people tend “to best remember events that happened to them at around the ages of 10-30.”&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; As one source puts it, “[t]he vibrancy of youth, and the thrill of experiencing things for the first time, creates a 'memory bump' compared with which later life does seem a bit drab.”&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt; Gopnick suggests that “the idea of our decline is emotionally magnetic, because life is a long slide down, and the plateau just passed is easier to love than the one coming up.” Citing the widespread love of “old songs,” he writes: “The long look back is part of the long ride home. We all believe in yesterday.”&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt;

Another factor is the so-called positivity effect, meaning that “as people get older, they tend to experience fewer negative emotions, and they’re more likely to remember positive things over negative things.”

Both of these factors can lead people to experience declinism. But so, contrarily, can the “negativity bias,” meaning that “emotionally negative events are likely to have more impact on your thoughts and behaviours than a similar, but positive, event.”&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

==Function==

Alan W. Dowd quotes [[Samuel P. Huntington]] as saying that declinism “performs a useful historical function” in that it “provides a warning and a goad to action in order to head off and reverse the decline that it says is taking place.” Dowd himself agrees, saying that declinism at its best “is an expression of the American tendency toward self-criticism and continual improvement.”&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Alan|title=Declinism|url=http://www.hoover.org/research/declinism|accessdate=21 December 2016|publisher=Hoover|date=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef Joffe]], on the contrary, emphasizes the fact “that obsessively fretting about your possible decline can be a good way to produce it.”&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt; Similarly, Robert Kagan has expressed concern that Americans are “in danger of committing pre-emptive superpower suicide out of a misplaced fear of their own declining power.”&lt;ref name="New Republic"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Epochalism''' is an attitude of respect for the progressive [[spirit of the age]] and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by [[Clifford Geertz]] with what he termed the ([[Essentialism|essentialist]]) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Culture'' (1973)  p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

The '''exchange of women''' is an element of [[alliance theory]] - the [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and other [[anthropologist]]s who see society as based upon the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] treatment of women as property, being given to other men to cement alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Book and the Text: The Bible and Literary Theory|author=[[Regina Schwartz]]|publisher=Blackwell|year=1990|isbn=0-631-16861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such formal exchange may be seen in the ceremony of the traditional Christian [[wedding]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} in which the [[bride]] is given to the [[Bridegroom|groom]] by her father.

==Kinship==
The structuralist view of kinship was laid out in Lévi-Strauss' grand statement: ''Les Structures élémentaires de la parenté'' (The Elementary Structures of Kinship).  In this, he combined [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]]' ideas about the importance of [[gift]]s in primitive societies with the role of the [[incest]] taboo in forcing exchanges of mates outside of closely related family groups.  The resulting ''exchange of women'' is asymmetric in that men have power over women which is not reciprocated.  The resulting social structures provide a framework for treating the oppression of women as a [[social construct]] rather than being a matter of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trxGYWX_XNgC|title=Feminist Anthropology|chapter=4 The Traffic in Women|author=Gayle Rubin|pages=92–95|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-0196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical patriarchy==
Men in ancient [[Hebrew]] culture established and negotiated their relations with other men through the exchange of female relatives.  This is seen in [[Old Testament]] narratives such as the stories spread across the books of [[Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Sex, Honor and Power in the Deuteronomistic History: A Narratological and Anthropological Analysis|author=Kenneth A. Stone|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1996|isbn=1-85075-640-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal treatment==
In [[Afghanistan]] and remote areas of [[Pakistan]], women may be exchanged in compensation for a debt or offence such as murder.  This practice is known as ''[[Swara (custom)|swara]]''.  Pakistan's constitution prohibits this with a penalty of 3 to 10 years of imprisonment but the custom still persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C07%5C16%5Cstory_16-7-2008_pg11_1|title=Trapped by traditions|author=Sohail Chaudhry|date=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The exchange of women in the course of male bonding appears as a theme in the novels ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and ''[[Tropic of Capricorn (novel)|Tropic of Capricorn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.henry-miller.com/narrative-literature/a-generalized-exchange-of-women.html|title=Henry Miller and the Rise of New Critical Modernism|chapter=7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">An '''eye poke''', '''eye jab''', '''eye stab''', '''eye strike''' or '''poke in the eye''' is a strike at the eye or eyes of a human or animal.  It is typically made with the fingers which may either be forked to jab both eyes or held together, like a bird's beak, to strike with force and protect the fingers from damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Eye Jab |page=60 |title=Martial Arts Techniques for Law Enforcement |author=Mike Young |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8048-3794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=32 |title=Complete Krav Maga |chapter=Eye Strike |author=Darren Levine, John Whitman |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-56975-573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack became better known among the public due to its use in comedy; the idea of using it to entertain was likely invented by the [[vaudeville]]  duo of [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]] and [[Lew Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Lawrence J.|title=Mixed nuts: America's love affair with comedy teams : from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6YQTuBYQ8C&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=1-58648-190-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self defense==
In a street fight situation, when one's opponent may be trying to inflict serious harm, martial arts expert [[Kelly McCann]] advises that the eyes should be a "persistent primary target".&lt;ref name = "kelly"/&gt; An eye poke needs little power to be effective, and it can stop even highly determined attackers. If the hand is kept at an approximately 45° angle to the opponent's face during the strike, there is less risk of hurting ones fingers, and even if they do not connect with the eye, the palm can impact on the opponent's face.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;''Combatives for street survival '', by [[Kelly McCann]], Black Belt Books, {{ISBN|0-89750-176-4}}, (2010, second edition) p 126&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Perhaps not a well known source to the average academic, this is considered one of the most authoritative books on street fighting, its been enthusiastically endorsed by celebrated warriors including [[Alfred M.

==Comedy==

The '''history of organized firefighting''' began in ancient Rome while under the rule of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wHEGcPZZmHwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=ancient+roman+fire+sale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yqgq4pMZ7A&amp;sig=bGNPGAlSV3GHEi4IuqxuCjTiyIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qvVyUJPNA-rY2AXvpoCQBQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20roman%20fire%20sale&amp;f=false Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caeser,  M. Dillon] Accessed: 10/6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, there is evidence of fire-fighting machinery in use in Ancient Egypt, including a water pump invented by [[Ctesibius]] of Alexandria in the third century BC which was later improved upon in a design by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in the first century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cEQQ5-wadbUC Fire Fighting Pumping Systems At Industrial Facilities, D. Nolan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rome==

The first ever Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) "fire and rapine." One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the ''[[Vigiles]]'' in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.

Rome suffered a number of serious fires, most notably the fire on [[Great_Fire_of_Rome|19 July AD 64]] which eventually destroyed two thirds of Rome.

[[Image:Firefighters Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This picture published in 1808 shows firefighters tackling a fire in [[London]] using hand-pumped engines.]]
In [[Europe]], firefighting was quite rudimentary until the 17th century. In 1254, a royal decree of King [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] of France created the so-called ''guet bourgeois'' ("burgess watch"), allowing the residents of Paris to establish their own night watches, separate from the king's night watches, to prevent and stop crimes and fires. After the [[Hundred Years' War]], the population of Paris expanded again, and the city, much larger than any other city in Europe at the time, was the scene of several great fires in the 16th century. As a consequence, King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] disbanded the residents' night watches and left the king's watches as the only one responsible for checking crimes and fires.

[[London]] suffered [[Early fires of London|great fires]] in 798, 982, 989, 1212 and above all in 1666 (the [[Great Fire of London]]). The Great Fire of 1666 started in a baker's shop on Pudding Lane, consumed about two square miles (5&amp;nbsp;km²) of the city, leaving tens of thousands homeless. Prior to this fire, London had no organized fire protection system. Afterwards, insurance companies formed private fire brigades to protect their clients’ property. Insurance brigades would only fight fires at buildings the company insured. These buildings were identified by [[fire insurance marks]]. 
The key breakthrough in firefighting arrived in the 17th century with the first fire engines. Manual pumps, rediscovered in Europe after 1500 (allegedly used in [[Augsburg]] in 1518 and in Nuremberg in 1657), were only [[force pump]]s and had a very short range due to the lack of hoses. [[Germany|German]] inventor [[Hans Hautsch]] improved the [[manual pump]] by creating the first [[suction and force pump]] and adding some flexible hoses to the pump. In 1672, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist and inventor [[Jan Van der Heyden]]'s workshop developed the [[fire hose]]. Constructed of flexible [[leather]] and coupled every 50 feet (15 m) with [[brass]] fittings. The length remains the standard to this day in mainland Europe whilst in the UK the standard length is either 23m or 25m. 
The [[fire apparatus|fire engine]] was further developed by the Dutch inventor, merchant and manufacturer, [[John Lofting]] (1659–1742) who had worked with Jan Van der Heyden in Amsterdam. Lofting moved to London in or about 1688, became an English citizen and patented (patent number 263/1690) the "Sucking Worm Engine" in 1690. There was a glowing description of the firefighting ability of his device in The London Gazette of 17 March 1691, after the issue of the patent. 
The British Museum has a print showing Lofting's fire engine at work in London, the engine being pumped by a team of men. In the print three fire plaques of early insurance companies are shown, no doubt indicating that Lofting collaborated with them in firefighting. A later version of what is believed to be one of his fire engines has been lovingly restored by a retired firefighter, and is on show in Marlow Buckinghamshire where John Lofting moved in 1700. Patents only lasted for fourteen years and so the field was open for his competitors after 1704. 
 
[[Richard Newsham]] of Bray in Berkshire (just 8 miles from Lofting) produced and patented an improved engine in 1721 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon dominated the fire engine market in England. Pulled as a cart to the fire, these manual pumps were manned by teams of 4 to 12 men and could deliver up to 160 gallons per minute (12 L/s) at up to 120 feet (36 m). Newsham himself died in 1743 but his company continued making fire engines under other managers and names into the 1770s. The next major development in fire engine design in England was made by Hadley, Simpkin &amp; Lott co. in 1792 with a larger and much improved style of hand pumped engine which could be pulled to a fire by horses.

In 1631, [[Boston]]'s governor [[John Winthrop]] outlawed wooden chimneys and thatched roofs.&lt;ref name="FIR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firefightercentral.com/history/firefighting_in_colonial_america.htm|title=Firefighting In Colonial America|last=|first=|date=|website=Fire Fighter Central|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610030631/http://www.firefightercentral.com/history/firefighting_in_colonial_america.htm|archive-date=2007-06-10|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, the [[New Amsterdam]] governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]] appointed four men to act as fire wardens.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; They were empowered to inspect all chimneys and to fine any violators of the rules. The city burghers later appointed eight prominent citizens to the "Rattle Watch" - these men volunteered to patrol the streets at night carrying large wooden rattles.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; If a fire was seen, the men spun the rattles, then directed the responding citizens to form bucket brigades. On January 27, 1678 the first fire engine company went into service with its captain (foreman) Thomas Atkins.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; In 1736 [[Benjamin Franklin]] established the [[Union Fire Company]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt;

The United States did not have government-run fire departments until around the time of the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to this time, private fire brigades  competed with one another to be the first to respond to a fire because [[insurance company|insurance companies]] paid brigades to save buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013408/http://www.afirepro.com/history.html|title=A Fire Pro - History of Fire Fighting|website=www.afirepro.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwriters also employed their own [[Salvage Corps]] in some cities.  The first known female firefighter [[Molly Williams]] took her place with the men on the dragropes during the blizzard of 1818 and pulled the pumper to the fire through the deep snow.

On April 1 of 1853, Cincinnati, Ohio featured the first professional fire department made up of 100% full-time employees.

In 2015, 70 percent of firefighters in the United States were volunteer. Only 4% of calls were actual fires. 64% were medical aid. 8% were false alarms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org//~/media/files/news-and-research/fire-statistics/fact-sheets/usfireservicefactsheet.pdf The United States Fire Service Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
The first fire brigades in the modern sense were created in [[France]] in the early 18th century. In 1699, a man with bold commercial ideas, [[François du Mouriez du Périer]] (grandfather of [[French Revolution]] general [[Charles François Dumouriez]]), solicited an audience with King [[Louis XIV]]. Greatly interested in Jan Van der Heyden's invention, he successfully demonstrated the new pumps and managed to convince the king to grant him the monopoly of making and selling "fire-preventing portable pumps" throughout the kingdom of France. François du Mouriez du Périer offered 12 pumps to the City of Paris, and the first Paris Fire Brigade, known as the ''Compagnie des gardes-pompes'' (literally the "[[Company (military unit)|Company]] of Pump Guards"), was created in 1716. François du Mouriez du Périer was appointed ''directeur des pompes de la Ville de Paris'' ("director of the City of Paris's pumps"), i.e. chief of the Paris Fire Brigade, and the position stayed in his family until 1760. In the following years, other fire brigades were created in the large French cities. Around that time appeared the current French word ''pompier'' ("firefighter"), whose literal meaning is "pumper." On March 11, 1733 the French government decided that the interventions of the fire brigades would be free of charge. This was decided because people always waited until the last moment to call the fire brigades to avoid paying the fee, and it was often too late to stop fires. From 1750 on, the French fire brigades became para-military units and received uniforms. In 1756 the use of a protective helmet for firefighters was recommended by King [[Louis XV]], but it took many more years before the measure was actually enforced on the ground.

In [[North America]], [[Jamestown, Virginia]] was virtually destroyed in a fire in January, 1608. There were no full-time paid firefighters in America until 1850. Even after the formation of paid fire companies in the United States, there were disagreements and often fights over territory. [[New York City]] companies were famous for sending runners out to fires with a large barrel to cover the hydrant closest to the fire in advance of the engines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.windsorfire.com/a-brief-history-of-firefighting/|title=A Brief History of Firefighting - WindsorFire.com|date=2006-01-22|work=WindsorFire.com|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often fights would break out between the runners and even the responding fire companies for the right to fight the fire and receive the insurance money that would be paid to the company that fought it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 19th century and early 20th century volunteer fire companies served not only as fire protection but as political machines. The most famous volunteer firefighter politician is [[Boss Tweed]], head of the notorious [[Tammany Hall]] political machine, who got his start in politics as a member of the Americus Engine Company Number 6 ("The Big Six") in New York City.

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], drawing from the century-old experience of the ''gardes-pompes'', is generally attributed as creating the first "professional" firefighters, known as [[Sapeurs-Pompiers]] ("[[Sapper]]s-Firefighters"), from the [[French Army]]. Created under the Commandant of Engineers in 1810, the company was organized after a fire at the ballroom in the Austrian Embassy in Paris which injured several dignitaries.

In the UK, the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 set in motion changes which laid the foundations for organised firefighting in the future. In the wake of the Great Fire, the City Council established the first fire insurance company, "The Fire Office", in 1667, which employed small teams of Thames [[watermen]] as firefighters and provided them with uniforms and arm badges showing the company to which they belonged.

However, the first organised municipal fire brigade in the world was established in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], when the Edinburgh Fire Engine Establishment was formed in 1824, led by [[James Braidwood (firefighter)|James Braidwood]]. London followed in 1832 with the [[London Fire Brigade|London Fire Engine Establishment]].

On April 1, 1853, the [[Cincinnati Fire Department]] became the first full-time paid professional fire department in the United States, and the first in the world to use steam fire engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/fire/about-fire/history/|title=History - Fire|website=City of Cincinnati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first horse-drawn steam engine for fighting fires was invented in 1829, but not accepted in structural firefighting until 1860, and ignored for another two years afterwards. Internal combustion engine fire engines arrived in 1907, built in the United States, leading to the decline and disappearance of steam engines by 1925.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4672">'''Hybrid navigation''' is the simultaneous use of more than one [[navigation system]] for location data determination, needed for [[navigation]]. By using multiple systems at once, the accuracy as a whole is improved. Especially for [[autonomous car|self-driving cars]], the exact and continuous knowledge of the navigating object's location is essential.&lt;ref name=HNN1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/news/autonomes-fahren-wer-hat-die-besten-karten-1509-115506.html|title=AUTONOMES FAHREN: Wer hat die besten Karten?|editor=golem | author= Friedhelm Greis | date=2015-09-02 | language=de| accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
&lt;!-- need ref to support that GPS is the main/best/most-general one and others are only added to augment it --&gt;
[[GPS]] or other satellite based systems ([[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|GALILEO]], [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BEIDOU]], [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System|QZSS]]) provide a way to learn one's location, but these methods require [[free field]] conditions in order to receive the radio signal. Various satellite systems are subject to switching-off or reduction of data precision by the company or government that runs them.&lt;ref name=AAHN1 /&gt; They are also prone to intentional or unintentional disturbances. Even passing through a tunnel or a garage interrupts the data flow. In situations where the signal cannot be received reliably, alternate sources of location data are needed. Combining GPS with other methods can avoid these limitations, but each method has its own specific limitations. A hybrid system provides [[fault tolerance]] for each underlying method and improves the overall precision of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanborn.com/highly-automated-driving-maps-for-autonomous-vehicles/| title=HIGHLY AUTOMATED DRIVING (HAD) MAPS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES| accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid system needs to decide how to choose among the different methods at any given time. One solution is a triple configuration, allowing 'result voting' for data collecting systems.&lt;ref  name="AAHN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/2145 | title=Aviation Applications: Hybrid Navigation Techniques and Safety-of-Life Requirements |author=Bestmann, vonWulfen, Hecker, Kneissl, Kropp | date=August 2010 | accessdate= 2016-07-17 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICON1&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple criteria decision making : proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference |editor1= Günter Fandel|editor2=Tomas Gal, Thomas Hanne |author=Johannes Jahn|chapter=Optimality Conditions in Set Valued Vector Optimation |pages=22 |location=New York |publisher= Springer-Verlag |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alternate systems that supply navigational data include:
* [[Inertial navigation system]]s. This system determines location by summing the movement vectors from start of the trip or some other [[waypoint]] whose location is well-defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/how-does-inertial-navigation-work |title=How Does Inertial Navigation Work? |editor= Hydro International|date= 2011-01-27 |author=Leendert Dorst | language=en|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Incremental sensors. This system uses vehicle speed data supplied by a [[Fleet Management System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honeynav.com/etak/Etak%20paper%20RIN%20York%201985.pdf|title=NAV85 Papers|author=Stanley K.

* [[Differential Global Positioning System|Differential GPS]]. This system uses [[terrestrial radio]] transmitters with well-defined locations that broadcast information about how accurate the GPS signals are at identifying the locations of these transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernavionics.com/blog/bid/43197/What-is-DGPS-or-Differential-GPS|title=What is DGPS or Differential GPS?|author= Brooks Goodhue | date= 2011-05-09 |language=en| accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">'''Interactive communication''' is an exchange of ideas where both participants, whether human, machine or art form, are active and can have an effect on one another. It is a [[:wikt:dynamic|dynamic]], two-way flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.elprofesionaldelainformacion.com/contenidos/2016/mar/06.pdf|title = A profile of the interactive communication professional foundations, current trends and perspectives|last = Soler-Adillon|first = Joan|date = 2016|website = Elprofesionaldelainformacion.com|publisher = Elprofesionaldelainformacion|access-date = 30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many forms of [[communication]] previously thought one-way, like books and television, have become [[interactive]] with the rise of computers, the Internet, and digital and mobile devices. These developing collaborative technologies, or [[new media]], have rapidly increased the opportunities for interactive communication across mediums, disciplines, cultures, social classes, locations, and even time. 

Interactive communication is a modern term that encompasses these evolving forms of [[conversation]]. It is a primary characteristic of the present [[Information Age]]. New experiments in [[interaction design]] are evolving on a daily basis. 

Interactive communication forms include basic dialogue and [[nonverbal communication]], [[gamebooks|game-books]], interactive fiction and storytelling, [[hypertext]], interactive television and movies, photo and video manipulation, [[video sharing]], video games, social media, [[user-generated content]], interactive marketing and public relations, [[augmented reality]], [[ambient intelligence]], and virtual reality. 

==History of Interactivity==
Interactivity is rooted in basic communication, the development of [[rhetoric]], and the evolution of [[social interface]]. Gesture, touch and [[body language]] were the earliest forms of communication. The time line of spoken and written language’s emergence is still under debate. Rhetoric is the effective use of language.

Once human [[cognition]] and thought evolved, varieties of language and communication increased exponentially. Braille and [[sign language]] are forms of interface, as are the arts of [[music]], cooking, photography and [[fashion]]. Politics, trade, [[international relations]], immigration and war are examples of group interaction. 

[[Industrial design]], the aesthetics and engineering of human and machine interface, arrived with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Examples of perfected [[usability]] include the chopstick, the corkscrew and the paper clip. The automobile dashboard, the iconic [[Fender Stratocaster]] electrical guitar, and popular telephones from the Western Electric [[Model 302 telephone|Model 302]] rotary dial to the Apple iPhone multi-touch screen are examples of effective [[Control panel (engineering)|control panels]]. 

Interest in interactive communication has grown with the increase in [[human-computer interaction]]. Hardware peripherals include keyboards, [[Computer mouse|mice]], game controllers and webcams. [[Graphical user interface]] examples include the [[desktop metaphor]], software programs like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop, websites and web browsers, search engines, and the increasing number of smartphone [[mobile applications]]. 

An important consideration in the development of any modern [[user interface]] is its interactivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">In [[communication studies]], the notion of an '''interface''' in the work environment is used for a point of interaction between a number of systems or work groups. In the manufacturing environment, the coordination and interaction between several work groups is used to communicate plans and control production activity. This interaction can be schedules, [[human interaction]]s, [[computer systems]], or any other medium of communication. A physical interface is the interconnection between two items of hardware or machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Sharia]] or sharia law is the basic Islamic [[religious law]] derived from the religious precepts of [[Islam]], particularly the [[Quran]] and the opinions and life example of [[Muhammad]] ([[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]]) which are the primary [[sources of sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionar Definition of sharia in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L.

The derivation differs between the various [[Islamic schools and branches|sects of Islam]] ([[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]].&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;Hisham M.

The first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (see [[Justice in the Quran]]), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aboul-Enein|first1=H.

Some have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only [[Separation of church and state#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|first legislated into effect]] after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world.&lt;ref name="church state evolution"&gt;[http://counterjihad.com/separation-church-state-west-sharia "Separation of Church and State: In the West and Under Sharia"] By Immanuel Al-Manteeqi.

Islam has never had any officially recognized tradition of [[pacifism]], and throughout its history warfare has been an integral part of the Islamic theological system.&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time of Muhammad, Islam has considered warfare to be a legitimate expression of religious faith, and has accepted its use for the defense of Islam.&lt;ref&gt; name=Zuhur&gt;Aboul-Enein, H.

While the early spread of Islam was often borne on the back of military conquest, within Christianity its early spread was often a matter of political expediency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyandscripture.org/Issue3-1/Adams/Adams.html "Paul and the Government of the Soul"] Journal of Philosophy and Scripture.

Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies. Some hold that the formal juristic definition of [[Islam and war|war in Islam]] constitutes an irrevokable and permanent link within Islam between the political and religious justifications for war.&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quranic concept of ''[[Jihad]]'' includes aspects of both a physical and an internal struggle.&lt;ref name="morgan2010"/&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Berkey]], jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagans]] of Mecca or the [[Banu Qurayza|Jews of Medina]], but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared.&lt;ref name="Berkey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkey|first=Jonathan Porter|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58813-3|page=73|quote=The Koran is not a squeamish document, and exhort the believers to jihad. Verses such as "Do not follow the unbelievers, but struggle against them mightily" (25.52) and "fight [those who have been given a revelation] who do not believe in God  and the last day" (9.29) may originally have been directed against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but could be redirected once a new set of enemies appeared.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of the law of Jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani]].

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Muhammad in Medina|Medina]] from [[Muhammad in Mecca|Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was [[Al-Hajj|surah 22]], verses 39–40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt;
The main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.&lt;ref name="DavidCook2005"&gt;David Cook, ''Understanding Jihad''; University of California Press: CA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Edwards and [[Sherifa Zuhur]], offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant "no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them." Jihad as a collective duty (''[[Fard]] Kifaya'') and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an "individually incumbent jihad" (''Fard Ayn'') required only "awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Richard |last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and|page=553|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=jihad+declared+by+caliph&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIh7D86LCfyAIVFxKSCh1bnQiW#v=onepage&amp;q=jihad%20declared%20by%20caliph&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Magaard, associate professor at the [[Aarhus University]] Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world. In an interview, she stated that the basic texts of Islam call for violence and aggression against followers of other faiths to a greater extent than texts of other religions. She has also argued that they contain direct incitements to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE5097347/Islam-er-den-mest-krigeriske-religion/|title=Islam er den mest krigeriske religion|date=Oct 9, 2005|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Main article|Caravan raids|Ghazi (warrior)}}
[[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] ([[Wiktionary:ghazi|غازي]]) is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa,"''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1428910395&amp;id=5F-JEmNr9yUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Islamic Rulings on Warfare'']", Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, {{ISBN|1-4289-1039-5}} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caravan raids]] were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his [[Sahabah|companions]] participated. The raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] financed by the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]].&lt;ref name="Watt1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV7uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raids were intended to weaken the economy of [[Mecca]] by Muhammad. His followers were also impoverished.&lt;ref name="Gabriel2007"/&gt; Muhammad broke an Arab tradition of not attacking one's own kinsmen by raiding caravans.&lt;ref name="Gabriel2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A.

Islamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the '[[sword verses]]' and the 'peace verses'".  According to Matthews, "the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war."&lt;ref name=Mathewes&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Religious Ethics |first=Charles T. |last=Mathewes|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyCsZE_iHp4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dipak Gupta, "much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul [[Kufr]]) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic “sword verses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=

On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context,&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-rohan.sdsu.edu"&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Qur'an that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime." {{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheline R. Ishay has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is "strictly limited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/uk/newsletters/2002/0302ukbulletin.pdf Article on Jihad] by Dr. G. W. Leitner (founder of The Oriental Institute, UK) published in Asiatic Quarterly Review, 1886. ("Jihad, even when explained as a righteous effort of waging war in self defense against the grossest outrage on one's religion, is strictly limited..")&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Leaman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|authorlink=Oliver Leaman|title=Jewish Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLKcZuGCQ4C&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08868-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all [[Hudna|peace treaties]] that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shariʻa as discourse: legal traditions and the encounter with Europe |first1=Jørgen S.|last1=Nielsen |first2=Lisbet |last2=Christoffersen |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2010 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJ_t0F7ZGEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Quran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22sword%20verses%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0vYYovH7OQC&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his oppressors in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more defensive perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; From that point onward, those dubious about the need to go to war were typically portrayed as lazy cowards allowing their love of peace to become a [[Fitna (word)|fitna]] to them.&lt;ref name="church"&gt;Churchill, Robert Paul.

====Hadiths====
{{Main article|Jihad in Hadith}}
{{See also|Criticism of Hadith}}
The context of the Quran is elucidated by Hadith (the teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad). Of the 199 references to jihad in perhaps the most standard collection of hadith—[[Sahih Bukhari|Bukhari]]—all refer to warfare.&lt;ref name=bukhari&gt;Muhammad ibn Isma'il Bukhari, The Translation of the Meaning of Sahih al-Bukhari, trans.

===== Quranism =====

[[Quranists]] reject the hadith and follow the Quran only.

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad|Ahmadiyya#Abrogation|Persecution of Ahmadis}}

According to [[Ahmadi]] Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: ''Jihad al-Akbar'' (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; ''Jihad al-Kabīr'' (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the ''pen''; ''Jihad al-Asghar'' (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archivedate=2012-04-14 | title=Suspension of Jihad | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Ross Valentine|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2008|publisher=C.

{{Quote|As far as Islam is concerned, it categorically rejects and condemns every form of terrorism. It does not provide any cover or justification for any act of violence, be it committed by an individual, a group or a government.}}

Various Ahmadis scholars, such as [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]] and [[Basharat Ahmad]], argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionofislam.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the "unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān".&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;[[Yohanan Friedmann|Friedmann]], ''Jihād in Ahmadī Thought'', {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī ''[[fiqh]]'', so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific [[asbab al-nuzul|situation for which it was revealed]]), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="Friedmann"/&gt;

Ahmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised [[Mahdi]] and [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/3in1/chap2/index.html | title=An Enemy a Disbeliever a Liar, Claims of Hadhrat Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Naeem Osman Memon | year=1994 |isbn=1-85372-552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/reflection.html | title=Truth about Ahmadiyyat, Reflection of all the Prophets |publisher=London Mosque | author=B.A Rafiq | year=1978 |isbn=0-85525-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirza Tahir Ahmad 1998"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_7_section_1.html | title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth, Future of Revelation|publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | authorlink=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | year=1998 |isbn=1-85372-640-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Lago|title=The Handbook of Transcultural Counselling and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-23851-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of [[Persecution of religious minorities by Muslims|religious persecution]], [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm "Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography".] Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and crime===
{{Main article|Islamic criminal jurisprudence|Hudud|Qisas|Tazir}}

The Islamic criminal law is [[criminal law]] in accordance with Sharia. Strictly speaking, Islamic law does not have a distinct corpus of "criminal law."

Zina only applies for unlawful sex between free Muslims; the rape of a non-Muslim slave woman is not zina as the act is considered an offense not against the raped slave woman, but against the owner of the slave.&lt;ref name=ae2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=keciali/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=28 February 2016|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zina and rape laws of countries under Sharia law are the subjects of a global human rights debate and one of many items of reform and secularization debate with respect to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;LAU, M.

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud—seen as crime against [[Allah]]; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;A.

==Terrorism==

{{Islamism sidebar}}
[[Islamic terrorism]] is, by definition, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or [[Islamism|Islamist]] motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, [[Islam and Pedophilia|child-molestation]] and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK |author=Greg Botelho|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in [[Terrorism in the European Union|Europe]], [[Terrorism in Russia|Russia]], and the [[Terrorism in the United States|United States]], and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/isis-ideology-islamic-militants-british-appeal-iraq-syria|title=Isis: a contrived ideology justifying barbarism and sexual control|author=Mona Siddiqui|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/kurdish-peshmerga-kobani-isis-syria|title=Kurdish peshmerga forces arrive in Kobani to bolster fight against Isis|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; state actors and their [[proxy war|proxies]], and politically liberal Muslim protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388593/moderate-muslims-stand-against-isis-christine-sisto|title=Moderate Muslims Stand against ISIS |author=Christine Sisto|work=National Review Online|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pacifism in Islam ==
Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and [[Islam and war|warfare]] has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more violent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of Islam==
===Negative perceptions===
Philip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a [[stereotype]] of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the [[Western world]] as "dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resurgent Islam: a sociological approach |first1=Philip W. |last1=Sutton |first2=Stephen |last2=Vertigans |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |page=7 |quote=Stereotypical views which portray Islam as an inherently violent religion, a 'religion of the sword' and an increasing global threat have thus been reinforced and even extended over recent years. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhx1XlbhFhgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QN4FTaL-Jo7msQOepuWODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Eduardo Campo writes that, "Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Campo |page=374 |publisher = Infobase Publishing| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gleave writes that, "at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials."&lt;ref name="HinnellsKing2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hinnells|author2=Richard King|title=Religion and Violence in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb1OBi3zvdkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08869-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack on the US]] has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times|first=Ram |last=Puniyani |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X30ETYusGcq-nAfihpnmDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corrigan and Hudson, "some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in America: an historical account of the development of American religious life |first1=John|last1=Corrigan |first2=Winthrop Still |last2=Hudson |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |year=2004 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;dq=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TdQFTa6ZAY72tgPb9aDHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[evangelical Christian]]s who have expressed such sentiments include [[Franklin Graham]], an [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[missionary]], and [[Pat Robertson]], an American [[media mogul]], [[executive chairman]], and a former [[Southern Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Nation Challenged: The Religious Right; Islam Is Violent in Nature, Pat Robertson Says |publisher=New York Times |date=23 February 2002 |quote=The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has described Islam as a"violent religion that wants to 'dominate and then, if need be, destroy'."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/23/us/nation-challenged-religious-right-islam-violent-nature-pat-robertson-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey conducted by [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]], a research group affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that two out of three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastors believe that Islam is a "dangerous" religion.

Dr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabistjansen.nl/Arabist/pub_list_Engl_files/RelRootsMusViol.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Framing Islam: An Analysis of U.S. Media Coverage of Terrorism Since 9/11|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=62|pages=90-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed "through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations" (Powell 94)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The key findings are summarized below: 
* The media coverage of terrorism in the U.S. feeds a culture of fear of Islam and describes  the United States as a good Christian nation (Powell 105). 
* A clear pattern of reporting had been detected that differentiates "terrorists who were Muslim with international ties and terrorists who were U.S. citizens with no clear international ties" (Powell 105). This was utilized to frame "war of Islam on the United States".
* "Muslim Americans are no longer ‘‘free’’ to practice and to name their religion without fear of prosecution, judgment, or connection to terrorism." (Powell 107)

Hill and Bernard Spilka write in ''The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach'', "Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach|first1=Ralph W. |last1=Hood |first2=Peter C.|last2=Hill |first3=Bernard |last3=Spilka |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2009|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETVk59xbc90C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZbcFTb21G4uosAOp3ZiKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Chandra Muzaffar]], a [[political scientist]], [[Liberal Muslim movements#Reform|Islamic reformist]] and [[activist]], says, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rights, religion and reform: enhancing human dignity through spiritual and moral transformation |first=Chandra |last=Muzaffar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002|page=345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQA02NT6tmAC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Quran+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-C8HTdGqOoOusAPNn4DZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
[[Pew Research Center|Pew research]] in 2010 found that in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Nigeria]], roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of [[Hezbollah]], and that [[Hamas]] also saw similar support.&lt;ref name=PewDivided&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/|title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah|date=2 December 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-terrorism]] researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall |title=Researcher: Suicide terrorism linked to military occupation - Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[National Post]], [[Barbara Kay]] stated that [[honor killing]] is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including [[sexism]], dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by "Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[Continue calling ‘honour killings’ by its rightful name, Barbara Kay, September 21, 2011, Full comment, National Post.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center also found that support for the [[Islam and capital punishment|death penalty]] as punishment for "people who leave the Muslim religion" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries.&lt;ref name=PewDivided/&gt; The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.

According to 2006 data, Pew says that 46% of [[Islam in Nigeria|Nigerian Muslims]], 29% of [[Islam in Jordan|Jordan Muslims]], 28% of [[Islam in Egypt|Egyptian Muslims]], 15% of [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslims]], and 8% of [[Islam in the United States|American Muslims]] thought suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified.&lt;ref name=PewMuslimAmericans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf|title=Muslim Americans – Middle class and mostly mainstream|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Pew Research Center|page=60|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was unchanged – still 8% – for American Muslims by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/|title=Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism|date=30 August 2011|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/Muslim-Americans-No-Justification-Violence.aspx|title=Most Muslim Americans See No Justification for Violence|publisher=gallup.com|date=2 August 2011|author=Nicole Naurath|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/|title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East|publisher=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gallup poll====
Gallup poll collected extensive data in a project called "Who Speaks for Islam?". [[John Esposito]] and [[Dalia Mogahed]] present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) &lt;ref name=GallupEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307065817/http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-07|title=FAQs: Who Speaks for Islam?|publisher=gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be "perfectly justified" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims "Politically Radicalized".&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt; They chose that title "because of their radical political orientation" and clarify "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=GallupRadical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104941/what-makes-radical.aspx|publisher=Gallup.com|title=What Makes a Radical?|author=Gallup Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.&lt;ref name=GallupRadical/&gt;

The authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims "Moderates". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks ''almost'' cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called "[[Political radicalism|Politically Radicalized]]". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt;

'''James Haughton''' (5 May 1795 – 20 February 1873) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] social reformer and temperance activist.

==Life==
Haughton, son of Samuel Pearson Haughton (1748–1828), by Mary, daughter of James Pim of Rushin, Queen's County (now [[County Laois]]), Ireland, was born in [[Carlow]] and educated at Ballitor, [[County Kildare]], from 1807 to 1810, under James White, a quaker. After filling several situations to learn his business, in 1817 he settled in [[Dublin]], where he became a corn and flour factor, in partnership with his brother William. He retired in 1850. Although educated as a Friend, he joined the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in 1834, and remained throughout his life a strong believer in their tenets.

He supported the anti-slavery movement at an early period and took an active part in it until 1838, going in that year to London as a delegate to a convention. Shortly after the [[temperance movement|Temperance]] campaigner, [[Father Mathew]], took the pledge, 10 April 1838, Haughton became one of his most devoted disciples. For many years he gave most of his time and energies to promoting total abstinence and to advocating legislative restrictions on the sale of intoxicating drinks.

In December 1844 he was the chief promoter of a fund which was raised to pay some of the debts of Father Mathew and release him from prison. About 1835 he commenced a series of letters in the public press which made his name widely known. He wrote on temperance, [[slavery]], [[British India]], peace, [[capital punishment]], sanitary reform, and education. His first letters were signed ‘The Son of a Water Drinker,’ but he soon commenced using his own name and continued to write till 1872. He took a leading part in a series of weekly meetings which were held in Dublin in 1840, when so numerous were the social questions discussed that a newspaper editor called the speakers the "Anti-everythingarians". In association with [[Daniel O'Connell]], of whose character he had a very high opinion, he advocated various plans for the amelioration of the condition of Ireland and the [[Repeal Association|Repeal of the Union]], but was always opposed to physical force. He became a vegetarian in 1846, both on moral and sanitary grounds. For two or three years before his death he was president of the Vegetarian Society of the United Kingdom. He was one of the first members of the Statistical Society of Dublin, 1847, a founder of the Dublin Mechanics' Institute, 1849, in the same year was on the committee of the Dublin Peace Society, aided in abolishing [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook Fair]] 1855, and took a chief part in 1861 in opening the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens|Botanic Gardens]] at Glasnevin on Sundays.

He died at 35 Eccles Street, Dublin, on 20 Feb. 1873, and was buried in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]] 24 Feb. in the presence of an immense crowd of people.

His son, Samuel Haughton published a memoir of his father's life including extracts from his public correspondence in 1877.  The scientist Samuel Haughton was a half nephew of James Haughton.  Samuel Haughton was the second son of Samuel Haughton (a son of Samuel Pierson Haughton and his second wife, Jane Boake)

Holdren was involved in the famous [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]] in 1980. He, along with two other scientists helped [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] establish the bet with [[Julian Simon]], in which they bet that the price of five key metals would be higher in 1990. The bet was centered around a disagreement concerning the future scarcity of resources in an increasingly polluted and heavily populated world. Ehrlich and Holdren lost the bet, when the price of metals had decreased by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was chair of the Executive Committee of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] from 1987 until 1997 and delivered the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture on behalf of Pugwash Conferences in December 1995. From 1993 until 2003, he was chair of the [[Committee on International Security and Arms Control]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and Co-Chairman of the bipartisan National Committee on Energy Policy from 2002 until 2007. Holdren was elected [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) (2006–2007), and served as board Chairman (2007–2008).&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He was the founding chair of the advisory board for ''[[Innovations (journal)|Innovations]]'', a quarterly journal about entrepreneurial solutions to global challenges published by MIT Press, and has written and lectured extensively on the topic of [[global warming]].

===Writings===
[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] was an early concern and interest. In a 1969 article, Holdren and co-author [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] argued, "if the population control measures are not initiated immediately, and effectively, all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPanaceas"&gt;Paul R. Erlich and John P. Holdren. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1294858 "Population and Panaceas A Technological Perspective"], ''Bioscience'', Vol 19, pages 1065-1071, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Holdren encouraged a decline in fertility to well below replacement in the United States, because "210 million now is too many and 280 million in 2040 is likely to be much too many."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPredicament"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7jjp9bv0qNYC&amp;dq=no+growth+society&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA31,M1 | journal = Daedalus, the No-Growth Society | year = 1973 | title = Population and the American Predicament: The Case Against Complacency | first = John P. | isbn = 978-0-7130-0136-5 | last = Holdren | pages = 31&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Paul R. Ehrlich, [[Anne H. Ehrlich]], and Holdren co-authored the textbook ''[[Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment]]''.
Other early publications include ''Energy'' (1971), ''Human Ecology'' (1973), ''Energy in Transition'' (1980), ''Earth and the Human Future'' (1986), ''Strategic Defenses and the Future of the Arms Race'' (1987), ''Building Global Security Through Cooperation (1990)'', and ''Conversion of Military R&amp;D'' (1998).&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

Holdren also authored over 200 articles and papers and has co-authored and co-edited some 20 books and book-length reports including:&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whrc.org/about_us/whos_who/CV/jholdren.htm |title=John P.

This is a '''list of common misconceptions'''. Each entry is formatted as a correction, and contains a link to the article where the misconception is described. The misconceptions themselves are implied rather than stated.

==Arts and culture==

===Food and cooking===
[[File:fortune cookie broken 20040628 223252 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fortune cookie]]s, despite being associated with Chinese cuisine, were actually invented in Japan&lt;ref name="solving"/&gt; and are almost never eaten in China, where they are seen as American.&lt;ref name="snopesfortunecookie"/&gt;]]

* [[Searing]] meat may cause it to lose moisture in comparison to an equivalent piece of meat cooking without searing. Generally, the value in searing meat is that it creates a brown crust with a rich flavor via the [[Maillard reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookthink.com/reference/7/Does_searing_meat_really_seal_in_moisture|title=Does searing meat really seal in moisture?|publisher=Cookthink.com |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115343/http://www.cookthink.com/reference/7/Does_searing_meat_really_seal_in_moisture | archivedate = 2013-12-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite book|author=McGee, Harold|title=On Food and Cooking |edition=Revised|publisher=Scribner|date=2004|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|page=161}} "The Searing Question".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cooking with alcohol|Food containing wine or liquor]] retains alcohol even after cooking. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], 75% of the alcohol remains after [[flambé]]ing, 25% after one hour of baking or simmering, and 10% after two hours of baking or simmering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USDA Table of Nutrient Retention Factors, Release 6 (2007)|url=https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/usda-table-nutrient-retention-factors-release-6-2007 |website=National Agricultural Library |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of alcohol consumed while eating a dish prepared with alcohol will rarely if ever be sufficient to cause even low levels of intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weil|title=Does Alcohol Really Cook Out of Food|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400900/Does-Alcohol-Really-Cook-Out-of-Food.html|accessdate=August 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427083559/http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400900/Does-Alcohol-Really-Cook-Out-of-Food.html|archivedate=April 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Microwave ovens====
* [[Microwave ovens]] do not heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food. The functional principle of a microwave oven is [[dielectric heating]] rather than resonance frequencies of water, and microwave ovens can therefore operate at many frequencies. Water molecules are exposed to intense electromagnetic fields in strong non-resonant microwaves to create heat. The 22&amp;nbsp;GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths. The typical oven frequency of [[ISM band|2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz]] was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size, and partly to avoid interference with communication frequencies in use when microwave ovens became commercially available.&lt;ref name="microwave"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloomfield, Louis |url=http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |title=Question 1456 |publisher=How Everything Works |accessdate=February 9, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017005928/http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 | archivedate = 2013-10-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microwave ovens]] do not cook food from the inside out. 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods.

====Buddhism====
* The [[Gautama Buddha|historical Buddha]] was not obese. The "chubby Buddha" or "laughing Buddha" is a 10th-century Chinese folk hero by the name of [[Budai]]. In Chinese Buddhist culture, Budai came to be revered as an [[incarnation]] of [[Maitreya]], the [[Bodhisattva]] who will become a Buddha to restore Buddhism after the teachings of the historical Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]], have been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddha/a/laughingbuddha.htm|title=The Laughing Buddha|accessdate=January 6, 2011|publisher=about.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011304/http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddha/a/laughingbuddha.htm | archivedate = 2014-04-12| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Hebrew texts mention only ''tree'' and ''fruit''. Early Latin translations use the word ''mali'', which can be taken to mean both "evil" and "apple". In early Germanic languages the word "apple" and its cognates usually meant simply "fruit".

* The Bible does not say that exactly three [[Biblical Magi|magi]] came to visit the baby Jesus, nor that they were kings, or rode on camels, or that their names were Casper, Melchior, and Balthazar.

* The idea that [[Mary Magdalene]] was a prostitute before she met Jesus is not found in the Bible or in any of the other earliest Christian writings.

While most theologians state that [[canonization]]s meet the requisites,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Camillo Beccari, "Beatification and Canonization" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1907)]&lt;/ref&gt; aside from that, most recent popes have finished their reign without a single invocation of infallibility. Otherwise, even when speaking in his official capacity, dogma does not hold that he is free from error.

Nonetheless, the number of distinct words you can derive from them is not 50, or 150, or 1500, or a million, but simply unbounded. Only stamina sets a limit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The seven most common English words for snow are ''snow'', ''hail'', ''sleet'', ''ice'', ''icicle'', ''slush'', and ''snowflake''. English also has the related word ''glacier'' and the four common skiing terms ''pack'', ''powder'', ''crud'', and ''crust'', so one can say that at least 12 distinct words for snow exist in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Contrary to the popular image of the [[Pilgrim Fathers]], the early settlers of the [[Plymouth Colony]] in North America did not wear all black, and their [[capotain]]s (hats) were shorter and rounder than the widely depicted tall hat with a buckle on it. Instead, their fashion was based on that of the late [[Elizabethan era]]: [[doublet (clothing)|doublets]], [[jerkin (garment)|jerkins]] and [[ruff (clothing)|ruffs]].

Even Rousseau (or Maria-Theresa) did not use the exact words but actually ''Qu'ils mangent de la brioche'', "Let them eat [[brioche]]" (a rich type of bread).

* Human blood in [[veins]] is not actually blue. [[Hemoglobin]] give blood its red color. Deoxygenated blood has a deep red color, and oxygenated blood has a light cherry-red color. The misconception probably arises for two reasons: 1) Veins below the skin appear blue or green. This is due to a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood, including [[subsurface scattering]] of light through the skin, and human color perception. 2) Many diagrams use colors to show the difference between veins (usually shown in blue) and [[arteries]] (usually shown in red).&lt;ref name="blood"&gt;

* [[Shaving]] does not cause [[terminal hair]] to grow back thicker (more dense) or darker. This belief is due to hair which has never been cut having a tapered end, whereas after cutting the edge is blunt and therefore thicker than the tapered ends; the cut hair appears to be thicker and feels coarser due to the sharper, unworn edges. The shorter hairs being less flexible than longer hairs also contributes to this effect.&lt;ref name="shaving"&gt;

* "Blowing over a piece of paper does not demonstrate Bernoulli's equation. While it is true that a curved paper lifts when flow is applied on one side, this is not because air is moving at different speeds on the two sides... ''It is false to make a connection between the flow on the two sides of the paper using Bernoulli's equation.''" Holger Babinsky How Do Wings Work" Physics Education 38(6) http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/38/6/001/pdf/pe3_6_001.pdf
* "An explanation based on Bernoulli's principle is not applicable to this situation, because this principle has nothing to say about the interaction of air masses having different speeds... Also, while Bernoulli's principle allows us to compare fluid speeds and pressures along a single streamline and... along two different streamlines that originate under identical fluid conditions, using Bernoulli's principle to compare the air above and below the curved paper in Figure 1 is nonsensical; in this case, there aren't any streamlines at all below the paper!" Peter Eastwell ''Bernoulli? Perhaps, but What About Viscosity?'' The Science Education Review 6(1) 2007 http://www.scienceeducationreview.com/open_access/eastwell-bernoulli.pdf
* "The well-known demonstration of the phenomenon of lift by means of lifting a page cantilevered in one's hand by blowing horizontally along it is probably more a demonstration of the forces inherent in the Coanda effect than a demonstration of Bernoulli's law; for, here, an air jet issues from the mouth and attaches to a curved (and, in this case pliable) surface. The upper edge is a complicated vortex-laden mixing layer and the distant flow is quiescent, so that Bernoulli's law is hardly applicable." David Auerbach ''Why Aircreft Fly'' European Journal of Physics Vol 21 p 289 http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/21/4/302/pdf/0143-0807_21_4_302.pdf
* "Millions of children in science classes are being asked to blow over curved pieces of paper and observe that the paper "lifts"... They are then asked to believe that Bernoulli's theorem is responsible... Unfortunately, the "dynamic lift" involved...is not properly explained by Bernoulli's theorem." Norman F. Smith "Bernoulli and Newton in Fluid Mechanics" ''The Physics Teacher Nov 1972'' https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.2352317&lt;/ref&gt; The paper rises because the air follows the curve of the paper and a curved streamline will develop pressure differences perpendicular to the airflow.&lt;ref name="airflow"&gt;
* "...if a streamline is curved, there must be a pressure gradient across the streamline, with the pressure increasing in the direction away from the centre of curvature." Babinsky http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/38/6/001/pdf/pe3_6_001.pdf

* "The curved surface of the tongue creates unequal air pressure and a lifting action. ... Lift is caused by air moving over a curved surface." ''AERONAUTICS An Educator's Guide with Activities in Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education'' by NASA p. 26 http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/58152main_Aeronautics.Educator.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bernoulli's principle predicts that the decrease in pressure is associated with an increase in speed, i.e. that as the air passes over the paper it speeds up and moves faster than it was moving when it left the demonstrator's mouth. But this is not apparent from the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;'"Demonstrations" of Bernoulli's principle are often given as demonstrations of the physics of lift. They are truly demonstrations of lift, but certainly not of Bernoulli's principle.' David F Anderson &amp; Scott Eberhardt ''Understanding Flight'' p. 229 https://books.google.com/books?id=52Hfn7uEGSoC&amp;pg=PA229
* "As an example, take the misleading experiment most often used to "demonstrate" Bernoulli's principle. Hold a piece of paper so that it curves over your finger, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli."

* The [[Coriolis effect]] does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere. Rotation is determined by what ever minor rotation is initially present at the time the water starts to drain. The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances. The water has to be so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container and the externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) have to be very small.

* The idea that [[lightning]] never strikes the same place twice is one of the oldest and best known [[superstition]]s about lightning. There is no reason that lightning would not be able to strike the same place twice; if there is a thunderstorm in a given area, then objects and places which are more prominent or conductive (and therefore minimize distance) are more likely to be struck.

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right| The [[storming of the Bastille]], 14 July 1789, during the [[French Revolution]].]] 

This is a '''list of [[revolutions]] and [[rebellion]]s'''.
&lt;!-- It is not meant to include every instance of violent conflict. Do not add battles and wars which are unconnected to a revolution or rebellion. Do not add "revolutions" mandated from above. Do not add every riot and violent demonstration in the history of mankind, and do not accord recent events undue weight. Note: there is a section at the end, "Cultural, intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions", which does list some significant events, phenomenae or trends which are not violent rebellions or revolutions.  That may be split off later.--&gt;

'''Matrix''' is an open protocol for real-time communication.  It is designed to allow users with accounts at one [[communications service provider]] to communicate with users of a different service provider via [[online chat]], [[Voice over IP]], and [[Videotelephony]].  That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] email does now for [[store-and-forward]] email service.

From a technical perspective, it is an [[application layer]] [[communication protocol]] for [[Federation (information technology)|federated]] real-time communication.  It provides HTTP APIs and [[open source]] reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in [[JSON]] format over an open federation of servers.&lt;ref name=lwn&gt;{{cite news | url=https://lwn.net/Articles/632572/ | title=Matrix: a new specification for federated realtime chat | author=Nathan Willis | work=[[LWN.net]] | date=2015-02-11 | accessdate=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drdobbs&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/matrixorg-reloads-inside-illusion-of-con/240169004 | author=Adrian Bridgwater | title=Matrix.org Reloads Inside "Illusion of Control" Vortex | work=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]  | date=2014-09-09 | accessdate=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can integrate with standard [[web services]] via [[WebRTC]], facilitating browser-to-browser applications.

Other attempts at defining an open [[instant messaging]] or multimedia [[signalling protocol]] of this type had difficulties becoming widely adopted—e.g. [[XMPP]] and [[IRCv3]]—and have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240169575/solving-the-webrtc-interoperability-problem | author=Andrew Prokop | title=Solving the WebRTC Interoperability Problem - Post | work= No Jitter | date=2015-02-23 | accessdate=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear if there is enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telecomtv.com/articles/standards/to-interop-or-not-to-interop-is-matrix-org-the-answer-for-silo-d-comms-services-12444/ | author= Ian Scales| title=To interop or not to interop?

== History ==

=== Initial Project ===
The initial project was created inside [[Amdocs]], while building a chat tool called "Amdocs Unified Communications"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amdocs.com:80/Products/digital-lifestyle-services/Pages/unified-communications.aspx|title=Amdocs {{!}} Products {{!}} Unified Communications|last=|first=|date=|website=amdocs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003202858/http://www.amdocs.com:80/Products/digital-lifestyle-services/Pages/unified-communications.aspx|archive-date=2014-10-03|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape. Amdocs then funded most of the development work from 2014 - October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/who-is-matrix-org/|title=Who is Matrix.org? {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a [[subsidiary]] of Amdocs was created, named "Vector Creations Limited", and the Matrix Staff was moved there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/vector-creations-ltd.|title=Linkedin entry for Vector Creations Limited|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Matrix was the winner of the Innovation award at WebRTC 2014 Conference &amp; Expo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.uppersideconferences.com/award-winners-webrtc-2014-conference-expo/#.VZBLdbIVhBc|title=Award Winners of the WebRTC 2014 Conference &amp; Expo - Upperside Blog|date=2014-12-23|work=WebRTC|accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the "Best in Show" award at WebRTC World in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.webrtcworld.com/topics/from-the-experts/articles/403607-webrtc-world-miami-wrap-up-review.htm|title=WebRTC World Miami Wrap Up and Review|date=2015-05-18|work=WebRTC|accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding Crisis ===
In July 2017 the funding by Amdocs was announced to be cut and in the following weeks the core team created their own [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based company, "New Vector"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10873661 | title=Free company information from Companies House (UK Government) | accessdate=2018-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was mainly build to support Matrix and Riot development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vector.im/|title=New Vector - We believe the future will be open and decentralized|website=New Vector|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, there were multiple calls for support to the community and companies that build on Matrix&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/|title=A Call to Arms: Supporting Matrix! {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to help pay for the wages of at least part of the core team. [[Patreon]] and [[Liberapay]] crowdfunding accounts were created&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/hello-world-12867439|title=Hello world! {{!}} Matrix.org on Patreon|work=Patreon|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the core team started a [[Video Podcast|video podcast]], called Matrix "Live" to keep the contributors up to speed with ongoing developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Matrixdotorg|title=Matrix Live - Episode 1: July 14th 2017|date=2017-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0n1xz4KRVE|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was expanded by a weekly [[blog]] format, called "This Week in Matrix", where interested community members could read, or submit their own, Matrix-related news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/|title=This Week in Matrix {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== New Vector ===
The company was created with the goal of offering [[IT consultancy|consultancy]] services for Matrix and paid hosting of Matrix servers (as a platform called modular.im) to generate income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matrix-org | title=Matrix  | work=CrunchBase | accessdate=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.modular.im/|title=Awesome hosting for Matrix {{!}} Modular|website=www.modular.im|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early weeks after its creation, there the Matrix team and the company [[Purism, SPC|Purism]] published plans to collaborate in the creation of the [[Librem|Librem 5]] phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/purism-librem-5-january-2019,37216.html|title=Purism’s Privacy-Focused Librem 5 Smartphone's On Track For A Jan '19 Release|date=2018-06-06|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Librem 5 was intended to be a Matrix native phone, where the default pre-installed messaging and caller app should use Matrix for audio and video calls and instant messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5/|title=Librem 5 – A Security and Privacy Focused Phone – Purism|website=shop.puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late January 2018 the company received a investment of US$ 5 million from '''status&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/29/status-invests-5-million-in-matrix-to-create-a-blockchain-messaging-superpower/|title=Status invests $5 million in Matrix to create a blockchain messaging superpower|date=2018-01-29|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.status.im/status-invests-5m-in-riot-im-4e3026a8bd50|title=Status Invests $5M In Riot.im – Status Blog|date=2018-01-29|work=Status Blog|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;''', a  [[Ethereum]] based [[Startup company|startup]]. 

In April 2018 the [[Government of France|French Government]] announced plans to create their own instant messaging tool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-privacy/france-builds-whatsapp-rival-due-to-surveillance-risk-idUSKBN1HN258|title=France builds WhatsApp rival due to surveillance risk|last=Rosemain|first=Mathieu|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was later confirmed, by the Matrix team, to be based on Riot and Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/|title=Matrix and Riot confirmed as the basis for France’s Secure Instant Messenger app {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Vector is said to provide some support to the government in this endeavour.

=== The Matrix.org Foundation ===
In October 2018 a [[private company limited by guarantee]] called "the Matrix.org foundation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710|title=THE MATRIX.ORG FOUNDATION - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated, to serve as a neutral legal entity for further development of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/|title=Introducing the Matrix.org Foundation (Part 1 of 2) {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol==
Matrix targets use cases like [[Voice over IP]], [[Internet of Things]] and [[instant messaging]], including group communication, along with a longer-term goal to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web. The protocol supports security and replication, maintaining full conversation history, with no single points of control or failure.  Existing communication services can integrate with the Matrix ecosystem.&lt;ref name="lwn" /&gt;

Client software is available for open-federated Instant Messaging (IM), Voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT) communication.

The Matrix standard specifies [[REST]]ful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room’ on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room’. This data is signed using a git-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server’s private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows [[eventual consistency]] semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by re-synchronizing missing history from other participating servers.

The Olm library provides for optional [[end-to-end encryption]] on a room-by-room basis via a [[Double Ratchet Algorithm]] implementation.&lt;ref name="Ermoshina-2016"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Ermoshina |first1=Ksenia |last2=Musiani |first2=Francesca |last3=Halpin |first3=Harry|editor=Bagnoli, Franco et al. |pages=244–254 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45982-0_22|title=End-to-End Encrypted Messaging Protocols: An Overview|book-title=Internet Science |publisher=Springer |location=Florence, Italy |conference=INSCI 2016 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-45982-0_22 |isbn=978-3-319-45982-0 |date=September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can ensure that conversation [[data at rest]] is only readable by the room participants. With it configured, data transmitted over Matrix is only visible as [[ciphertext]] to the Matrix servers, and can be decrypted only by authorized participants in the room. The Olm and Megolm (an expansion of Olm to better suit the need for bigger rooms) libraries have been subject of a cryptographic review by [[NCC Group]], whose findings are publicly available&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review/|title=Matrix Olm Cryptographic Review |date=18 November 2016 |website=www.nccgroup.trust|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and have been addressed by the Matrix team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/|title=Matrix’s ‘Olm’ End-to-end Encryption security assessment released – and implemented cross-platform on Riot at last! {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was sponsored by the [[Open Technology Fund]].

== Bridges ==
Matrix does support bridging messages from different chat applications into Matrix rooms. These bridges are programs that run on the server and communicate with the non-Matrix servers. Bridges can either be acting as puppets or relays, where the in the former the individual users account is visibly posting the messages, and in the latter a bot posts the messages for non puppeteered user accounts. 

Currently there are bridges for:

* [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram|title=tulir/mautrix-telegram|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discord (software)|Discord]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord|title=Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter|title=matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But all are at various stages of completion.

== Clients ==
[[Riot.im|Riot]] is the reference implementation of a client. Many other clients, bots, bridges, servers and other implementations of the Matrix protocol exist too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Try Matrix Now!|url=https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html|website=Matrix.org|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are three classes of '''medical certifications for pilots'''; such certificates are required to legally exercise the privileges of a Pilot exercising the privileges of either a Private, Commercial or Airline Transport Pilot license.  Medical Certificates are not needed for Glider, Balloon, Recreational or Sport Pilot certifications.&lt;ref&gt;TITLE 14--Aeronautics and Space

CHAPTER I--FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

SUBCHAPTER D--AIRMEN

PART 61--CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND INSTRUCTORS&lt;/ref&gt;  Each certificate must be issued by a doctor approved by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to a person of stable physical and mental health.

==Types==
The three kinds are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c25ddaf911e70c5633e7cf502aef7794&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.17&amp;idno=14 |title=Federal Aviation Regulations 61.23(d)|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Pilot certification in the United States#Third class|Third Class]] Medical Certificate'':  necessary to exercise the privileges of a [[Private Pilot License|Private pilot license]] or [[Pilot certification in the United States#Private pilot|certificate]], or any lower pilot certification level except for the FAA's [[Pilot certification in the United States#Sport pilot|Sport pilot certificate]] (which only requires the same medical clearance required to drive a car, as evidenced by a valid driver license). In the United States, a third-class medical expires after 60 calendar months for someone under the age of forty years (as of the date of examination), or 24 calendar months for someone over forty.
*''[[Pilot certification in the United States#Second class|Second Class]] Medical Certificate'':  necessary to exercise the privileges of a [[Commercial Pilot License|Commercial pilot license]] or [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|certificate]]. In the United States, it expires after 12 calendar months regardless of pilot age.
*''[[Pilot certification in the United States#First class|First Class]] Medical Certificate'':  necessary to exercise the privileges of an [[Airline Transport Pilot License|airline transport pilot license]] or [[Pilot certification in the United States#Airline transport pilot|certificate]]. In the United States, it expires after 12 calendar months for a pilot under 40, 6 months for pilots over 40.

Medical certificates higher than the minimum requirement for a pilot license level still allow the holder to exercise the privileges at that level, even after the initial class of medical certification has expired. For instance, a pilot holding a valid first-class medical certificate may operate a plane with the privilege level of a private or commercial pilot. These privileges may be exercised until the date that a medical certificate of the minimum required class would expire; 9 months after issuance of a first-class medical, a pilot over 40 could still use the certificate to operate as a commercial or private/recreational pilot, and could still operate as a private or recreational pilot up to 2 years after issuance.

==Flight physicals==
Military and civilian pilots must pass routine periodic medical examinations known informally as "flight physicals" in order to retain the medical clearance or certification that qualifies them to fly.  Military pilots go to a [[flight surgeon]], an armed forces physician qualified to perform such medical evaluations.  With the exception of glider pilots, balloon pilots and sport pilots, civilian pilots in the United States and most other nations must obtain a flight physical from a civilian physician known as an [[Aviation Medical Examiner]] (AME).  AMEs are physicians designated and trained by the [[FAA]] to screen individuals for fitness to perform aviation duties.  Pilot medical assessment by way of the flight physical is an important [[public health]] function.

Flying has the potential for serious consequences if not done properly and carefully. Just as it would be unwise to fly in an aircraft that is not airworthy, it is unsafe to fly as, or with, a pilot who is medically compromised. Annual inspections are performed on all aircraft to assure that they meet minimum safety standards. Routine medical exams accomplish the same goal for pilots. When an aircraft successfully completes an annual inspection, the inspector endorses in the logbooks to signify the aircraft is airworthy. Similarly, when a pilot successfully passes the flight physical, the physician endorses the Airmen Medical Certificate which the pilot then carries when performing flight duties. This is then evidence that the pilot has met the medical standards for aircraft operation.

=== Types of flight physicals ===
{{outdated|date=November 2016}}
[[Federal Aviation Regulations]] in the U.S. require pilots and air traffic controllers to have periodic flight physicals in order to perform their aviation related duties.  Authority for these laws comes from the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) parts 61 and 67.  Federal regulations describe three classes of medical certificates: Class 3 medical certificates are for [[private pilot]] duties only. They have the least restrictive medical requirements and the certificates are good for 5 years for applicants under age 40 and 2 years for those 40 and over. Class 2 medical certificates are for commercial, non-airline duties as well as private pilot duties. This certificate would be required of crop dusters, charter pilots, corporate pilots, and anyone else who flies commercially. The certificate is good for 1 year for commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot use based on age. Class 1 medical certificates are required for airline transport pilots who fly scheduled airliners. These are the most complex examinations and include electrocardiograms (EKGs). EKGs are required at the first Class 1 medical after the applicant turns 35 and then the first medical after age 40 and yearly thereafter.  Class 1 certificates are good for airliner duties for 1 year for applicants under age 40 and 6 months for those 40 and over. Like the Class 2 certificate, however, these remain good for a full year for other commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot duties.  Detailed medical requirements for each class of pilot exam are described in [http://flightphysical.com/part67/index.htm Code of Federal Regulations Part 67].

A newer pilot classification in the United States does not require a formal flight physical.  A pilot can fly a light sport aircraft if they hold a sport pilot certificate or a recreational pilot certificate and have a U.S. driver' license from any state.  Pilots with neither a driver's license nor an Airmen Medical Certificate can still fly, but aviation duties are restricted to non-commercial activities in a glider or a balloon.  The pilot must self-endorse and certify that he/she has no known medical deficiencies which would render them incapable of piloting an aircraft. Sport pilot medical requirements are described in detail in [http://flightphysical.com/part67/61.303-Sport-Pilots.htm CFR 61.303].

== Denial of medical certification ==
Depending upon which Class certificate a pilot wants or needs, it is possible that either the [[Aviation Medical Examiner]] or the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] may deny a pilot's medical certificate. This may be due to recent surgery, medication taken, non-aviation-related offenses (such as drunk driving citations), or any other medical condition. Pilots may appeal denials up to and including formal appeals to the [[National Transportation Safety Board]]. The process of making an appeal includes meticulous documentation of a pilot's medical condition, therapies involved in treatment, and may be accompanied by psychological evaluations and/or other data. While any pilot may successfully make and receive approval via appeals, there are professional organizations that exist to aid pilots in appealing the denial of a medical certificate.

{{one source|date=June 2013}}
An '''open relationship''' is an [[intimate relationship]] which is consensually [[non-monogamous]]. This term may sometimes refer to [[polyamory]], but it is often used to signify a primary emotional and intimate relationship between two partners who agree to have sexual relationships but not romantic relationships with other people.  The nature of the openness in the relationship, including what outside sexual contact is permissible, varies widely.
Open relationships include any type of romantic relationship (dating, marriage, etc.) that is open.&lt;ref name="Collective2005"/&gt;  The concept of an open relationship has been recognized since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Web MD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doheny|first=Kathleen|title=The Truth About Open Marriage|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/the-truth-about-open-marriage|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of open relationships==
To a large degree, open relationships are a generalization of the concept of a relationship beyond monogamous relationships.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;  A form of open relationship is the [[open marriage]], in which the participants in a marriage have an open relationship.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

There are several different styles of open relationships. Some examples include:

* Multi-partner relationships, between three or more partners where a sexual relationship does not occur between all of the parties involved.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* Hybrid relationships, when one partner is nonmonogamous and the other is [[monogamous]].&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* [[#Swinging|Swinging]], in which singles or partners in a committed relationship engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity.

The term open relationship is sometimes used interchangeably with the closely related term [[polyamory]], but the two concepts are not identical. 
The main unifying element to open relationship styles is non-exclusivity of romantic or sexual relationships.

==Prevalence==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2012}}
Some believe that open relationships occur more frequently in certain demographics, such as the young rather than the old in America, including, more specifically, the college-educated middle-class, rather than the uneducated working-class, or people of certain ethnic and/or other racial minorities.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt; Open relationships may also be more common among females rather than males, especially those in the same categories, such as college-educated, middle-class, white, younger Americans.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt; This may be because women have more to gain by stressing this idea of equal rights, and that the women’s rights movement supports the idea of open relationships.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt;

A 1974 study showed that male students who either cohabit or live in a communal group are more likely to become involved in open relationships than females, and are still more interested in the concept than females even if not participating in open relationships.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt; A survey taken by gay men's "health and life magazine", ''FS Magazine'', 41% of [[gay men]] interviewed have been in an open relationship and of the men who have been in open relationships, 27% believe that it is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Nearly half of gay men have had an open relationship|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/02/03/nearly-half-of-gay-men-have-had-an-open-relationship/|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=[[PinkNews]]|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haggas|first1=Stuart|title=Open Relationships Uncovered|url=https://www.fsmag.org.uk/fs152-open-relationships-uncovered|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=FS Magazine|issue=152|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many couples within open relationships are dual-career, meaning that both primary partners have a stable job and/or a career. Both men and women in these, especially in closed groups, are also more likely to be in managerial jobs.  Most also are either [[childfree]], or post child-rearing.&lt;ref name="Ramey" /&gt;

==Reward vs. risk==
===Reasons for entering an open relationship===
&lt;!-- unless sourc(s) provided, this is a bunch of OR --&gt;
An open relationship may form for various reasons. These include:{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* liking another person but not wanting to end the old relationship
* being non-monogamous by nature (i.e. born that way)
* a difference emerging between two people in a relationship
* one partner realizing that they are unable to fulfill the other's needs&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* varying [[sex drive]] between partners&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* one or both partners desiring more freedom, companionship, intellectual variety, a variety of sexual partners&lt;ref name="Ramey1975" /&gt;, getting ahead career-wise or maintaining relationships
* a need for challenge: some people feel that their relationship is inadequate unless they are being challenged. Open relationships may create a sense of [[jealousy]], [[attachment theory|attachment]], or possessiveness, all of which are challenges for a relationship to work through.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; These emotions can also lead to greater [[self-awareness]] which may be seen as satisfying to those in open relationships.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* the enjoyment of [[new relationship energy]], the state of heightened emotional and sexual receptivity and excitement experienced during the formation of a new physical relationship&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* being able to meet other couples and individuals with a similar outlook with whom the participants can connect with on an intellectual and emotional level&lt;ref name="Ramey" /&gt;
* being in a relationship of convenience, that is, one that is not primarily based on mutual feeling of love towards each other (anymore), but rather on economic or social factors (eg: the traditional practice of [[polyandry]] in rural [[Tibet]])
* distance – when partners live in separate parts of the world for part or all of the time
* sex may be more pleasing, and the participants may engage in it more frequently than those in an average couple&lt;ref name="Ramey"/&gt;

===Reasons for avoiding an open relationship===
Many couples consider open relationships, but choose not to follow through with the idea.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} If a person attempts to approach their committed monogamous partner about transitioning to an open relationship, the monogamous partner may convince or coerce them to either stay monogamous or pursue a new partner.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; There may also be concern that when beginning an open relationship, a partner may become only concerned in their personal development and pay less attention to their partner.&lt;ref name="LinssenWik2010" /&gt;

Jealousy is often present in monogamous relationships, and adding one or more partners to the relationship may cause it to increase.&lt;ref name="LinssenWik2010" /&gt; Results of some studies have suggested that jealousy remains a problem in open relationships because the actual involvement of a third party is seen as a trigger.&lt;ref name="Buunk1981" /&gt; In Constantine &amp; Constantine (1971), the researchers found that 80% of participants in [[Open marriage jealousy|open marriages]] had experienced jealousy at one point or another.&lt;ref name="Buunk1981" /&gt;

Cultural pressure may also dissuade initiating or switching to an open relationship.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} There is a commonly held societal stereotype that those involved in open relationships are less committed or mature than those who are in monogamous relationships;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and films, media, and self-help books present the message that to desire more than one partner means not having a "true" relationship.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-WWII]] 1950s-1970s, it was traditional to "date around" (with guidelines such not going out with one particular suitor twice in a row) until ready to start "going steady" (the onset of exclusivity and sexual exploration); since then, non-exclusive dating around has lost favour and going directly to steady (now known simply as exclusive dating) has been elevated instead.&lt;ref name="Bailey1989" /&gt; Desiring an open relationship is these days{{which|date=April 2018}} often claimed to be a phase that a person is passing through before being ready to "settle down".&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; The logistics of an open relationship may be difficult to cope with, especially if the partners reside together, split finances, own property, or parent children.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

==== Sexually transmitted infection ====
{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}{{See also|safe sex|polyfidelity}}
Any sexual contact outside of a strictly [[monogamy|monogamous]] or [[polyfidelity|polyfidelitous]] relationship increases the possibility that one member of the group will contract a [[sexually transmitted infection]] and pass it into the group.

Neither [[Birth control#Barrier|barrier device]] use (such as [[condom]]s) nor more vigilant [[STI testing]] and vaccination can eliminate such risk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatcher|first1=Robert Anthony|last2=M.D|first2=Anita L. Nelson|title=Contraceptive Technology|date=2007|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=9781597080019|pages=297–311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=txh0LpjjhkoC&amp;pg=PA297|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918185600/https://books.google.com/books?id=txh0LpjjhkoC&amp;pg=PA297|archivedate=2017-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can reduce the statistical increase attributable to nonmonogamy.

==Successful open relationships==
One of the most significant factors that aids a relationship in being successful is that it is about making the relationship fit the needs of all parties involved. No two open relationships will be the same, and the relationship will change due to the current circumstances at each specific moment. The style of the open relationship will mirror the parties' involved values, goals, desires, needs and philosophies.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

The most successful relationships have been those that take longer to establish. By taking the time to develop a clear idea of what both partners want out of the openness of a relationship, it allows the parties involved to self-reflect, process their emotions, deal with possible conflicts, and (for those transitioning from monogamy to nonmonogamy) find ways to cope with the change.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

Negotiating the details of the open relationship is important throughout the communication process. Topics that are commonly found in negotiations between couples include honesty, the level of maintenance, trust, boundaries and time management.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

Other tools that couples utilize in the negotiation process include allowing partners to [[veto]] new relationships, prior permission, and interaction between partners. This helps to reassure each partner in the relationship that their opinion is important and matters. However, although ability to veto can be a useful tool in negotiation, a successful negotiation and open relationship can still occur without it. Some reject veto power because they believe it limits their partner from experiencing a new relationship and limits their freedom.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

===Boundaries===
Types of boundaries include physical, which is along the lines of not touching someone without permission being given; sexual boundaries; and emotional boundaries, which is avoiding the discussion of specific emotions.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; Boundaries help to set out rules for what is and is not acceptable to the members of the relationship. They also help people to feel safe and that they are just as important in the open relationship as their partners.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

Examples of boundaries that are set could include:&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* Who (geographically and interpersonally, such as in the community, friends, family, et cetera) could be an additional partner;
* What types of physical limits are placed on that relationship (kissing, dating, or other sexual activities);
* Whether sexual relations will take place in a separate bedroom, playroom or premises (eg hotel).

Some couples create a physical relationship contract. These can be useful in not only negotiating, but also clearly articulating the needs, wants, limits, expectations, and commitments that are expected of the parties involved.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

===Time management===
Adequate [[time management]] can contribute to the success of an open relationship. Even though having a serious commitment with one partner is common, negotiating the time spent among all partners is still important. Although the desire to give an unlimited amount of love, energy, and emotion to others is common, the limited amount of time in a day limits the actual time spent with each partner. Some find that if they cannot evenly distribute their time, they forego a partner.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; Time management can also be related to [[equity theory]], which stresses the importance of fairness in relationships.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

==Swinging==
{{main|Swinging (sexual practice)}}
Swinging is a form of open relationship in which the partners in a [[committed relationship]] engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with others at the same time. Swingers may regard the practice as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship. Swinging can take place in various contexts, including spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping at an informal social gathering of friends, a formal swinger party or partner-swapping party, and a regular gathering in a [[sex club]] (or swinger club) or residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polyamory==
{{main|Polyamory}}

Polyamory is the practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and [[consent]] of everyone involved. It is often described as consensual, ethical, or responsible nonmonogamy. The word is sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to sexual or romantic relationships that are not sexually exclusive, though there is disagreement on how broadly it applies; an emphasis on ethics, honesty, and transparency all around is widely regarded as the crucial defining characteristic.

While "open relationship" is sometimes used as a synonym for "polyamory" or "polyamorous relationship", the terms are not synonymous. The "open" in "open relationship" usually refers to the sexual aspect of a nonclosed relationship, whereas "polyamory" refers to the extension of a relationship by allowing bonds to form (which may be sexual or otherwise) as additional long-term relationships.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

The terms "polyamory" and "[[Casual dating|friends with benefits]]" are fairly recent, having come about within the past few decades&lt;ref name="LinssenWik2010" /&gt; though [[non-monogamy]] has existed since [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times.

A subset of polyamory is [[group marriage]] or [[polyfidelity]]. This type of relationship functions as an expanded marriage, where no member is sexually or romantically involved with anyone other than the group's members.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

Vol2 issue2.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2014 to 2016 the group claimed to have taken in over 10,470 individuals addicted to drugs (559 women and 9891 men) and cured over 7000 of them through the camps.&lt;ref name="KT" /&gt;

===Flogging===
The group have been known to flog drug users.&lt;ref name="seaglobe" /&gt;

===Poppy destruction===
The group conduct poppy field destruction activities in Kachin State,&lt;ref name="telg" /&gt; which has led to stand-offs with Burmese Security forces. Pat Jasan claimed to have cleared 2500 acres and 1500 of Poppies, in 2015 and 2016 respectively.&lt;ref name="KT" /&gt;

====Waingmaw standoff====
In early 2016, a standoff occurred between members of Pat Jasan who were planning to destroy poppies [[Waingmaw]], Burmese security forces and farmers. On January 20, Pat Jasan members  formally requested security from the Kachin State government for their planned eradication efforts and met with the state minister of border affairs. Following this, the group were given permission and a security force from local police.&lt;ref name="mmt3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/18603-police-to-protect-kachin-poppy-destroyers.html|title=Police to protect Kachin poppy destroyers|website=Mmtimes.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, 200 Pat Jasan members, 70 soldiers and 30 police travelled to the Sadaung-Kambaiti area of Waingmaw. On February 4, Pat Jasan members were attacked by around 250 locals.&lt;ref name="mmt7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/18835-kachin-poppy-eradicators-clash-with-growers.html|title=Kachin poppy eradicators clash with growers|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being informed that roughly 1000 armed farmers were waiting for them in the Sadaung-Kambaiti area of Waingmaw township, Pat Jasan called a temporary halt to their eradication effort, on grounds of safety.&lt;ref name="mmt1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/18670-kachin-poppy-destroyers-halted-by-armed-growers.html|title=Kachin poppy destroyers halted by armed growers|website=Mmtimes.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid February around 1200 Pat Jasan activists had camped at Naungmaw village, but as they tried to move to Kambaiti and Sadon on February 16 they were blocked by military and police&lt;ref name="mmt2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/19019-police-block-poppy-eradication-campaigners-in-kachin-state.html|title=Police block poppy eradication campaigners in Kachin State|website=Mmtimes.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for security reasons.&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35624824|title=Myanmar vigilantes in opium stand-off|date=21 February 2016|accessdate=5 December 2017|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 24, the numbers of Pat Jasan activists were around 2400 and they re-launched their campaign to eradicate poppies, with 200 members of the security forces including police, firemen and military troops protecting them.&lt;ref name="mmt6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/19138-vigilantes-authorities-agree-on-poppy-eradication-plan.html|title=Vigilantes, authorities agree on poppy eradication plan|website=Mmtimes.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mmt4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/nay-pyi-taw/19156-parliament-accepts-urgent-poppy-proposal.html|title=Parliament accepts urgent poppy proposal|website=Mmtimes.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The eradication campaign led to outbreaks of violence from armed farmers.&lt;ref name="mmt5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/19180-pat-ja-san-have-been-attacked-by-hand-grenade.html|title=Pat Ja San attacked by hand grenade|website=Mmtimes.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Science|expanded=phil/hist}}

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.

[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J. Fraser and K.G. Tobin (eds.), 2:1083–1092, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist epistemology|Feminist philosophers of science]], sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. In light of this dilemma, many folk—especially following Popper's "last-ditch" effort to "save" empiricism/positivism/realism with the falsifiability criterion—have agreed that positivism is a dead-end. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its doctrines were increasingly assaulted. Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= Objective reality exists beyond or outside our self. Any belief that it arises from a real world outside us is actually an assumption. It seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption. In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

The most obvious components of this comprehensive presupposition are that the physical world exists and that our sense perceptions are generally reliable."&lt;/ref&gt;
#''that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.''{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} Stanley Sobottka said, "The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish. For the most part, science is the discovering and explaining of the external world."{{sfn|Sobottka|2005|p=11}} "Science attempts to produce knowledge that is as universal and objective as possible within the realm of human understanding."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}}
# ''that Nature has uniformity of laws and most if not all things in nature must have at least a natural cause.''{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}}  Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] referred to these two closely related propositions as the [[Uniformitarianism|constancy of nature's laws]] and the operation of known processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=120}}, "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of known processes.  It works the other way around." You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the outcrop of rock."&lt;/ref&gt;  Simpson agrees that the axiom of uniformity of law, an unprovable postulate, is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate inductive inference into the unobservable past in order to meaningfully study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}, "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds.

===Coherentism===
{{main|Coherentism}}
[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

==Philosophy of particular sciences==
{{quote|''There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2629-5|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22there+is+only+science+whose+philosophical+baggage+is+taken+on+board%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22there%20is%20only%20science%20whose%20philosophical%20baggage%20is%20taken%20on%20board%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel Dennett|''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', 1995}}
In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of statistics===
{{Main|Philosophy of statistics}}
The problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the [[foundations of statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

===Philosophy of physics===
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G.

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Amartya Sen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for "combining tools from economics and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Prize in Econimic Sciences 1998 |website=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/press.html |date=1998-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pioneer plaques''' are a pair of [[gold]]-[[anodized]] [[aluminium]] [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] which were placed on board the 1972 ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and 1973 ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' [[spacecraft]], featuring a [[pictogram|pictorial message]], in case either ''Pioneer 10'' or ''11'' is intercepted by [[extraterrestrial life]].

The ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' spacecraft were the first human-built [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|objects to achieve escape velocity]] from the [[Solar System]]. The plaques were attached to the spacecraft's [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] support [[strut]]s in a position that would shield them from erosion by [[space dust|interstellar dust]].

==History==
The original idea, that the Pioneer spacecraft should carry a message from mankind, was first mentioned by [[Eric Burgess]]&lt;ref name="pournelle198204"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n213/mode/2up | title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited | work=BYTE | date=April 1982 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he visited the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], during the [[Mariner 9]] mission. He approached [[Carl Sagan]], who had lectured about communication with intelligent extraterrestrials at a conference in [[Crimea]].

Sagan was enthusiastic about the idea of sending a message with the Pioneer spacecraft. [[NASA]] agreed to the plan and gave him three weeks to prepare a message. Together with [[Frank Drake]] he designed the plaque, and the artwork was prepared by [[Linda Salzman Sagan]], who was Sagan's wife at the time.

Both plaques were manufactured at Precision Engravers, [[San Carlos, California]].

The first plaque was launched with ''Pioneer 10'' on March 2, 1972, and the second followed with ''Pioneer 11'' on April 5, 1973.

In May 2017 a limited edition of 200 replicas engraved from the original master design at Precision Engravers was made available in a [[Kickstarter]] Campaign, which also offered laser-engraved replicas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Duane|title=Pioneer Plaque: a Message from Earth|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/duaneking/pioneer-plaque-a-message-from-earth|website=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque hydrogen.svg|thumb|Hyperfine transition of neutral [[hydrogen]]]]
At the top left of the plate is a schematic representation of the [[hyperfine transition]] of [[hydrogen]], which is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element]] in the [[universe]]. The [[Hydrogen_line|spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom’s electron]] has a [[frequency]] of about 1420.405&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|MHz]], which corresponds to a [[Frequency#Period_versus_frequency|period]] of 0.704&amp;nbsp;[[Nanosecond|ns]]. Light at this frequency has a vacuum [[wavelength]] of 21.106&amp;nbsp;[[Centimetre|cm]] (which is also the distance the light travels in that time period). Below the symbol, the small vertical line&amp;mdash;representing the [[binary numeral system|binary]] digit 1&amp;mdash;specifies a unit of length (21&amp;nbsp;cm) as well as a unit of time (0.7&amp;nbsp;ns). Both units are used as measurements in the other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Jake|title=The Pioneer Plaque: Science as a Universal Language|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/0120-the-pioneer-plaque-science-as-a-universal-language.html|website=The Planetary Society|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Figures of a man and a woman===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque humans.svg|thumb|Figures of a [[man]] and a [[woman]]]]
On the right side of the plaque, a man and a woman are shown in front of the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/10/aliens-modern-messages-earths-equality-diversity-seti-yuri-milner|title=Send aliens modern messages of Earth's equality and diversity, say scientists|date=10 September 2015|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the brackets that indicate the height of the woman, the binary representation of the number 8 can be seen (1000, with a small defect in the first zero). In units of the wavelength of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen this means 8 × 21&amp;nbsp;cm = 168&amp;nbsp;cm.

The right hand of the man is raised as a sign of good will. Although this gesture may not be understood, it offers a way to show the [[opposable thumb]] and how the [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] can be moved.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

Originally Sagan intended the humans to be shown holding hands, but soon realized that an extraterrestrial might perceive them as a single creature rather than two organisms.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The original drawings of the figures were based on drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and Greek sculptures.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The woman's [[sex organ|genitals]] are not depicted in detail; only the ''[[Mons pubis]]'' is shown. It has been claimed that Sagan, having little time to complete the plaque, suspected that NASA would have rejected a more intricate drawing and therefore made a compromise just to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], ''"The art of looking sideways"'', Phaidon Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7148-3449-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Sagan said that the decision to not include the vertical line on the woman's genitalia ([[pudendal cleft]]) which would be caused by the intersection of the [[labia majora]] was due to two reasons. First, Greek sculptures of women do not include that line. Second, Carl Sagan believed that a design with such an explicit depiction of a woman's genitalia would be considered too obscene to be approved by NASA.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;Sagan, C. (2009).&lt;!--The PDF version was created in 2009.--&gt; &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan, Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective, Cambridge University Press&lt;/u&gt; pp. 22-25 {{ISBN|0-521-78303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the memoirs of [[Robert S. Kraemer]], however, the original design that was presented to NASA headquarters included a line which indicated the woman's [[vulva]],&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt; and this line was erased as a condition for approval of the design by John Naugle, former head of NASA's Office of Space Science and the agency's former chief scientist.&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;{{clear}}

===Relative position of the Sun to the center of the Galaxy and 14 pulsars===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque sun.svg|thumb|Relative position of the [[Sun]] to the center of the [[Galaxy]] and 14 [[pulsar]]s with their periods denoted]]
The radial pattern on the left of the plaque shows 15 lines emanating from the same [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Fourteen of the lines have corresponding long binary numbers, which stand for the [[Frequency|periods]] of [[pulsar]]s, using the hydrogen spin-flip transition frequency as the unit. Since these periods will change over time, the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] of the launch can be calculated from these values.

The lengths of the lines show the relative distances of the pulsars to the [[Sun]]. A tick mark at the end of each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the [[galactic plane]].

If the plaque is found, only some of the pulsars may be visible from the location of its discovery. Showing the location with as many as 14 pulsars provides redundancy so that the location of the origin can be [[triangulation|triangulated]] even if only some of the pulsars are recognized.

The data for one of the pulsars is misleading. When the plaque was designed, the frequency of pulsar "1240" (now known as J1243-6423) was known to only three significant decimal digits: 0.388 second.&lt;ref name=Sagan1972 /&gt; The map lists the period of this pulsar in binary to much greater precision: 100000110110010110001001111000. Rounding this off at about 10 significant bits (100000110100000000000000000000) would have provided a hint of this uncertainty. This pulsar is represented by the long line pointing down and to the right.

The fifteenth line on the plaque extends to the far right, behind the human figures. This line indicates the Sun's relative distance to the center of the galaxy.

The pulsar map and hydrogen atom diagram are shared in common with the [[Voyager Golden Record]].

===Solar System===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque solar system.svg|thumb|The [[Solar System]] with the trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft]]
At the bottom of the plaque is a schematic [[diagram]] of the Solar System. A small picture of the spacecraft is shown, and the [[trajectory]] shows its way past [[Jupiter]] and out of the Solar System. Both ''Pioneers 10'' and ''11'' have identical plaques; however, after launch, Pioneer 11 was redirected toward [[Saturn]] and from there it exited the Solar System. In this regard the ''Pioneer 11'' plaque is somewhat inaccurate.
The Saturn flyby of ''Pioneer 11'' would also greatly influence its future direction and destination as compared to ''Pioneer 10'', but this fact is not depicted in the plaques.

Saturn's rings could give a further hint to identifying the Solar System. [[Planetary ring|Rings]] around the planets Jupiter, [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] were unknown when the plaque was designed; however, unlike Saturn, the ring systems on these planets are not so easily visible and apparent as Saturn's. [[Pluto]] was considered to be a planet when the plaque was designed; in 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] reclassified Pluto as a [[dwarf planet]] and then in 2008 as a [[plutoid]]. Other large bodies classed as dwarf planets, such as [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], are not depicted, as they were unknown at the time the plaque was made.

The binary numbers above and below the [[planet]]s show the relative distance to the Sun. The unit is 1/10 of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit. Rather than the familiar "1" and "0", "I" and "-" are used.

===Silhouette of the spacecraft===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque spacecraft.svg|thumb|Silhouette of the Pioneer spacecraft relative to the size of the humans]]
Behind the figures of the human beings, the [[silhouette]] of the Pioneer spacecraft is shown in the same [[scale (spatial)|scale]] so that the size of the human beings can be deduced by measuring the spacecraft.

== Criticism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Voyager Golden Record]] --&gt;

One of the parts of the diagram that is among the easiest for humans to understand may be among the hardest for the extraterrestrial finders to understand: the [[Arrow_(symbol)|arrow]] showing the trajectory of Pioneer. An article in ''[[Scientific American]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich]] ‘The Visual Image’, 1972 in Scientific American (eds {{clarify|date=August 2013}}) ''Communication''. San Francisco, California, Freeman, pp. 46–60; originally in a special issue of Scientific American, September 1972; republished in Gombrich (1982) ''The Image and the Eye: Further Studies in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation'', London, Phaidon, pp. 137–61.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the use of an arrow because arrows are an artifact of hunter-gatherer societies like those on Earth; finders with a different cultural heritage may find the arrow symbol meaningless.

Art critic and activist [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] said that sexual bias is exhibited by the choice to make the man in the diagram perform the [[Wave (gesture)|wave]] gesture to greet the extraterrestrials while the woman in the diagram has her hands at her sides.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 176. Bogue (1991) is being used as a secondary source for this criticism from Owens (1983).--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogue, R. (1991). &lt;u&gt;Mimesis in Contemporary Theory: (vol. 2) Mimesis, semiosis, and power&lt;/u&gt;. USA: John Benjamins Publishing Company. pp. 176. {{ISBN|1-55619-150-2}} (hb.) (v. 2 : US)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists also took issue with this choice for the same reason.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach"&gt;Achenbach, J. (1999). &lt;u&gt;Captured by Aliens: The Search for Life and Truth in a Very Large Universe&lt;/u&gt; New York, NY: Citadel Press Books. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-8065-2496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Sagan regretted that the figures in the finished engraving failed to look panracial. Although this was the intent, the final figures appeared Caucasian.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach" /&gt; In the original drawing, the man was drawn with an "Afro" haircut, so an additional African physical trait would be included in the man to make the figures look more panracial, but that detail was changed to a "non-African Mediterranean-curly haircut" in the finished engraving.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 297.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gepper, A.C.T. (2012). &lt;u&gt;Imagining Outer Space: European Astroculture in the Twentieth Century&lt;/u&gt;. New York, NY: Smithsonian Institution. pp. 297. {{ISBN|978-0-230-23172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Carl Sagan said that Linda Sagan intended to portray both the man and woman as having brown hair, but the hair being only outlined rather than being both outlined and shaded made the hair appear blonde instead.&lt;!--This is at the top of page 74.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spangenburg, R. &amp; Moser, K. (2004). &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan: A Biography&lt;/u&gt; USA: Greenwood Press. pp. 74. {{ISBN|0-313-32265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people had different interpretations of the race of people depicted by the figures. Whites, blacks and Asians each tended to think that the figures resembled their own racial group, so, although some people were proud that their race appeared to have been selected to represent all of humankind, others viewed the figures as "terribly racist" for "the apparently blatant exclusion" of other races.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 82.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;

Linda Sagan decided to make the figures nude to address the problem of the type of clothes they should wear to represent all of humanity and to make the figures more anatomically educational for extraterrestrials,&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 79.--&gt; but their nudity was viewed as pornographic by the American media.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton"&gt;Wolverton, M. (2004). &lt;u&gt;The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes&lt;/u&gt; Joseph Henry Press. pp. 79, 80 &amp; 82. {{ISBN|0-309-53323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to astronomer Frank Drake, there were many negative reactions to the plaque because the human beings were displayed naked.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Carl Sagan]], ''Murmurs of Earth'', 1978, New York, {{ISBN|0-679-74444-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When images of the final design were published in American newspapers, one newspaper published the image with the man's genitalia removed and another newspaper published the image with both the man's genitalia and the woman's nipples removed.&lt;!--This is in the second and third paragraphs of page 23.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt; In one letter to a newspaper, a person angrily wrote that they felt that the nudity of the images made the images obscene.&lt;!--This is in the first paragraph of page 24.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt; In contrast, in another letter to the same newspaper, a person was critical of the [[Prude|prudishness]] of the people who found depictions of nudity to be obscene.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 24. The writer is being sarcastic in second and third paragraphs of page 24. Using sarcasm, the writer is mocking the prudishness which led to the censorship of the woman's vulva rather than supporting the censorship.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

;Star Trek
*In the ''Star Trek Encyclopedia'' paperback – International Edition, October 1, 1999, the plaque is shown with Pioneer launching from the second planet rather than the third. 
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', the plaque's diagram is fleetingly shown during Spock's mindmeld with V'ger, a transformed [[NASA]] space probe, ''Voyager 6''. This style of plaque was not used in the two actual NASA probes in the [[Voyager program]].
*In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the plaque appears on the viewing screen when a signal is sent by Rain Robinson trying to communicate with ''Voyager''. 16 minutes and 28 seconds into episode 8 season 3 Future's End.
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', the plaque is shown attached to a Pioneer probe floating in space—just before the probe is intercepted and destroyed by a bored [[Klingon]] ship captain, who scoffs "Shooting space garbage is no test of a warrior's mettle." However the plaque is erroneously depicted as facing outwards rather than inwards.
* In the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Federation'', a character mentions that humans had shown copies of the plaque to several alien races they encountered, but none had been able to decode it.

;Other
* In "[[The Message (The Outer Limits)|The Message]]," an episode of the science fiction series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', a deaf woman was featured receiving alien signals through her [[cochlear implant]], prompting her to write out Xs, 1s, and 0s on paper. When put together, the Xs turned into the images of the man and woman from the plaque, along with an extraterrestrial humanoid raising a hand in a peaceful gesture.
* On her album ''[[United States Live]]'', American performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]] contemplates extraterrestrials finding the plaque and asks "do you think that they will think his arm is permanently attached in this position?"
* In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Godfellas]]," the robot Bender finds himself doomed to drift through space, during which time he etches a modified version of the Pioneer plaque, with himself towering menacingly over the human figures, so that "When I'm found in a million years, people will know what the score was."
* In ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' season 1, episode 15 "Ardala Returns," Princess Ardala constructs a fake probe (allegedly launched in 1996) that utilizes a copy of the plaque in order to trick Buck into thinking the probe was from his own time period — the distant past.
* In the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', it is mentioned by the principal alien character that his race's conquest of Earth was made possible by their discovery of a space probe "that gave full directions to the place, had pictures of man on it and everything".
* In "[[Beware My Cheating Bart]]" (18th episode of Season 23) of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the plaque was briefly shown at the end of the episode. It was depicted with an extraterrestrial holding the plaque upside down, obviously confused by its strange depictions.
* The plaque is used as the artwork for the album ''Aufheben'' by [[the Brian Jonestown Massacre]] and for ''Accept the Signal'' by [[Regular Fries]].
* A drawing which bears a strong likeness to the one depicted in the plaque was used as the artwork for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[avant-garde metal]] band [[Arcturus (band)|Arcturus]]' album ''[[Sideshow Symphonies]]''.
* A character in ''[[Kamen Rider Gaim]]'' uses a package containing language dictionaries and a modified version of the plaque to later communicate with an other-dimensional sentient race.
* In the TV show ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', on episode 5 of season 2 (Duck Duck Goose), the plaque is shown as part of the debris that lands on Earth.
* In the TV show ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', on episode 21 of season 8 (The Communication Deterioration), the plaque is mentioned when they are discussing ideas about sending a message to alien races in space.
* In the video game by [[Paradox Development Studio]], ''[[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]]'', one of the scientific missions discovers the plaque on an alien world in the distant future.
* The Pioneer plaque appears in the booklet of [[David Bowie]]'s 2016 album ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'', on the page for the song "[[Girl Loves Me]]".
* The Pioneer plaque appears in 01 - Welcome / Orientation briefing video of the Mass Effect Andromeda Initiative website. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.masseffect.com/andromeda-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[17776]] has ''Pioneer 10'' (named Ten in the story) as a sentient being who is made fun of by ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (Nine) and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]]'' (JUICE) for being sent into space with a plaque displaying naked humans.
* In the [[Wii U]] title, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', the plaque is seen in the opening cut scene, damaged and floating in midspace, before one of the alien ships that later approaches Earth.
* [[Edwin_Morgan_(poet)|Edwin Morgan]]'s poem, "Translunar Space March 1972", refers to Pioneer 10, and passes critical commentary on the images on the plaque: "A deodorized American man / with apologetic genitals and no pubic hair / holds up a banana-like right hand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collected Poems |authors=Edwin Morgan |year=1997 |publisher=Carcanet Press |location=Manchester |isbn=978-1-857541-88-5 |pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2646">{{about|an auction on behalf of a government|auctions open to the public|Auction}}
A '''public auction''' is an [[auction]] held on behalf of a [[government]] in which the property to be auctioned is either property owned by the government, or property which is sold under the authority of a [[court of law]] or a government agency with similar authority.

When the term "[[government auctions|Government Auction]]" is used it generally means that specific auctioneers and agents are contracted to deal with stock that needs to be liquidated by various government bodies.

==Sale of property owned by the government==

Government property sold at public auction may include surplus government equipment, [[abandoned property]] over which the government has asserted ownership, property which has passed to the government by [[escheat]], [[government land]], and intangible assets over which the government asserts authority, such as [[Broadcasting|broadcast frequencies]] sold through a [[spectrum auction]].

Public auctions of government property may be conducted by whichever agency is auctioning the property. Some substantial items have been sold at public auction. For example, the [[United States Navy]] [[cruiser]] [[USS Philadelphia (C-4)|''Philadelphia'']] was sold at such an auction at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] in 1927.

==Sale of private property in a public auction==
Private property may be sold in a public auction for a number of reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process to satisfy a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a [[mortgage foreclosure]], [[tax lien]], or [[tax sale]]. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction to satisfy a judgment are distressed - that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell. In the [[United States]], public auctions to satisfy judgments are usually conducted under the authority of the [[sheriff]] of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a '''Sheriff's sale'''.

[[Real property]] may be subject to a public auction in order to [[Partition (law)|partition]] the property between [[Concurrent estate|joint tenants]] who can not agree as to how the property should be divided. An [[estate sale]] conducted at the direction of a [[probate court]] may also be conducted as a public auction.

'''Public duties''' are performed by military personnel, and usually have a ceremonial or historic significance rather than an overtly operational role.

==Denmark==
{{main|Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron}}
{{main|Royal Life Guards (Denmark)}}
[[File:Amalienborg.1.jpg|thumb|Royal Life Guards at Amalienborg Palace]]
There are two regiments in Denmark, who provide soldiers for public duties, the [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guard regiment]] and [[Guard Hussar Regiment (Denmark)|Guard Hussar Regiment]]. 

The [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron]] provide mounted escorts for the [[Monarchy of Denmark| Royal family]] and foreign dignitaries, and carry ceremonial services for the Royal Danish Army. 

The [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] provide a permanent guard at the Amalienborg Palace, Kastellet (part of the old fortification of Copenhagen), Rosenborg Castle/garrison of the Royal Life Guards in Copenhagen and the garrison of Høvelte. On occasions guard is kept at Fredensborg Palace, Marselisborg Palace, Gråsten Palace, Christiansborg Palace and other locations inside the Danish realm.
 
==Germany==
The ''Wachregiment Berlin'' was founded in early 1921. In addition to genuine security duties, the unit was used for ceremonial public duties in the capital. The regiment was disbanded in June 1921 and shortly after was revived as ''Kommando der Wachtruppe'' (lit. Headquarters Guard Troop). 

The ''Wachtruppe'' comprised seven companies, each drawn from one of the seven active army divisions. Each company served for three months before returning to its parent division. In this way, the Wachtruppe represented the whole [[Reichswehr]].

The ''Kommando'' was based at Moabit Barracks, and every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, performed a modest [[Guard Mounting|changing of the guard]] ceremony for the public. On each Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, the entire ''Wachtruppe'', accompanied by the regimental band, marched from the barracks through the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and to the Berlin War Memorial, providing a greater spectacle for public view.

In 1934, the unit was renamed ''Wachtruppe Berlin'' and in 1936, a headquarters and administration company were added. In June 1937, the unit was again renamed ''Wach Regiment Berlin''. Postings were now done by individuals, not entire companies, and each man served six-month tours of duty. The unit provided escorts and Guards of Honour for State Visits, Conferences and even the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].

In 1939, the unit was reorganized as the [[Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland]]. While equipped as a field unit, the regiment also maintained a public duties detachment in the capital. The ceremonial guard was pressed into service during the July bomb plot in 1944 and helped round up conspirators in the capital. 

In 1957, the post-war [[Bundeswehr]] established the [[Wachbataillon]], a tri-service unit, for ceremonial duties.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Queen's Guard}}
===London===
Three [[infantry]] [[battalions]] of the [[British army]] are currently tasked with the provision of Public Duties. Two of these are from the [[Foot Guards]] of the [[Household Division]], and one (since 1996) is a [[line infantry]] battalion. The former are normally based at [[Wellington Barracks, London|Wellington Barracks]] in central [[London]], within a short distance of [[Buckingham Palace]], and at [[Victoria Barracks, Windsor|Victoria Barracks]] in [[Windsor Castle]], while the latter is at the [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow]]. Permanent Public Duties [[Guards Incremental Companies|companies]] of the [[Foot Guards]] also supplement these men.

Apart from providing the [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[St James's Palace]], and the [[Tower of London]] Guard, the Public Duties battalions occasionally also provide the [[Windsor Castle]] Guard, which is otherwise provided by the battalion based at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. From 1783 to 1973, the Guards provided a nightly detachment called the [[Bank Picquet]] for guard duty at the [[Bank of England]].

===Edinburgh===
Public duties are also carried out in [[Edinburgh]], although not as frequently as in London. Prior to 2002, sentries were permanently stationed at the entrance to [[Edinburgh Castle]], but these were withdrawn due to cost-cutting measures. Today, sentries are posted during the evenings between 6 pm and 9 am, and throughout the week that HM The Queen spends in Edinburgh at both the castle and the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]. Sentries are also posted at the castle during the month of the [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo]] prior to each performance, with the regiment forming a [[guard of honour]] at the end of each performance.

Unlike in London, there is no permanently based foot guards battalion stationed in Edinburgh, so public duties are performed by one of the resident line infantry/rifles battalions. However, as part of the [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]] plan, the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Balaklava Company]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] will be reduced to a single incremental company to be based permanently in Scotland for public duties.

==Canada==
Public duties are performed in [[Ottawa]], the capital of [[Canada]]. The primary ceremonial duties involve mounting guard at the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] and at [[Rideau Hall]], the official residence of the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]. These are performed primarily by the two Canadian regiments of foot guards (the Governor General's Foot Guards/Ottawa, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards/Montreal), detachments of which are formed into the [[Ceremonial Guard]]. However, as in London, it is possible that any Canadian regiment could serve in this capacity on authority of the Chief of Defence Staff. The guard at Parliament Hill and Rideau Hall are mounted daily from early June until late August, with the first parade usually on the Friday before [[Canada Day]]. The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]], a Canadian Primary Reserve Unit, have often been called upon to perform additional public duties in Ottawa since their inception in 1872. Recently, the Ceremonial Guard has also been tasked to mount sentries on the Cenotaph, at Elgin and Wellington St.

==United States==
===Washington, D.C.===
Probably the best-known U.S. military unit to regularly engage in public duties is the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] ("The Old Guard") of the [[U.S. Army]]. Since April 6, 1948, the regiment is tasked with perpetually guarding the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The regiment also regularly takes part in [[White House]] ceremonies, including at [[state visit]]s.

The other U.S. military services have their own ceremonial units.

{{For|the Canadian holiday|Civic Holiday}}
A '''public holiday''', '''national holiday''' or '''legal holiday''' is a [[holiday]] generally established by law and is usually a non-working day during the year.

Sovereign nations and territories observe holidays based on events of significance to their history, such as the [[National Day]]. For example, [[Australians]] celebrate [[Australia Day]].

They vary by country and may vary by year. With [[Public holidays in Nepal|36 days a year]], Nepal is the country with the highest number of public holidays but it observes six working days a week. [[India]] ranks second with 21 national holidays, followed by [[Colombia]] and the [[Philippines]] at 18 each. Likewise, [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] enjoy 17 public breaks a year.&lt;ref name="nepalitimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jha|first1=Manish|title=Regular breaks|url=http://nepalitimes.com/regular-columns/Economic-Class/regular-breaks,788|website=[[Nepali Times]]|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries (e.g. Cambodia) with a longer, six-day workweek, have more holidays (28) to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Byrne|first1=Brendan|last2=Hor|first2=Kimsay|title=Can Cambodia stay competitive with so many public holidays?|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/can-cambodia-stay-competitive-so-many-public-holidays|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=[[The Phnom Penh Post]]|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public holidays are generally days of celebration, like the anniversary of a significant historical event, or can be a [[religious holiday|religious celebration]] like [[Diwali]]. Holidays can land on a specific day of the year, be tied to a certain day of the week in a certain month or follow other calendar systems like the [[Lunar Calendar]].

French ''[[Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées]]'' (''Day of solidarity with the elderly'') is a notable exception. This holiday became a mandatory working day although the French [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] confirmed it remains a holiday.

==Civic holiday==
A '''civic holiday''', '''civil holiday''' or '''work holiday''' is a day that is [[legal]]ly recognized and celebrated as a [[holiday]] in a particular [[sovereign state]] or [[jurisdiction]]al subdivision of such, e.g., a [[State (administrative division)|state]] or a [[province]].  It is usually a day that the [[legislature]], [[parliament]], [[congress]] or [[Monarch|sovereign]] has declared by [[statute]], [[edict]] or [[decree]] as a non-working day when the official arms of [[government]] such as the [[court|court system]] are closed.   In [[federation|federal states]] there may also be different holidays for the constituent states or provinces, as in the United States where holidays that were established by the federal government are called [[federal holiday|federal holidays]].  Such days may or may not be counted in calculating the [[statute of limitation]]s in legal actions and are usually days when [[child custody|non-custodial]] [[parents]] are given alternating visitation or [[Contact (law)|access]] to their children from a prior [[marriage]] or relationship according to a parenting schedule.

The term may also be used to distinguish between days that may be celebrated as secular holidays rather than religious holidays such as the celebration of New Year's Day on January 1 ([[Gregorian calendar]]) and January 14 ([[Julian Calendar]]) in certain [[eastern Orthodox]] Christian countries such as [[Russia]].

{{Sex and the law}}
'''Public morality''' refers to [[morality|moral and ethical standards]] enforced in a society, by law or police work or social pressure, and applied to public life, to the content of the [[Mass media|media]], and to conduct in [[public place]]s.  A famous remark of [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], that she did not care what people did as long as they "didn't frighten the horses" shows that in some sense even high [[Toleration|tolerance]] expects a ''public'' limitation on behaviour (sexual conduct is implied here). At the opposite extreme a [[theocracy]] may equate public morality with religious instruction, and give both the equal force of law.

Public morality often means [[sex and the law|regulation of sexual matters]], including [[prostitution]] and [[homosexuality]], but also matters of dress and [[nudity]], [[pornography]], acceptability in social terms of [[cohabitation]] before [[marriage]], and the protection of children. It is a main justification for [[censorship]]; it can lead to campaigns against [[profanity]], and so be at odds with [[freedom of speech]]. [[Gambling]] is generally controlled: [[casino]]s have been considered much more of a threat than large-scale [[lotteries]] or [[football pools]]. [[Public drunkenness]] is quite unacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons or to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has sometimes followed on similar reasoning. [[Abortion]] is sometimes treated as an aspect of public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical professionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. [[AIDS]] as a health policy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.

Views on public morality do change over time. For example, there have been proscriptions against eating in the street or allowing women to smoke in public.{{fact|date=December 2015}} These examples show that public views on which things which are acceptable often move towards wider tolerance. Rapid shifts the other way are often characterised by [[moral panic]]s, as in the shutting down of theatres a generation after [[Shakespeare]]'s death by the English [[Puritan]]s.

It may also be applied to the ''morals of public life''. [[Political corruption]], or the telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only individual politicians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or national level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations, though in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-raising. Whether the private lives of politicians are a public morals issue is not a matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an extramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be considered a revelation well within the sphere of the [[public interest]], while in other countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.

'''Public sphere pedagogy''' ('''PSP''') represents an approach to educational engagement that connects classroom activities with real world civic engagement.&lt;ref name="jill12"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0024-1822| volume = 97| issue = 2| pages = 40–45| last = Swiencicki| first = Jill|author2=Chris Fosen |author3=Sofie Burton |author4=Justin Gonder |author5=Thia Wolf | title = The Town Hall Meeting: Imagining a Self through Public-Sphere Pedagogy| journal = Liberal Education| accessdate = 2014-03-15| year = 2011| url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=64443756&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of PSP programs is to connect class assignments, content, and readings with contemporary public issues.&lt;ref name="ChicoPSP"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About Public Sphere Pedagogy - First-Year Experience | work = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2013 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/Public_Sphere_Work/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are then asked to participate with members of the community in various forms of [[public sphere]] discourse and [[democracy|democratic]] participation such as [[town hall meetings]] and public debate events.&lt;ref name="enjoymag"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Mosby| first = Claudia| title = The Great Debate and Civic Expo| work = Enjoy Magazine: Northern California Living| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-10-30| url = http://www.enjoymagazine.net/2013/10/30/the-great-debate-and-civic-expo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these events, students are challenged to practice [[civic engagement]] and [[civil discourse]].

__TOC__

==Theoretical foundations==

===Public sphere theory===
Public sphere pedagogy is theoretically grounded in [[Jürgen Habermas]]' conceptualization of the public sphere.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  In his seminal work ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'', Habermas envisioned the public sphere as an inclusive discursive space in which the citizens of a society gathered, discussed, and debated over the issues of the day.&lt;ref name="STPS"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262581086 | last = Habermas | first = J. | others = Thomas Burger, Frederick Lawewnce (trans.) | title = The structural transformation of the public sphere: An inquiry into a category of bourgeois society | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argued that the European bourgeois public sphere that emerged in eighteenth century coffee houses and salons represented an idealized form of the public sphere. Individuals engaging in discussion in these spaces would share and debate their views with one another. Habermas argues that this dialectic encounter was a critical part of one's social life where individuals, as part of a larger public, could construct [[public opinion]] through critical [[rational discourse]]. Habermas argued that these discussions served to fill the gap between the state and the people by creating what he called a "[[civil society]]". Further, Habermas argued that a functioning public sphere was critical to maintaining a healthy democratic order and [[deliberative democracy]].&lt;ref name="calhoun92"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262531143 | others = Craig Calhoun (ed.) | title = Habermas and the public sphere | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional notion of a face-to-face public sphere has evolved with the invention of online technologies. The public sphere no longer requires a physical setting, but can manifest in [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Habermas’ heritage: The future of the public sphere in the network society | last = Boeder | first = Pieter| journal = First Monday| accessdate = 2014-03-17| url = http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1280/1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee house discussions idealized by Habermas have expanded to blogs, discussion forums, and online videos. [[Henry Giroux]] in particular discusses the role of new media in the public sphere and public pedagogy.&lt;ref name="Biesta"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14649365.2012.723736| issn = 1464-9365| volume = 13| issue = 7| pages = 683–697| last = Biesta| first = Gert| title = Becoming public: public pedagogy, citizenship and the public sphere| journal = Social &amp; Cultural Geography| accessdate = 2014-03-19| date = 2012| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649365.2012.723736}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars debate whether [[computer-mediated communication]] in an online setting actually constitutes a functioning public sphere or just a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/14614440222226244| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 9–27| last = Papacharissi| first = Zizi| title = The virtual sphere: The internet as a public sphere| journal = New Media &amp; Society| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/1461444810379862| volume = 13| issue = 5| pages = 739–754| last = Goldberg| first = Greg| title = Rethinking the public/virtual sphere: The problem with participation| journal = New Media &amp; Society| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===The Town Hall Meeting===
Town Hall Meetings are one way public sphere pedagogy has been integrated into curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The CSU, Chico Town Hall Meeting - First-Year Experience - CSU, Chico | work = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2014 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/thm/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event began at [[California State University, Chico]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | conference = 2012 American Democracy Project and The Democracy Commitment National Meeting | last = Weber | first = Lori M. | title = Public Sphere Pedagogy: The Town Hall Meeting and the Chico Great Debate Programs, Assessing the Effect on Students' Civic Dispositions and Success | location = San Antonio, Texas | date = 2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes participating in the Town Hall event require students to research and write about controversial issues. Students then come together with classmates, students from other classes, faculty, and community members. During the Town Hall Meeting, participants move into breakout sessions to share their work and engage in discussions about their topics. Faculty and community members moderate these discussions, share expert insight, and move students toward further development of their work.

===The Great Debate===
The Great Debate also uses public sphere pedagogy as its foundation. This event started at California State University, Chico in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Chico Great Debate - First-Year Experience - CSU, Chico | format = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2014 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/greatdebate/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been implemented at [[Butte College]], [[Shasta College]],&lt;ref name="enjoymag" /&gt; and [[Chabot College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Chang| first = Nick| title = Hayward’s ‘Great Debate’ Brings Bilingual Education to Forefront| work = The Pioneer: California State University East Bay| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-12-12| url = http://thepioneeronline.com/19649/news/haywards-great-debate-brings-bilingual-education-to-forefront/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Debate requires students from a variety of classes to research and write about a controversial theme. These themes have ranged from water and agriculture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hacking| first = Heather| title = Students study, share at Chico's City Plaza in day-long Great Debate on ag and water| work = Chico Enterprise Record| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-04-13| url = http://www.chicoer.com/weirdnews/ci_23018351/students-study-share-at-chicos-city-plaza-day}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Cameron| first = Katerina| title = Great Debate Friday focuses on mental health| work = Chico Enterprise Record| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-10-31| url = http://www.chicoer.com/breakingnews/ci_24423914/great-debate-friday-focuses-mental-health}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is open to the public. Students give individual and group presentations, engage in formal debates, break out into discussion sessions, and display interactive poster presentations. Community members and public officials also participate as moderators, discussion leaders, and debaters. Unlike the Town Hall Meetings, which usually take place on campus property, the Great Debate is hosted in public spaces including City Council Chambers and public libraries.

===The Student Voices program===

Student Voices programs are a type of civic engagement initiative that have been implemented in several high schools in the United States. The curriculum has high school students research and complete classroom assignments on current issues in government and candidates in local elections.&lt;ref name="APPC"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Jamieson | first = Kathleen Hall | title = Student Voices | work = The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2008-05-07 | url = http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/political-communication/student-voices/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students then connect with outside communities via the digital public sphere and engage in moderated "Speak Out" events. Student Voices programs have been successfully implemented in curricula in Seattle&lt;ref name="ccca"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Center for Communication &amp; Civic Engagement :: Projects : Student Voices (2001-2006) | work = Center for Communication and Civic Engagement | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2005-05-17 | url = http://ccce.com.washington.edu/projects/studentVoices.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pennsylvania&lt;ref name="feldman07"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/520686 | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–100 | last = Feldman | first = Lauren |author2=Josh Pasek |author3=Daniel Romer |author4=Kathleen Hall Jamieson  | title = Identifying Best Practices in Civic Education: Lessons from the Student Voices Program | journal = American Journal of Education | date = 2007-11-01 | jstor = 10.1086/520692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; school districts.

==Critiques==
Public sphere pedagogy inherently is subject to many of the criticisms of Habermas' conception of the public sphere.  Chief among them is the traditionally exclusionary nature. The bourgeois public sphere, as introduced by Habermas, has been characterized as highly patriarchal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/466240 | issn = 0164-2472 | issue = 25/26 | pages = 56–80 | last = Fraser | first = Nancy | title = Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy | journal = Social Text | date = 1990 | jstor = 466240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and oblivious to the existence of female&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262531143 | pages = 259–288 | editors = Craig Calhoun (ed.) | last = Ryan | first = M. P. | title = Habermas and the public sphere | chapter = Gender and public access: Women's politics in nineteenth century America | location = Cambridge, MA | date = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and plebeian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 0816620318| last = Negt| first = Oskar|author2=Alexander Kluge | others = Peter Labanyi, Jamie Owen Daniel, Assebja Oksiloff (trans.)| title = Public sphere and experience: Toward an analysis of the bourgeois and proletarian public sphere| location = Minneapolis, MN| date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; styles of discourse. The concern here is that as a model of the bourgeois public sphere, applications of public sphere pedagogy might alienate students and community members unaccustomed to this type of dialectic experience.
In addition to its exclusionary nature, attention has also been called  to Habermas' privileging of a hegemonic public sphere. [[Michael Warner]] argues  that the bourgeois public sphere was structured to be affable to those privileged few who made up the powerful upperclass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Zone Books | isbn = 1890951285 | last = Warner | first = Michael | title = Publics and counterpublics | location = New York, NY | date = 2002-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While students participating in public sphere pedagogy application receive special training in their classrooms, the same is not necessarily true of community members who participate. This specialized student training draws two critiques. First, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction risks erasing the plurality that is central to being a public.&lt;ref name="Biesta"/&gt; Training individuals how to be "good" citizens prescribes action in a way that limits the scope of politics and the public sphere. Second, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of learning risks eclipsing politics with education.&lt;ref name="Biesta"/&gt; Turning political and social issues into learning problems individualizes the issues instead of making them the responsibility of the public.

A '''recording format ''' is a [[content format|format]] for [[encoder|encoding]] data for storage on a [[storage medium]]. The format can be container information such as [[Cylinder-head-sector|sectors]] on a disk, or user/audience information ([[Content (media and publishing)|content]]) such as [[analog signal|analog]] [[stereo]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]].  Multiple levels of encoding may be achieved in one format. For example, a text encoded page may contain [[HTML]] and [[XML]] encoding, combined in a [[plain text]] file format, using either [[EBCDIC]] or [[ASCII]] character encoding, on a [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] [[Digital data|digital]]ly formatted disk.  

In [[electronic media]], the primary format is the encoding that requires hardware to interpret (decode) data; while secondary encoding is interpreted by secondary [[signal processing]] methods, usually [[computer software]]. 

==Recording container formats==
A container format is a system for dividing physical storage space or virtual space for data. Data space can be divided evenly by a [[systems of measurement|system of measurement]], or divided unevenly with [[meta data]]. A grid may divide physical or virtual space with physical or virtual (dividers) borders, evenly or unevenly.  Just as a physical container (such as a [[file cabinet]]) is divided by physical borders (such as [[drawer (furniture)|drawer]]s and [[file folder]]s), data space is divided by virtual borders. Meta data such as a [[unit of measurement]], [[Address (geography)|address]], or [[meta tags]] act as virtual borders in a container format. A template may be considered an abstract format for containing a solution as well as the content itself.

==Raw content formats==
{{Main|content format}}

A raw content format is a system of converting data to displayable [[information]].  Raw content formats may either be recorded in secondary signal processing methods such as a software container format (e.g. [[digital audio]], [[digital video]]) or recorded in the primary format. A primary raw content format may be directly [[information processing|observable]] (e.g. [[image]], [[sound]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Odor|smell]], [[Haptic perception|sensation]]) or [[physics|physical]] data which only requires hardware to display it, such as a [[phonograph]]ic [[Gramophone needle|needle]] and [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] or a [[Image projector|projector]] [[List of light sources|lamp]] and [[magnifying glass]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">A '''sacrifice zone''' or '''sacrifice area''' (often termed a '''national sacrifice zone''' or '''national sacrifice area''') is a geographic area that has been permanently impaired by environmental damage or economic disinvestment.  These zones are most commonly found in low-income and minority communities.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Commentators including [[Chris Hedges]], [[Joe Sacco]], and [[Stephen Lerner]] have argued that corporate business practices contribute to producing sacrifice zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sacrifice Zones: The Front Lines of Toxic Chemical Exposure in the United States | pmc=3114843 | page=A266 | volume=119 | issue=6 | journal=Environ Health Perspect | doi=10.1289/ehp.119-a266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/07/chris-hedges-americas-sacrifice-zones-being-destroyed-for-profit/|title=Chris Hedges: America’s devastated ‘sacrifice zones’ are the future for all of us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/02/157813661/drive-for-profit-wreaks-days-of-destruction|title=Drive For Profit Wreaks 'Days Of Destruction'|date=2 August 2012|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==

The concept of sacrifice zones was first discussed during the [[Cold War]], as a likely result of [[nuclear fallout]].&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/09/23/steve-lerner-book-sacrifice-zones/|title=Think Globally, Act Locally: Steve Lerner, 'Sacrifice Zones,' at Politics and Prose|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=May 2017}} According to Helen Huntington Smith,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpwashingtonpost/docview/146405625/abstract/8E2861D9F233402DPQ/5|title=The Wringing of the West|last=Huntington Smith|first=Helena|date=1975-02-16|work=The Washington Post|location=Washington, DC|pages=–1-B4|issn=01908286|accessdate=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term was first used in discussing the long-term effects of strip-mining coal in the American West in the 1970s. The [[National Academy of Sciences]]/[[National Academy of Engineering]] Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface Mined for Coal in the Western United States produced a 1973 report that introduced the term, finding:&lt;blockquote&gt;In each zone the probability of rehabilitating an area depends upon the land use objectives, the characteristics of the site, the technology available, and the skill with which this technology is applied. At the extremes, if surface mined lands are declared national sacrifice areas, all ecological zones have a high probability of being successfully rehabilitated. If, however, complete restoration is the objective, rehabilitation in each zone has no probability of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rehabilitation potential of western coal lands|last=National Research Council (U S. ) Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface Mined for Coal in the Western United States|first=|date=1974|publisher=Ford Foundation Energy Policy Project / Ballinger Pub. Co.|year=|isbn=978-0-88410-331-8|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=85-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Similarly in 1975, Genevieve Atwood wrote in ''[[Scientific American]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Surface mining without reclamation removes the land ''forever'' from ''productive use''; such land can best be classified as a national sacrifice area. With successful reclamation, however, surface mining can become just one of a series of land ''uses'' that merely interrupt a current ''use'' and then return the land to an equivalent potential productivity or an even higher one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwood|first=Genevieve|date=1975-12-01|title=The Strip-Mining of Western Coal|url=https://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v233/n6/pdf/scientificamerican1275-23.pdf|journal=Scientific American|volume=233|issue=6|pages=23–29|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1275-23|issn=0036-8733|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Huntington Smith wrote in 1975, "The Panel that issued the cautious and scholarly National Academy of Sciences report unwitting touched off a verbal bombshell" with the phrase National Sacrifice Area; "The words exploded in the Western press overnight. Seized upon by a people who felt themselves being served up as 'national sacrifices,' they became a watchword and a rallying cry."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term sparked public debate, including among environmentalists and politicians such as future Colorado governor [[Richard Lamm]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lamm explained his view that Colorado must begin to control its own future, rather than succumbing to Washington's plea that the state should be “a national sacrifice area” to provide for the nation's energy needs." {{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/27/archives/an-ecofreak-for-governor.html|title=An eco‐freak for governor?|last=Griffith|first=Winthrop|date=1974-10-27|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/26/archives/worry-rises-that-rockies-face-pollution-and-crowds-no-exaggeration.html|title=Worry Rises That Rockies Face Pollution and Crowds|last=Sterba|first=James P.|date=1974-09-26|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3065">'''Sarah Page''' (26 August 1863 &amp;ndash; 20 January 1950), also known as '''Sarah Saunders Page''', was a New Zealand teacher, feminist, prohibitionist, socialist, social reformer, and politician.

[[File:Samuel Page 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Samuel Page, her husband, in 1907]]
Sarah Saunders was born in [[Waimea Plains, Tasman|Waimea South]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand in 1863. She was one of ten children of [[Alfred Saunders]], a radical politician, and grew up surrounded by [[Quakers]]. In 1896, she married Samuel Page, who was a science demonstrator at [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] and like herself a Quaker. They were to have two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page" /&gt;

With [[Ada Wells]], she was a dominating influence on the Canterbury Women's Institute. She was also active with the [[National Council of Women of New Zealand]] and was the organisation's secretary in 1905–06. She was an ardent critic of conscription and upset Prime Minister [[William Massey]] and the Minister of Internal Affairs, [[George Warren Russell]], with her criticism. Her son Robin was a conscientious objector and was imprisoned in 1918.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=General Items |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=BH19180128.2.21 |accessdate=5 December 2015 |work=Bruce Herald |volume=LIV |issue=7 |date=28 January 1918 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Labour Party developed into a strong party in the 1920s, Page's extreme left views became less accepted and her influence faded. She died in 1950 and is buried at [[Sydenham Cemetery]] next to her husband, who died in 1944.&lt;ref name="DNZB Page"&gt;{{DNZB|Bohan|Edmund|3p1|Sarah Page|December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social comparison theory''', initially proposed by [[social psychologist]] [[Leon Festinger]] in 1954,&lt;ref name="Festinger1954"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Festinger L | year = 1954 | title = A theory of social comparison processes | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 117–140 | doi=10.1177/001872675400700202}}&lt;/ref&gt; centers on the belief that there is a drive within individuals to gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self.

Following the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a way of self-enhancement,&lt;ref name="Gruder1971"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gruder C. L. | year = 1971 | title = Determinants of social comparison choices | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 473–489 | doi=10.1016/0022-1031(71)90010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills1981"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wills T. A. | year = 1981 | title = Downward comparison principles in social psychology | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 90 | issue = 2| pages = 245–271 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.2.245}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing the concepts of downward and upward comparisons and expanding the motivations of social comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Schachter, S. (1959). The psychology of affiliation: Experimental studies of the sources of gregariousness (Vol. 1). Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial framework ==
In the initial theory, Festinger provided nine main hypotheses. 
First, he stated that humans have a basic drive to evaluate their opinions and abilities and that people evaluate themselves through objective, nonsocial means (Hypothesis I).&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt;
Second, Festinger stated that if objective, nonsocial means were not available, that people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison to other people (Hypothesis II).&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; 
Next, he hypothesized that the tendency to compare oneself to another person decreases as the difference between their opinions and abilities becomes more divergent.&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; In other words, if someone is much different from you, you are less likely to compare yourself to that person (Hypothesis III). 
He next hypothesized that there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities, which is largely absent in opinions.&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; This drive refers to the value that is placed on doing better and better.&lt;ref name="Suls, J., Miller, R."&gt;Suls, J., Miller, R. (1977). "Social Comparison Processes: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives". Hemisphere Publishing Corp., Washington D.C. {{ISBN|0-470-99174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Hypothesis IV). 
Next, Festinger hypothesizes that there are non-social restraints that make it difficult or even impossible to change one's ability and these restraints are largely absent for opinions.&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; In other words, people can change their opinions when they want to but no matter how motivated individuals may be to improve their ability, there may be other elements that make this impossible&lt;ref name="Suls, J., Miller, R." /&gt; (Hypothesis V). 
Festinger goes on to hypothesize that the cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences (Hypothesis VI). 
Next, any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group from some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group. If discrepancies arise between the evaluator and comparison group there is a tendency to reduce the divergence by either attempting to persuade others, or changing their personal views to attain uniformity. However, the importance, relevance and attraction to a comparison group that affects the original motivation for comparison, mediates the pressures towards uniformity (Hypothesis VII). 
His next hypothesis states that if persons who are very divergent from one's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence, the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger (Hypothesis VIII). 
Lastly, Festinger hypothesized that when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group, the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than for those who are distant from the mode. Those close to the mode will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others, weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison, and even weaker tendencies to change their own opinions (Hypothesis IX).&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt;

== Theoretical advances ==
Since its inception, the initial framework has undergone several advances. Key among these are developments in understanding the motivations that underlie social comparisons, and the particular types of social comparisons that are made. Motives that are relevant to social comparison include self-enhancement,&lt;ref name="Gruder1971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills1981" /&gt; maintenance of a positive self-evaluation,&lt;ref name="Tesser1982"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tesser, A. |author2=Campbell, J.  | year = 1982 | title = Self-evaluation maintenance and the perception of friends and strangers. | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–279 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00750.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; components of attributions and validation,&lt;ref name="GoethalsDarley1977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goethals, G. R. |author2=Darley, J.  | year = 1977 | title = Social comparison theory: An attributional approach. | journal = Social Comparison Processes: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives | pages = 86–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the avoidance of closure.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Suls, J. |author2=Martin, R. |author3=Wheeler, L. | year = 2002 | title = Social comparison: Why, with whom, and with what effect?. | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 11| issue = 5 | pages = 159–163 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruglanski1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kruglanski, A. W. |author2=Mayseless, O.  | year = 1990 | title = Classic and current social comparison research: Expanding the perspective. | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.2.195|citeseerx=10.1.1.336.1436  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there have been changes in Festinger's original concept, many fundamental aspects remain, including the prevalence of the tendency towards social comparison and the general process that is social comparison.

=== Self-evaluation ===
According to Thorton and Arrowood, [[self-evaluation]] is one of the functions of social comparison. This is one process that underlies how an individual engages in social comparison.&lt;ref name="Thornton1966"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thorton, D. |author2=Arrowood, A. J.  | year = 1966 | title = Self-evaluation, self-enhancement, and the locus of social comparison. | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 2 |issue=2  | pages = 591–605 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(69)90049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual's specific goals will influence how they engage in social comparison. For self-evaluation, people tend to choose a comparison target that is similar to themselves.&lt;ref name="Wood1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wood, J. V. | year = 1989 | title = Theory and research concerning social comparisons of personal attributes. | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 231–248 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.2.231| citeseerx = 10.1.1.456.7776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they are most interested in choosing a target who shares some distinctive characteristic with themselves. Research suggests that most people believe that choosing a similar target helps ensure the accuracy of the self-evaluation.{{citation-needed|date=September 2018}} However, individuals do not always act as unbiased self-evaluators, and accurate self-evaluations may not be the primary goal of social comparison.

=== Self-enhancement ===
Individuals may also seek self-enhancement, or to improve their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Wood1989" /&gt; They may interpret, distort, or ignore the information gained by social comparison to see themselves more positively and further their self-enhancement goals. They will also choose to make upward (comparing themselves to someone better off) or downward (comparing themselves to someone worse off) comparisons, depending on which strategy will further their self-enhancement goals. They may also avoid making comparisons period, or avoid making certain types of comparisons. Specifically, when an individual believes that their ability in a specific area is low, they will avoid making upward social comparisons in that area. Unlike for self-evaluation goals, people engaging in social comparison with the goal of self-enhancement may not seek out a target that is similar to themselves. In fact, if a target's similarity is seen as a threat, due to the target outperforming the individual on some dimension, the individual may downplay the similarity of the target to themselves. This notion ties closely to the phenomena in psychology introduced also by Leon Festinger himself as it relates to the diminishing of cognitive dissonance. One does not want to perceive oneself in a way which would downplay one's original belief upon which one's self-esteem is based and therefore in order to reduce the cognitive dissonance, one is willing to change the cognitive representation of the other person whom one compares oneself to, such that one's own belief about oneself remains intact. This effectively leads to the comparison of apples to oranges or psychological denial.

Later advances in theory led to [[self-enhancement]] being one of the four [[self-evaluation motives]]:, along with ''[[self-assessment]]'', ''[[self-verification]]'', and ''[[self-improvement]]''.

===Upward and downward social comparisons===
Wills introduced the concept of downward comparison in 1981.&lt;ref name="Wills1981" /&gt; Downward social comparison is a defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation.  When a person looks to another individual or group that they consider to be worse off than themselves in order to feel better about their self or personal situation, they are making a downward social comparison. Research has suggested that social comparisons with others who are better off or superior, or upward comparisons, can lower self-regard,&lt;ref name="Tesser1988"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tesser, A. |author2=Millar, M. |author3=Moore, J.  | year = 1988 | title = Some affective consequences of social comparison and reflection processes: the pain and pleasure of being close. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–61 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.54.1.49 |pmid=3346807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas downward comparisons can elevate self-regard.&lt;ref name="Gibbons1986"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gibbons, F. X.| year = 1986 | title = Social comparison and depression: Company's effect on misery. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 140–148 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.140 | pmid = 3735064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparison theory emphasizes the positive effects of comparisons in increasing one's subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Wills1981" /&gt; For example, it has been found that breast cancer patients made the majority of comparisons with patients less fortunate than themselves.&lt;ref name="Woodetal1985"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wood, J. V. |author2=Taylor, S. E. |author3=Lichtman, R. R.  | year = 1985 | title = Social comparison in adjustment to breast cancer. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 1169–1183 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.49.5.1169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although social comparison research has suggested that upward comparisons can lower self-regard, Collins indicates that this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Collins1995"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins, R. L. | year = 1995 | title = For better or worse: The impact of upward social comparison on self-evaluations. | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–69 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals make upward comparisons, whether consciously or subconsciously, when they compare themselves with an individual or comparison group that they perceive as superior or better than themselves in order to improve their views of self or to create a more positive perception of their personal reality.  Upward social comparisons are made to self-evaluate and self-improve in the hopes that self-enhancement will also occur. In an upward social comparison, people want to believe themselves to be part of the elite or superior, and make comparisons highlighting the similarities between themselves and the comparison group, unlike a downward social comparison, where similarities between individuals or groups are disassociated.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002" /&gt;

It has also been suggested that upward comparisons may provide an inspiration to improve, and in one study it was found that while breast cancer patients made more downward comparisons, they showed a preference for information about more fortunate others.&lt;ref name="Taylor1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Taylor, S. E. |author2=Lobel, M.  | year = 1989 | title = Social comparison activity under threat: Downward evaluation and upward contacts. | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 569–575 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.569 | pmid=2678204|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.5713  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study indicated that people who were dieting often used upward social comparisons by posting pictures of thinner people on their refrigerators.&lt;ref name="Collins1995" /&gt; These pictures served as not only a reminder of an individuals current weight, but also as an inspiration of a goal to be reached. In simple terms, downward social comparisons are more likely to make us feel better about ourselves, while upward social comparisons are more likely to motivate us to achieve more or reach higher.

===Moderators of social comparison===
Aspinwall and Taylor looked at mood, self-esteem, and threat as moderators that drive individuals to choose to make upward or downward social comparisons.&lt;ref name="Aspinwall1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aspinwall, L. G. |author2=Taylor, S. E.  | year = 1993 | title = Effects of social comparison direction, threat, and self-esteem on affect, self-evaluation, and expected success. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 708–722 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparisons in cases where individuals had experienced a threat to their self-esteem produced more favorable self-evaluations.

====High self-esteem and social comparison====
Aspinwall and Taylor found that upward social comparisons were good in circumstances where the individuals making the comparisons had high self-esteem, because these types of comparisons provided them with more motivation and hope than downward social comparisons.&lt;ref name="Aspinwall1993" /&gt; However, if these individuals had experienced a recent threat or setback to their self-esteem, they reported that upward comparisons resulted in a more negative affect than downward comparisons.

====Low self-esteem and social comparison====
However, people with low self-esteem or people who are experiencing some sort of threat in their life (such as doing poorly in school, or suffering from an illness) tend to favor downward comparisons over upward comparisons. People with low self-esteem and negative affect improve their mood by making downward comparisons. Their mood does not improve as much as it would if they had high self-esteem. Even for people with low self-esteem, these downward social comparisons do improve their negative mood and allow them to feel hope and motivation for their future.

====Affect/mood and its effect on social comparison====
Individuals who have a negative mood improve their mood by making upward social comparisons, regardless of their level of self-esteem. In addition, both individuals with high self-esteem and low self-esteem who are in a positive mood elevate their mood further by making upward comparisons. However, for those who have recently experienced a threat to their self-esteem or a setback in their life, making upward social comparisons instead of downward social comparisons results in a more negative affect. Self-esteem and existence of a threat or setback in an individual's life are two moderators of their response to upward or downward comparisons.

=== Competitiveness ===
Because individuals are driven upwards in the case of abilities, social comparisons can drive competition among peers.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, P. &amp; Garcia, S. M. (manuscript) "Yin and Yang Theory of Competition: Social Comparison and Evaluation Apprehension Reciprocally Drive Competitive Motivation". [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/ChenGarciasubmitted.doc link].&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the psychological significance of a comparison depends on the social status of an individual, and the context in which their abilities are being evaluated.

==== Social status ====
Competitiveness resulting from social comparisons may be greater in relation to higher social status because individuals with more status have more to lose. In one study, students in a classroom were presented with a bonus point program where, based on chance, the grades for some students would increase and the grades for others would remain the same. Despite the fact that students could not lose by this program, higher-status individuals were more likely to object to the program, and more likely to report a perceived [[distributive justice|distributive injustice]]. It was suggested that this was a cognitive manifestation of an aversion to [[social mobility|downward mobility]], which has more psychological significance when an individual has more status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burleigh T.

==== Proximity to a standard ====
When individuals are evaluated where meaningful standards exist, such as in an academic classroom where students are ranked, then competitiveness increases as proximity to a standard of performance increases. When the only meaningful standard is the top, then high-ranking individuals are most competitive with their peers, and individuals at low and intermediate ranks are equally competitive. However, when both high and low rankings hold significance, then individuals at high and low ranks are equally competitive, and are both more competitive than individuals at intermediate ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Garcia S.

=== Models of social comparison ===
Several models have been introduced to social comparison, including the [[self-evaluation maintenance model]] (SEM),&lt;ref name="Tesser1988" /&gt; [[proxy model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler L. |author2=Martin R. |author3=Suls J. | year = 1997 | title = The proxy model of social comparison for self-assessment of ability | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 54–61 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_4|pmid=15647128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[triadic model]] and the [[three-selves model]].&lt;ref name="Blanton2001"&gt;Blanton, H. (2001). Evaluating the self in the context of another: The three-selves model of social comparison assimilation and contrast. In Cognitive social psychology: The Princeton symposium on the legacy and future of social cognition (pp. 75-87). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-evaluation maintenance model ====
The SEM model proposes that we make comparisons to maintain or enhance our self-evaluations, focusing on the antagonistic processes of comparison and reflection.&lt;ref name="Tesser1988" /&gt;
Abraham Tesser has conducted research on self-evaluation dynamics that has taken several forms. A self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) model of social behavior focuses on the consequences of another person's outstanding performance on one's own self-evaluation. It sketches out some conditions under which the other's good performance bolsters self-evaluation, i.e., "basking in reflected glory", and conditions under which it threatens self-evaluation through a comparison process.&lt;ref name="Tesser Website"&gt;Tesser, A., Social Psychology Network; http://tesser.socialpsychology.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proxy model ====
The proxy model anticipates the success of something that is unfamiliar.  The model proposes that if a person is successful or familiar with a task, then he or she would also be successful at a new similar task.  The proxy is evaluated based on ability and is concerned with the question "Can I do X?" A proxy's comparison is based previous attributes. The opinion of the comparer and whether the proxy exerted maximum effort on a preliminary task are variables influencing his or her opinion.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002" /&gt;

==== Triadic model ====
The Triadic Model builds on the attribution elements of social comparison, proposing that opinions of social comparison are best considered in terms of 3 different evaluative questions: preference assessment (i.e., "Do I like X?"), belief assessment (i.e., "Is X correct?"), and preference prediction (i.e., "Will I like X?"). In the Triadic Model the most meaningful comparisons are with a person who has already experienced a proxy and exhibits consistency in related attributes or past preferences.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002" /&gt;

==== Three-selves model ====
The three-selves model proposes that social comparison theory is a combination of two different theories. One theory is developed around motivation and the factors that influence the type of social comparison information people seek from their environment and the second is about self-evaluation and the factors that influence the effects of social comparisons on the judgments of self.&lt;ref name="Blanton2001" /&gt; While there has been much research in the area of comparison motives, there has been little in the area of comparative evaluation. Explaining that the self is conceived as interrelated conceptions accessible depending upon current judgment context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Markus H. |author2=Wurf E. | year = 1987 | title = The dynamic self-concept: A social psychological perspective | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 299–337 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.38.1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taking a cue from [[Social Cognitive Theory]], this model examines the [[Assimilation effect]] and distinguishes three classes of working [[Self-concept]] ideas: individual selves, possible selves and collective selves.

== Media influence ==
The media has been found to play a large role in social comparisons. Researchers examining the social effects of the media have used social comparison theory have found that in most cases women tend to engage in upward social comparisons with a target other, which results in more negative feelings about the self. The majority of women have a daily opportunity to make upward comparison by measuring themselves against some form of societal ideal. Social comparisons have become a relevant mechanism for learning about the appearance-related social expectations among peers and for evaluating the self in terms of those standards" (Jones, 2001, P. 647).

Although men do make upward comparisons, research finds that more women make upward comparisons and are comparing themselves with unrealistically high standards presented in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Strahan E. J. |author2=Wilson A. E. |author3=Cressman K. E. |author4=Buote V. M. | year = 2006 | title = Comparing to perfection: How cultural norms for appearance affect social comparisons and self-image | url = | journal = Body Image | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 211–227 | doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2006.07.004|pmid=18089224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As women are shown more mainstream media images of powerful, successful and thin women, they perceive the "ideal" to be the norm for societal views of attractive.  In recent years, social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have made this more widespread, since social media makes it easier to compare yourself to the "ideal". Some women have reported making upward comparisons in a positive manner for the purposes of self-motivation, but the majority of upward comparisons are made when the individual is feeling lesser and therefore evoke a negative connotation.

Self-perceived similarities with role models on social media can also affect self-esteem for both men and women. Having more self-perceived similarities with a role model can help increase self-esteem, while having less can decrease self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wohlford|first=Kathryn E.|last2=Lochman|first2=John E.|last3=Barry|first3=Tammy D.|date=2004-04-01|title=The Relation Between Chosen Role Models and the Self-Esteem of Men and Women|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=50|issue=7–8|pages=575–582|doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000023076.54504.ca|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;Social comparison with peers on social media can also lead to feelings of self-pity or satisfaction. The desire for social comparison can cause [[Fear of missing out|FoMO]] and compulsive checking of social media sites. 

== Criticisms ==
Many criticisms arose regarding Festinger's similarity hypothesis. Deutsch and Krauss&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M., &amp; Krauss, R. M. (1965). Theories in social psychology (Vol. 2). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that people actually seek out dissimilar others in their comparisons maintaining that this is important for providing valuable self-knowledge, as demonstrated in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goethals G. R. |author2=Nelson R. E. | year = 1973 | title = Similarity in the influence process: The belief-value distinction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 117–122 | doi=10.1037/h0034266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mettee, D. R., &amp; Smith, G. (1977). Social comparison and interpersonal attraction: The case for dissimilarity. Social comparison processes: Theoretical and empirical perspectives, 69, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiguity also circulated about the important dimensions for similarity. Goethals and Darley clarified the role of similarity suggesting that people prefer to compare those who are similar on related attributes such as opinions, characteristics or abilities to increase confidence for value judgments, however those dissimilar in related attributes are preferred when validating one's beliefs.&lt;ref name="GoethalsDarley1977" /&gt;

The '''social impact of thong underwear''' has been covered extensively in the media, ranging from a ban on wearing [[thong (clothing)|thong]]s to thongs for the underaged. The rise of thong usage has been asserted by Christian minister Oneil McQuick to be linked to a rise of [[sexualization]] in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Oneil|last=McQuick|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ewm93pO7YQcC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=thong+society+sex|title=The Sexuality Series|page=29|publisher=L.I.M Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1-4196-4225-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Christian writer Philo Thelos to be linked to a rise in a desire to go unclothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philo|last=Thelos|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KpYJYeKiss8C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=thong+society+sex|title=Divine Sex: Liberating Sex from Religious Tradition|page=52|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2003|isbn=1-55395-400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Thong (cropped).jpg|thumb|Woman wearing a T-back thong in [[Sunrise, Florida]], USA in 2006]] 

When discussing the trend of wearing thongs, Christian writer Sharon Daugherty comments in her book ''What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?'' that the fashion industry "may have changed the mindset of our society",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sharon|last=Daugherty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3kx5Z42GPYC||title=What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?|page=61|publisher=Destiny Image Publishers|year=2006|isbn=0-7684-2368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the observation that "the whole idea of wearing so that no panty line or bumps can show isn't substantiated" and that "the thong was created by fashion designers to arouse sexual thoughts".{{sfn|Daugherty|2006|page=63}}

[[Monica Lewinsky]] gave evidence during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] that she was flirting with [[Bill Clinton]] in [[Leon Panetta]]'s office, and that she lifted her jacket to show him the straps of her thong underwear above her pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Starr | first = Kenneth | author-link = Ken Starr | title = Report to the House on President Clinton: Narrative Pt.

In 2004, political commentator Cedric Muhammad wrote in essay ''The Thong versus the Veil'', "We wondered at the end of the day, of the two groups of women most prominently featured on American TV these days, who gains more respect for their intellect and spirit – the Afghan woman who is so totally veiled that you can't even see her eyes or the Black woman in the R&amp;B and Hip-Hop video who dances while wearing a bikini and thong?"&lt;ref&gt;Laura Flanders (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gg5NNztsUooC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=thong+culutre+sex&amp;lr=&amp;ei=DhgFSLXXPJTAzATBy_yXDg&amp;sig=QZNRmkA0_poI66Hywqj9tkkPYyg#PPA181,M1 The W Effect: Bush's War on Women], Page 181, Feminist Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-55861-471-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, Florida officials banned thongs from [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] and other public beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-01-05-spring-break-usat_x.htm|title=Alcohol-soaked spring break lures students abroad|newspaper=USA Today|author=Donna Leinwand|date=2003-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thongs for younger girls==
The 2000s saw a rise in the popularity of thongs among younger girls, who have been dubbed "thong feminists" by comedian [[Janeane Garofalo]]. The trend has been attributed to pop idols like [[Britney Spears]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2002 [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] released a line of thong underwear targeted for girls ages 10–16, though critics pointed out that children as young as seven could fit one of the thongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/05/22/news/companies/abercrombie/ |title=CNN Money |publisher=CNN  |date=28 May 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JS Online"&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=43941 JS Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114063620/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=43941 |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D9163BF937A15756C0A9649C8B63 |title=New York Times |work=New York Times |date=24 May 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for A&amp;F, Hampton Carney, stated that he could list "at least 100 reasons why a young girl would want thong underwear."&lt;ref name="JS Online"/&gt; This controversy spawned a great deal of free publicity for Abercrombie, including a chain letter that received wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/aandf.html |title=Break the Chain website |publisher=Breakthechain.org |date=6 June 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122041435/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/aandf.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; British retailer [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] produced child-size thongs and padded [[Brassiere|bras]] for girls as young as nine, eliciting a similar response from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=20 Feb 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/20/ngirls220.xml |title=(UK) |publisher=The Telegraph |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=This Is Money |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=363110&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;in_a_source=&amp;ito=1490 |title=(UK) |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=9 July 2001 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etam UK|Etam]], another British retailer, produced [[Sheer (textile)|sheer]] [[Top (clothing)|top]]s and thong underwear for girls of similar age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2003140951,00.html The Sun (UK)]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, photobooks and DVDs of underaged girls in T-back thongs has become popular as "T-back Junior Idols", which has come under scorn as a new form of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070503f1.html Photos of preteen girls in thongs now big business], Japan Times&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social innovations''' are new [[strategies]], [[concept]]s, [[idea]]s and organizations that aim to meet [[social]] needs resulting from [[working condition]]s, [[education]], [[community development]], and [[health]]. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening [[civil society]]. Social innovation includes the social ''processes'' of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the [[innovation]]s which have a [[social purpose]]—like [[activism]], [[online volunteering]], [[microcredit]], or [[Distance education|distance learning]].

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Domanski, Monge, Quitiaquez, Rocha|title=Innovación Social en Latinoamérica|date=2016|publisher=Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios|isbn=978-958-763-196-8|url=http://sfs.tu-dortmund.de/Publikationen/Innovacion_Social_en_Latinoamerica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired programs like the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign |first=Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html |title=Info Ladies bringing the internet by bike to the remote villages of Bangladesh &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html |title=Internet rolls into Bangladesh villages on a bike |publisher=Asafeworldforwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Info Ladies – Riding Internet into Rural Bangladesh! |publisher=Amader Kotha |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]]. 

==Focus and application==
Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or [[innovation]]. 

Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Klievink, B., &amp; Janssen, M. (2014). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10580530.2014.923268 "Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public-private governance"]  "Information Systems Management" 31:240–249&lt;/ref&gt; especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society.

The Young Foundation, in order to distinguish between social and business innovation, stressed that social innovation is developed and diffused via organisations, whose primary purposes are not centred on mere profit maximisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Innovation. What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated|last=Mulgan|first=Tucker|publisher=The Young Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of European Policy Advisers more precisely defined social innovation as socially oriented in both ends and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=). Empowering People, Driving Change: Social Innovation in the European Union|last=Hubert|first=A,|publisher=BEPA – Bureau of European Policy Advisers|year=2010|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these influential definitions, social innovation is characterised by: the capacity to address social needs that traditional policy seems increasingly unable to tackle; the empowerment of groups and individuals; and the willingness to change social relations. Hence, social innovation is often presented as a way to increase the quality of social services and their cost-effectiveness, offering equivalent, if not superior, outcomes despite considerable budget constraints.

Social innovation can take place within [[government]]; the for-profit sector, the [[nonprofit]] sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation.

[[Social entrepreneurship]], like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings "new patterns and possibilities for innovation" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"&gt;James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, &amp; Dale T. Miller "Rediscovering Social Innovation", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008.[http://innovationsociale.lu/sites/default/files/2008_Rediscovering%20Social%20Innovation_Phills%26al.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social innovation is often an effort of mental [[creativity]] which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan. Geoff. [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx "Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902021840/http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S. [http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/platforms_for_collaboration "Platforms for Collaboration"], Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.&lt;ref&gt;Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M.

Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to "a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (founder of the [[Open University]] and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Gavron, Dench e ds ''Young at 80'', Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as [[Pierre Rosanvallon]], [[Jacques Fournier]], and [[Jacques Attali]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_11 |title=Mumford, M.D. (2002) Social Innovation: Ten Cases from Benjamin Franklin, '&amp;#39;Creativity Research Journal'&amp;#39;, 14(2), 253-266 |publisher=Leaonline.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century [[reform]]ers like [[Robert Owen]], founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] focused attention on broader processes of [[social change]].  Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], for example, addressed the process of [[innovation]] directly with his theory of [[creative destruction]] and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;notably in the writings of [[Christopher Freeman]], Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Rediscovering Social Innovation" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include:
* '''Charter Schools:''' Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charter School." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community-Centered Planning:''' This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Emissions Trading:''' The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Fair Trade:''' Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting "environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Habitat Conservation Plans:''' Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Individual Development Accounts:''' This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''International Labor Standards:''' Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers’ rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity".&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Microfinance:''' This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Socially Responsible Investing:''' "An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection."&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Supported Employment:''' Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Over the last two decades social innovation has gained significant popularity as a strategy to tackle new social risks including population ageing and its health correlates (Hubert, 2010; Mulgan et al., 2007, 2010; Murray, Caulier-Grice and Mulgan, 2010). However, as other concepts recently developed within the academic debate – among them, [[social capital]] (Ferragina, 2012) – social innovation might soon turn out to be simply another way to juxtapose the qualifier "social" to the private sector jargon, in order to avoid heated discussions on structural inequalities (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"&gt;Grisolia, Francesco and Ferragina, Emanuele. (2015), "Social Innovation on the Rise: yet another buzzword in a time of austerity?" (Salute e società, Vol. 1(2015), pp. 169-179).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of ‘neoliberal austerity’, a strong call in favour of social innovation might hide the attempt to shift public attention from structural deficiencies and disparities to individual and group responsibility, following the vision: "doing more with less". In order to guarantee universal coverage and universal social rights, however, the welfare state system cannot be managed with the logic of mere cost-effectiveness alone (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; A Universal coverage is the precondition for any well-functioning economy, not the other way around. As such, the enhancement of "politically motivated policies under the pretence of budget cuts" can be particularly dangerous in its consequences for population health (Kleinert and Horton, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;1074). Social innovation per se might not be able to substantially tackle pressing social needs. Rather, the all-innovating and self-empowering jargon currently in vogue might disguise a dangerous inattention to structural inequalities, adversely affecting health outcomes across the board, but especially of the poorest. Among the therapies prescribed by the neoliberal orthodoxy – liberalisation, deregulation, devolution, individual or group empowerment – social innovation might soon reveal itself as a convenient buzzword, an eclectic concept to dissimulate political choices, legitimated by the doctrine of budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; The redistribution of resources "from past to present generations" – keeping constant the overall public spending – and the shift from a "transfer-based" to a "service-based" welfare state would represent a truly innovative approach to social policy, offering a credible and responsible alternative to the magic wand of social innovation.

== Developments since 2000 ==
Academic research, [[blogs]] and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include:

* '''Innovation in public services''' was pioneered particularly in some [[Scandinavia]]n and [[List of Asian countries|Asian countries]]. Governments are increasingly recognizing that innovation requires [[healthcare]], schooling and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp Innovation in the Public Sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110162352/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp |date=2006-11-10 }} an overview of thinking about innovation in the public sector, published by the UK government's Strategy Unit in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 Ready or Not?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070618163301/http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 |date=2007-06-18 }} published by The Young Foundation in 2007 about the need for public sector organizations to innovate&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social entrepreneurship]], which is the practice of creating new organizations focusing on non-market activities.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols; ''Social Entrepreneurship, Oxford University Press 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Responsible Research and Innovation]], which takes into account effects and potential impacts on the environment and society. It includes Engagement of all societal actors (researchers, industry, policymakers and civil society); Gender Equality; Science Education; Open Access; Ethics; and Governance.
* '''Online volunteering''', a free service launched in 2000 whereby individuals from all over the world contribute to the needs of development organizations and public institutions&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering service]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Open source''' innovation, in which the intellectual property involved in a product or service is made freely available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5544.html Innovation in open source] article by harvard business school about innovation in open source&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional support===
The US created an Office for Social Innovation in the White House, which is funding projects that combine public and private resources.&lt;ref name=economist810/&gt; with foundations that support social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, J. and Geoff Mulgan (2007) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/capital-ideas-july-2010 Capital Ideas. How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector]. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its '[[Social Innovation Fund]]', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, educational institutions are now increasingly supporting teaching and research in the area of social innovation. In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/socialenterprise/ |title=The Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School |publisher=Hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/skoll |title=The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, Said Business School, University of Oxford |publisher=Sbs.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INSEAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/centres/social_entrepreneurship/ |title=INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship Programme |publisher=Insead.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/professional-practice/mst-social-innovation/ Cambridge Judge Business School], University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-social-entrepreneurship/ |title=The Goldsmiths MA Programme in Social Entrepreneurship, University of London |publisher=Gold.ac.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; ''Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s innovation strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm |title=Home page - Innovation Union - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 The Open Book of Social Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044055/http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 |date=2010-10-08 }}. The Young Foundation and NESTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services.

The Common Ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacsi.org,au&lt;/ref&gt; were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' [[Geoff Mulgan]] and New York social entrepreneur [[Rosanne Haggerty]].

== Role in curbing corruption ==
Lin and Chen, in "The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are "socially valuable and good for many".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956953682|title=The impact of societal and social innovation : a case-based approach|last=Yeh-Yun,|first=Lin, Carol|others=Chen, Jeffrey,|isbn=9789811017667|location=Singapore|oclc=956953682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs.

=== Public participation, governmental action and the private sector against corruption ===

==== Grassroots involvement ====
"Corruption cannot be tackled from the top, it has to be confronted from the grassroots"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/corruption-confronted-grassroots-john-githongo-kenya|title='Corruption has to be confronted from the grassroots' {{!}} Madeleine Bunting|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|date=2011-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[John Githongo]], a Kenyan member of [[Transparency International]]. The Stanford Social Innovation Review develops that grassroots innovations emerge through a combination of social and ethical capital. That is especially true when the system in which they lie fails to accommodate to people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/tapping_the_entrepreneurial_potential_of_grassroots_innovation|title=Tapping the Entrepreneurial Potential of Grassroots Innovation (SSIR)|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against corruption, individuals or groups of citizens have used their position to lead battles against corruption. An example is the case of RosPil.net, a [[crowdsourcing]] website relying on anonymous tips and alerts to uncover and expose corruption in Russia,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2010/12/08/navalny-effect-rospil.net-pub-42105|title=The Navalny Effect: RosPil.net|last=Petrov|first=Nikolay|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether in the private or the public sector. The collective action permits a growing flow of information and offers, on a daily basis, around three promising tip-offs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example is the initiative Agenda Pública, a Civil Society [[Civil society organisation|Organisation]], which is paving way for transparent governance in Brazil by relying on the education of the country's public administrators,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/where-inequality-persists-social-entrepreneurs-can-step-in-to-bridge-the-gap/|title=Where inequality persists, social entrepreneurs can step in to bridge the gap|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in more remote and isolated rural areas. Agenda Pública trained more than 5,000 administrators in policy development and basic infrastructure, in order to promote effective parameters for transparency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They do so by making sure that environmental needs and basic financial, education and overall health are met to circumvent bribing.

===== Women and corruption =====
A [[UNDP]] study conducted amongst women grassroots organization around the world demonstrated that "79% of women are better able to stand up against corruption if affiliated with a community group".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Anti-corruption/Grassroots%20women%20and%20anti-corruption.pdf|title=Grassroots, Women and Anti-Corruption|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll suggested that electing women into power in countries heavily affected by corruption should be strongly accompanied by an affiliation to a mobilized grassroots women's group. Moreover, 83% of female respondents gave preferences to organized women's leadership to pursue anti-corruption policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Innovation lies mainly in the introduction of programmes facilitating access to information as well as a governance agenda designed to augment women's engagement in [[participatory monitoring]].

==== Private sector ====
Rich and Moberg in "Beyond Governments" claim that companies need to take the largest step against corruption and must engage in collective governance in order to include public policy and standards in their core business. It would be way to promote good practices, specifically socially responsible investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781351286077|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2006, the corporate sector fully funded and instigated the creation and development of the Business Code of Conduct for Combating Corruption in Malawi. It is considered an anti-corruption task force which works hand in hand with local groups, members of governments, civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/african-business-ending-corruption-%E2%80%98priority-number-one%E2%80%99|title=For African business, ending corruption is ‘priority number one’ {{!}} Africa Renewal Online|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental action ====
Anderson, Wu and Cho argue that good governance and its benefits can be extrapolated through effective e-governance. The simplification of administrative task and open data transparency, coupled with a clear policy on corruption can have a substantial impact.They also advocate for the strengthening of the delivery of services by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934513454|title=E-government strategy, ICT and innovation for citizen engagement|others=Anderson, Dennis (College teacher),, Wu, Robert (College teacher),, Cho, June-Suh, 1966-, Schroeder, Katja (Social media strategist),|isbn=9781493933501|location=New York, NY|oclc=934513454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the government introduced in 2016 the Open Government National Action Plan with one of the main aim being improved transparency. One of the main commitments is the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub. It is the use of social innovation to mobilize social actors and entrepreneurs against corruption. It is perceived that it will "catalyze and connect [an] innovation approach" while promoting the sharing of good practices.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18#commitment-4-anti-corruption-innovation-hub|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan of action has been supported by Switzerland, Indonesia, Spain, Georgia, Australia, the UAE, France and Norway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Kosovo, Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo (SAEK) has been developed in order to strengthen the capacities of the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). They are using innovative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], web2.0 and social media technologies as a way to connect the government and younger generations by utilizing the potential of new technologies as well as "giving citizens the opportunity to voice concerns, share observations online and to make these visible to the public while raising the awareness  on the level and form of corruption occurring in Kosovo".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undp.akvoapp.org/en/project/936/|title=Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAEK is considered a success as in the year it was launched, more than 1024 cases of corruption were reported (with half of them now resolved).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Information and communications technology as a tool for transparency ===
According to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development (part of the [[United Nations]]): "in addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/promoting-information-and-communication-technology-access-to-technology-for-all-and-social-innovation|title=Promoting information and communication technology, access to technology for all and social innovation {{!}} Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development|website=developmentfinance.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Open data and data mining ====
Open data is currently arising as a corruption-fighting mechanism. Indeed, as transparency in government data increases and becomes accessible to all, there will be opportunities for better accountability as it will increase the odds of uncovering governmental misconduct (specifically in government activities, budgets and expenditures for citizens). Its applications are various, including but not restricted to: following the money, open contracting, changing incentives and enabling cross-sector collaboration.

In 2015, one of the [[G20]] priorities was to reduce corruption and to promote good governance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf|title=G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles|last=G20|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) developed the Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles in order to leverage open data as one of the key actions to create and foster accountability and transparency. The principles are directly derived from the International Open Data Charter, which specifies the release and use of government data to reduce the reach of corruption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Transparency International]] and the Web Foundation carried out a study on certain member countries of the G20 (Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa) to evaluate the effect of the principles on their fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/open_data_and_the_fight_against_corruption_in_indonesia|title=TI Publication - Open data and the fight against corruption in Indonesia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, for example ([[Corruption in Indonesia]]), it is estimated that corruption has cost up to IDR 31,077 trillion to the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through public information availability, the country has tried to foster and promote its anti-corruption actions by utilizing its legal and institutional frameworks. Nonetheless, the access to datasets remains scarce while the lack of education amongst staff and citizens impedes the use of data as a tool against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Data mining]] was a crucial tool used in the famous anti-corruption investigation of the [[Panama Papers]] by way of the initiative of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/|title=The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data reached was 2.6 terabytes or 11.5 billion documents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The implementation of a [[graph database]] allowed for better efficiency in the research and analysis of the documents as it found hidden links between accounts and owners that would have been hard to dig up otherwise. Mar Cabra, ICIJ Data Editor, claimed that the software used made them feel like: "we [had] superpowers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neo4j|title=How the ICIJ Used Neo4j to Unravel the Panama Papers|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] is amongst the newest factors that has been shown by researchers to reduce the impact of corruption.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968551831|title=Political scandal, corruption, and legitimacy in the age of social media|others=Çakır-Demirhan, Derya,, Demirhan, Kamil,|isbn=9781522520191|location=Hershey, Pennsylvania|oclc=968551831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media platforms have created a multi-way communication which contradicts the one-way channel of traditional media. It enables individuals to share experiences in a quick and cheap manner through its platforms. It facilitates exchanges of geographically separated individuals which makes it an important tool as a dialogue platform.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In many countries, cases of human rights violations and corruption have started to come out publicly. They challenge the status quo of the government holding the monopoly over information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The World Economic Forum established in 2014 that social media could be a useful tool to drive anti-corruption because of its ability to advance commentary and information provision to the population.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/12/how-to-use-social-media-to-fight-corruption/|title=How to use social media to fight corruption|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful because of its key role in investigating through collective action participation. They use the example of I Paid A Bribe, an Indian website inviting users to input their daily contact with corruption and whether they paid a bribe or not to a public servant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mobile banking ====
[[Petty corruption]] can be fought by the emergence of cashless payments, and more generally in a cashless economy.

In Kenya, [[M-Pesa]] was launched to allow people to transfer money through mobile phones.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile success story turns 10|last=CNN|first=Kieron Monks,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by almost two-thirds of the population and is gaining momentum as it is opening its technology to other countries (Tanzania for example).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As traffic police is seen as one of the most notorious sources of corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000189201/i-saw-traffic-officers-extort-bribes-president-tells-top-police-bosses|title=I saw traffic officers extort bribes, President tells top police bosses|last=Reporter|first=Standard|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa proposed to create cashless payments on public buses to avoid the extortion of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28106004|title=Kenya's buses to go cashless|date=2014-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are currently some logistical and regulatory problems preventing it from getting traction, [[mobile banking]] is seen as a potential tool to fight petty corruption, specifically if it is accompanied by the proper framework for legislative action and [[good governance]].
==Local and regional development==
Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/[[Regional development|regional]] development covers innovation in the [[social economy]], i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining [[social relations]], especially [[governance]] relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and [[Frank Moulaert]] researched social innovation.&lt;ref name="Laville, J 1994"&gt;Laville, J.-L. (Ed.) (1994) L’économie solidaire, une perspective internationale, Desclée de Brouwer, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;eissn=1360-0591&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=289 |title=Moulaert, F. and Sekia, F.

Another, larger project was SINGOCOM&lt;ref name="users.skynet.be"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/bk368453/singocom/index2.html Social Innovation, Governance, and Community Building] (2002–2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[European Commission]] [[FP5|Framework 5]] project, which pioneered so-called "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS&lt;ref name="KATARSIS Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katarsis.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=KATARSIS Homepage |publisher=Katarsis.ncl.ac.uk |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SOCIAL POLIS.&lt;ref name="Social Polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialpolis.eu/ |title=Social Polis |publisher=Socialpolis.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="MacCallum, D. 2009"&gt;MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S. Vicari (Eds) (2009) ''Social Innovation and Territorial Development''.

The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies.  The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) [http://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/03_socialinn-web.pdf Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Innovation Europe&lt;ref name="Socialinnovationeurope.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialinnovationeurope.eu |title=Home &amp;#124; Social Innovation Europe |publisher=Socialinnovationeurope.eu |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states.

The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them – identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom – be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business – they can be most effectively scaled-up.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45743">'''Societal collapse''' is the fall of a complex human [[society]]. Such a disintegration may be relatively abrupt, as in the case of [[Classic Maya collapse|Maya civilization]], or gradual, as in the case of the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. 

The subject of societal collapse is of interest in such fields as [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and, more recently,  [[complex systems|complex-systems]] science.

== Causes of collapse ==
Common factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical, environmental, social and cultural, and disruptions in one domain sometimes cascade into others.  In some cases a natural disaster (e.g. [[tsunami]], [[earthquake]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[resource depletion]] might be the proximate cause of collapse.  Significant inequity may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures.  [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through deforestation, loss of soil fertility, restrictions of trade and/or rising endemic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared "Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign invasions===
The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the events traditionally marking the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Barbarian invasions]], although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]]). This view of the collapse of the Roman Empire is challenged, however, by modern historians who see Rome as merely transforming from the Western Empire into barbarian kingdoms as the Western Emperors delegated themselves out of existence, and the East transforming into the [[Byzantine Empire]], which only fell in 1453 AD.

[[North Africa]]'s populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Bedouin]] tribes of [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=461 The Great Mosque of Tlemcen], MuslimHeritage.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S. Russell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brutal pillaging that followed [[Mongol invasions]], the invaders decimated the populations of China, Russia, the Middle East, and [[Islam in Central Asia|Islamic Central Asia]]. Later Mongol leaders, such as [[Timur]], though he himself became a Muslim, destroyed many cities, slaughtered thousands of people and did irreparable damage to the ancient irrigation systems of [[Mesopotamia]]. These invasions transformed a settled society to a [[nomad]]ic one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html Ibn Battuta's Trip: Part Three - Persia and Iraq (1326 - 1327)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] of extraordinary virulence. [[Smallpox]] ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|Native American population]] of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox – and other Deadly Eurasian Germs]&lt;/ref&gt; although new research suggests tuberculosis from seals and sea lions played a significant part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=Kirsten I.|last2=Harkins|first2=Kelly M.|last3=Herbig|first3=Alexander|last4=Coscolla|first4=Mireia|last5=Weber|first5=Nico|last6=Comas|first6=Iñaki|last7=Forrest|first7=Stephen A.|last8=Bryant|first8=Josephine M.|last9=Harris|first9=Simon R.|date=2014-10-23|title=Pre-Columbian mycobacterial genomes reveal seals as a source of New World human tuberculosis|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7523/full/nature13591.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=514|issue=7523|pages=494–497|doi=10.1038/nature13591|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4550673|pmid=25141181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live smallpox was also included in the ship inventories of the Australian first settlement, and a smallpox epidemic spread across the continent 3 years after European settlement.

Societal collapse of many indigenous cultures has occurred as a result of European [[imperialism]] in various parts of the globe, particularly in areas where European settler communities took possession of land once held by native peoples, in Latin America and North America, and in [[Australasia]].  The effects of this dispossession are still evident in many of the problems confronting indigenous cultures, including [[alcoholism]], high rates of [[incarceration]], [[suicide]] rates and fraternal violence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Sub-replacement fertility ===

The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Polybius]], writing in [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], largely blamed the decline of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]] on low fertility rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polybius,  Histories, book 37, Depopulation of Greece|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.01.0234%253Abook%253D37%253Achapter%253D9|website = www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{blockquote| In our time all Greece was visited by a dearth of children and generally a decay of population, owing to which the cities were denuded of inhabitants, and a failure of productiveness resulted, though there were no long-continued wars or serious pestilences among us….

==Changes occurring with collapse==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
There are three main types of collapse:

'''Reversion/Simplification''': A society's [[adaptive capacity]] may be reduced by either a rapid change in population or societal complexity, destabilizing its institutions and causing massive shifts in population and other social dynamics.  In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology.  These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]].  Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].

'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure.  This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song Dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.

'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.

Other changes that may accompany a collapse:

* '''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian.
* '''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of job specialization. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.
* '''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.
* '''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.
* '''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]].  In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, such as happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]], or a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands.  In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]].  A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5 million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but in the [[Early Middle Ages]] the population had declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.

==Population dynamics==
In the general study of [[cultural change]] and [[population dynamics]], a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes.  Organizational [[adaptability]] relates importantly to organizational diversity.

Several key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm Population crises and cycles in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405081151/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm |date=2011-04-05 }}, A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W M S Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
The coupled breakdown of economic, cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse. In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse]  TED talk, Feb 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Tainter]] theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tainter|first1=Joseph A.|authorlink=Joseph Tainter|date=1990|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|edition=1st paperback|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It matches closely [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] idea that "they find problems they can't solve".

===Linking social and environmental dynamics===
Modern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay, and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources. However, many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure, so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another—leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause.

What produces modern sedentary life, unlike [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness, both because of a society's dependence on it, and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[Self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]] as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.

As a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's [[diminishing returns]] are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, where the population grows without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.

For the modern world economy, for example, the growing conflict between food and fuel, depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources, is visible in recent major [[commodity price shocks]].  It is one of the key relationships researchers, since the early studies of the [[Club of Rome]], have been most concerned with.

[[Jared Diamond]] pursues these themes in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

===Population pressure and mineral resource exhaustion===
[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:
* According to his ecological view of [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary [[Heat death of the universe|'heat death']] of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy on Earth.
* According to his social theory of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)|'bioeconomics']], humanity's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will nothing but increase.
Taken together, the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]] with regard to the [[Peak minerals|Earth's mineral stock]]. The [[world economy]] will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself.

Georgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]]. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168–171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546–549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–145}} &lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;

=== Theories of energy return on energy invested ===
A related economic model is proposed by Thomas Homer-Dixon&lt;ref&gt;Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), "The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization" (Knopf, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Charles Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Charles 2009 "What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have" ENERGIES [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction, or energy return on energy invested ([[EROEI]]).  This measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.

There would be no surplus if EROEI approaches 1:1. What Hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that, estimated to be 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. Part of the mental equation is that the EROEI of our generally preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves.  An EROEI of more than ~3, then, is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on.

The EROEI figure also affects the number of people needed for sustainable food production. In the pre-modern world, it was often the case that 80% of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100%, with a low energy budget. In modern times, the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high EROEI enabled 100% of the population to be fed with only 4% of the population employed in agriculture. Diminishing EROEI making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy, and so increases the number of people employed in food production again.

===Models of societal response===
According to [[Joseph Tainter]]&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1990), ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press) pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; (1990), too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse:

# The '''Dinosaur''', a large-scale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate and yet nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources' reduced availability:  In this type of society, rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action.  They will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.
# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]):  This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (''e.g.'', pillage or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely.  The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.
#:Tainter argues that [[capitalism]] can be seen as an example of the Runaway Train model, in that [[generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practices]] require publicly traded companies, along with many privately held ones, to exhibit growth as measured at some fixed interval (often [[Fiscal year#United States|three months]]).  Moreover, the ethos of [[consumerism]] on the demand side and the practice of [[planned obsolescence]] on the supply side encourage the purchase of an ever-increasing number of goods and services even when resource extraction and food production are unsustainable if continued at current levels.
# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse.  This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern bloc]] and other [[Communism|communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).
#:By contrast, as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] [[Democracy in America|observed]], when voluntary and private associations are allowed to flourish and gain legitimacy at an institutional level, they complement and often even supplant governmental functions:  They provide a "safety valve" for dissent, assist with resource allocation, provide for social experimentation without the need for governmental coercion, and enable the public to maintain confidence in society as a whole, even during periods of governmental weakness.

====Tainter's critique====
Tainter argues that these models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other.

[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]], a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s]]

For example, the failure of [[Easter Island]]'s leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above.  The islanders, who erected large statues called ''[[moai]]'' as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors, used felled trees as rollers to transport them.  Because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity, they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify ''moai'' production.  Because Easter Island's geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate ("House of Cards"), deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting.  Competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties (an additional "Runaway Train" iteration).  Together these events led to the collapse of the civilization, but no single factor above provides an adequate account.

Mainstream interpretations of the history of Easter Island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors (see [[Easter Island History#Destruction of society and population]].) Again, no single point explains the collapse; only a complex and integrated view can do so.

Tainter's position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms.  In his own words (p.&amp;nbsp;194):

# human societies are problem-solving organizations;
# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.

With these facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.

===Toynbee’s theory of decay===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his 12-volume [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1961), theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. ([[Carroll Quigley]] would expand on and refine this theory in his "The Evolution of Civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo The Evolution of Civilizations]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Toynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment, over the human environment, or attacks from outside. Rather, societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones.

The fixation on the old methods of the "Creative Minority" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a "[[dominant minority]]" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), failing to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their "former self", by which they become prideful, and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face.

He argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:

{{quote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession.  Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration.  The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}

He argues that, as civilizations decay, they form an "Internal Proletariat" and an "External Proletariat." The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a "schism in the body social", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship by the creative minority.

He argues that in this environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a Prophet).  He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died.

Toynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].

The great irony expressed by these and others like them is that civilizations that seem ideally designed to creatively solve problems, find themselves doing so self-destructively. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Systems science===
Researchers, as yet, have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies, which is an important scientific problem.  Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist.  However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience&lt;/ref&gt; using [[systems thinking]] for careful storytelling about systemic organization and change.

History includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation.  The abrupt [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the course of a few months, without any external attack, according to [[Johan Galtung]] was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach, which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems.

Although a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a culture's social and economic life, societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture.  [[Russian culture]] would seem to have outlived both the society of [[Imperial Russia]] and the society of the [[Soviet Union]], for example. Frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a 'classic' period of centralized social order, perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens.  Societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society, who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites. For example, the [[Black Death|black plague]] contributed to breaking the hold of [[Europe]]an [[feudal society]] on its [[underclass]] in the 15th century.

'''Tower music''' is a musical performance from the top of a tower. It can also designate the music composed for or played in such a performance.

In the early European Middle Ages, musical instruments on towers were used to warn of danger and mark the passage of time. At first this was done by a tower watchman, later by [[alta capella|ensembles of instrumentalists employed by the city]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Turmmusik Die Turmmusik], Duden dictionary entry, Bibliographisches Institut GmbH&lt;/ref&gt; The music became more choral, and came to by played on specific days of the week, and to mark specific dates (feast days such as Christmas and Easter, for instance). The practice largely died out in the late 19th century, but was revived in the early twentieth, and continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Gerlinde Haid: [http://www.musiklexikon.ac.at/ml/musik_T/Turmblasen.xml Turmblasen]. In: Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon. Online-Ausgabe, Wien 2002 ff., {{ISBN|3-7001-3077-5}}; Druckausgabe: Band 5, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 2006, {{ISBN|3-7001-3067-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern tower music is often played by volunteers. 

The tower used would often be a church tower, but the tower or balcony of a civic building might also be used. &lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Schnabel: ''Die evangelische Posaunenchorarbeit. Herkunft und Auftrag.'' Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1993, S. 174 f. ([https://books.google.de/books?id=7b0u8N6YLXIC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Turmmusik&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=Turmblasen&amp;f=false online] auf Google Bücher)&lt;/ref&gt;

The instruments had to be audible to someone not on the tower. This eliminated the quieter (''basse'') instruments, leaving the louder [[alta capella|(''haut'') instruments]]. Apart from bells, [[natural trumpets]], [[slide trumpet]]s, [[trombones]], [[shawms]], [[bagpipes]], and [[drum]]s were used.

Music was written specifically to be played from towers, but other works could also be used. [[Alta capella]] musicians playing the tower music would generally also perform in processions and ground-level outdoor events, and in some cases would also perform (on different instruments) indoors.

==History==
Many English cities in the 1500s had town [[alta capella|waits]], as did rich individuals and institutions. In 1571, London ordered its waits to play “upon their instruments upon the turret at the Royal Exchange every Sunday and holiday toward the evening.” (with winter break, between September to late March, excepted). These may have been London’s first regularly scheduled public concerts. London's waits also played from its walls. &lt;ref name=kimball_16&gt;[http://kimballtrombone.com/trombone-history-timeline/trombone-history-16th-century/ Timeline of trombone history], Will Kimball&lt;/ref&gt;

These civic wind bands of town pipers had been a feature of larger German towns and cities since well before the beginning of the sixteenth century, similar to the employment of [[wait (musician)|wait]]s with their [[sackbuts]] and [[shawm]]s in England.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=28}} [[Martin Luther]], one of the chief figures of the [[Reformation]], encouraged music-making in the service of God, and by around 1570 town councils were employing musicians specifically to take part in church services to supplement the organ playing.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=27}} 

One of the most popular forms of outdoors public music-making in the 17th century in Germany and central Europe was [[tower music]] (German: ''Turmmusik''), organised by the town piper (''Stadtpfeifer'') or tower master (''Turmmeister''). He and his band of musicians, also called ''Stadtpfeifer'' (the German plural is the same as the singular) played music for loud and penetrating wind or brass instruments from church towers and town hall balconies.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=28}}&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, Achim (1992).

Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1992, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The term 'tower master' seems to have been applied to various jobs. One was as the musical director of town or city music, such as Glöggl in Linz, and e.g. the theatre director Franz Pokorny (1797-1850) in [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pokorny, Franz (1797-1850), Theaterdirektor |url=http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_P/Pokorny_Franz_1797_1850.xml |publisher=Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon (ÖBL) online |series=1815-1950, Bd. 8 (Lfg. 37) |year=1980 |p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bohuslav Martinu]]'s father, a [[sexton (office)|sexton]] and town watchman lived in the church tower in [[Polička]] as the ''turmmeister'', but in e.g. [[Cologne]] they seem to have been a type of civic constable or magistrate with arresting powers c1530&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lDSuvJtjrBcC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222 ''The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Early Modern Germany''] by Bridget Heal p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; or one competent to examine midwives c1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/upress/online/frei/978-3-89958-944-3.volltext.frei.pdf ''Rheinische Hebammengeschichte im Kontext''] ed.

Generations of the [[Bach family]] in [[Erfurt]] filled the office of Stadtpfeifer or ''Ratsmusiker'' (German: 'town council musician'). By 1600 [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]], [[Dresden]], [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]], [[Stettin]], [[Nordhausen]] and even [[Eisenach]] ([[J. S.

In [[Nuremberg]] and [[Leipzig]] and there was a particular penchant for antiphonal tower music: three verses of a hymn would be echoed back and forth three times between the bands stationed in the towers of the [[St. Matthew, Leipzig|Neukirche]], [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig|St. Thomas Church]] and [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig]].{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=29}} The Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and tower master ('Turmmeister') of St. Nicholas Church from 1669 was [[Johann Pezel]] (or Petzold, etc.) whose ''Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium'' ('Leipzig 10 o'clock music') was published the following year,&lt;ref&gt;Petzel, Johann (1670).

Another Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and virtuoso trumpet player Gottfried Reiche (1667-1734){{sfn|Collins|2000|p=59}} described tower music in his preface to ''Vier und zwanzig Neue Quatricinia'' (1696) for cornett and three trombones, as "a sign of joy and peace", an embodiment of the  spiritual-cultural life of the city "certainly whenever the whole country is in mourning, or in war, or when other misfortune is to be lamented."{{efn|"Und so, wie Gottfried Reiche im Turmblasen „ein Freuden und Friedens-Zeichen“ sieht, da „wo solche Musik muss eingestellet werden, gewiss ein Land-Trauern, Krieg oder sonst ein Unglück zu beweinen ist“, so könnte die Turmmusik als ein solches „Freuden- und Friedens-Zeichen“ auch das geistig-kulturelle Leben unserer Stadt wesentlich bereichern.{{refn|name=Nikolaikirche|{{cite web| title=Turmmusik vom Nikolaikirchturm |publisher=Kulturbund der DDR, Gesellschaft für Heimatgeschichte, Kreisvorstand Altenburg |volume=Heft 1 |year=1983 |url=http://geo.viaregia.org/testbed/pool/Altenburg/T1_335_Turmmusik_vom_Nicolaikirchturm.htm |accessdate=26 September 2017}} }}  }}

Although the revival of music in churches was a particularly [[Lutheran]] initiative, Catholic areas like Vienna and [[Salzburg]] were just as keen to promote tower music.{{sfn|Spitzer|2017|p=228}} Among the most popular of tunes were the ''Heilig-Leider'', paraphrases in German of the [[Sanctus]] from the Latin [[Mass (religion)|Mass]], which came into fashion after the enlightened reforms of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]]&lt;!--Although there was never a Joseph II... --&gt; promoted the use of the [[vernacular]] in church services.{{sfn|Spitzer|2017|p=228}} According to one Stadtpfeifer named Hornbock, quoted in [[Johann Kuhnau]]'s ''Quack-Salber'': "We know from experience that when our city pipers in the festive season play a religious song with nothing but trombones from the tower, then we are greatly moved, and imagine that we hear the angels singing.".{{sfn|Spitzer|2017|p=228}}

In Austria, trombones were typically played from church towers (German ''Turmblasen'', lit 'tower blowing') or in cemeteries on [[All Souls' Day]] and the previous day ([[Hallowe'en]] in England). Their use is mentioned in a handbook explaining the multitude of church music regulations, ''Kirchenmusik-Ordnung'' (1828), by the Linz Stadtpfeifer [[Franz Xaver Glöggl|Franz Glöggl]].{{sfn|Glöggl|1828|p=}}{{efn|A review of the book shows how useful the book was in gathering together and explaining the many rules concerning music at church services.&lt;br&gt;
:"There appears an explanatory guide of musical worship, according to the existing church music-order for all functions occurring on Sundays, festivals, vespers, litanies, masses, funerals, processions etc. while chants, songs for the congregation, motets, introiten, versicles, graduals, offertories, responses etc. It explains the ritual-texts from the measurement book and Breviarium, and is found at a very cheap price.  In all countries where Roman Catholic worship prevails, through its essential usefulness of numerous sales, where the lack of such a reliable signpost has been felt for a long time: until the present moment when -wonderfully enough - under the supervision of some well-informed experts - the simple expedient of this book has been devised."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/allgemeinemusik16unkngoog/ ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'']. No. 6, 13 February 1828 (in German). Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Glöggl commissioned the Three Equals from Beethoven in 1812.{{sfn|Henke|Winkler|2002|pp=225-6}}{{sfn|B&amp;H Revisionsbericht|1888|p=vi}} They were both pupils of [[Johann Albrechtsberger]] (d. 1807), who wrote one of the first trombone concertos.{{sfn|Bassano|n.d.|}}

Tower music reached a peak in around 1750, and thereafter declined towards the end of the 18th century. From around 1800 official civic concerts began to replace those given by the nobility, and what has been termed "Saint Culture" ('''St''.-Kultur') suffered a split, leading on one side to the growth of professional [[symphony orchestra]]s, and on the other to amateur ''Stadtkapellen'' conducted by professional or semi-professional town music directors.{{sfn|Suppan|2006|}}

Modern tower music is common in German-speaking areas.

'''William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB}} (5 March 1879 – 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted [[Progressivism|progressive]] and social reformer.

He is best known for his 1942 report ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'' (known as the ''[[Beveridge Report]]'') which served as the basis for the post-[[World War II]] [[welfare state]] put in place by the [[Labour Government 1945–1951|Labour government elected in 1945]]. He was considered an authority on [[unemployment insurance]] from early in his career, served under [[Winston Churchill]] on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created [[labour exchange]]s and later as Permanent Secretary of the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]]. He was Director of the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of [[University College, Oxford]]. Beveridge published widely on unemployment and [[social security]], his most notable works being: ''Unemployment: A Problem of Industry'' (1909), ''Planning Under Socialism'' (1936), ''[[Full Employment in a Free Society]]'' (1944), ''Pillars of Security'' (1943), ''Power and Influence'' (1953), and ''A Defence of Free Learning'' (1959).

==Early life and education==
[[File:William Beveridge at Balliol 1898, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beveridge at Balliol College in 1898]]
Beveridge, the eldest son of [[Henry Beveridge]], an [[Indian Civil Service]] officer and District Judge, and scholar [[Annette Beveridge|Annette Ackroyd]], was born in Rangpur, [[British India]] (now [[Rangpur (city), Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Bangladesh]]), on 5 March 1879. 

Beveridge's mother had, with [[Elizabeth Malleson]], founded the Working Women's College in [[Queen Square, London]] in 1864. She met and married Henry Beveridge in Calcutta where she had gone in 1873 to open a school for Indian girls. William Beveridge was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], a leading [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] near the market town of [[Godalming]] in Surrey, followed by [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied Mathematics and Classics, obtaining a [[first class degree]] in both. He later studied law.&lt;ref name="Harris43"&gt;Jose Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 43-78. &lt;/ref&gt;

While Beveridge's mother had been a member of the [[Stourbridge]] Unitarian community,&lt;ref name="Harris43"/&gt; his father was an early [[religious humanism|humanist]] and [[positivism|positivist]] activist and "an ardent disciple" of the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]. Comte's ideas of a secular [[religion of humanity]] were a prominent influence in the household and would exert a lasting influence on Beveridge's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fabians.org.uk/who-was-william-beveridge/|publisher=[[Fabian Society]]|title=Who Was William Beveridge|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge himself became a "[[Materialism|materialist]] [[agnosticism|agnostic]]", in his words.&lt;ref name="Harris1-323"&gt;Jose Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 1, 323. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the [[social services]] and wrote about the subject for the ''[[Morning Post]]'' newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at [[Toynbee Hall]], a [[settlement house]] in London. There he worked closely with [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting [[old age pensions]], [[School meal|free school meals]], and campaigning for a national system of [[labour exchange]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 98-117. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, now considered to be Britain's leading authority on [[unemployment insurance]], he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to [[Winston Churchill]], who had recently been promoted to the [[First Asquith ministry|Cabinet]] as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and [[National Insurance]] to combat unemployment and poverty. During the [[First World War]] he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 196-227. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on [[social policy]]. He was so highly influenced by the [[Fabian Society]] socialists – in particular by [[Beatrice Webb]], with whom he worked on the 1909 ''Poor Laws'' report – that he could be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909).  The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with [[Edwin Cannan]] and [[Lionel Robbins]], who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 257-76. &lt;/ref&gt; From 1929 he led the [[International scientific committee on price history]], contributing a large historical study, ''Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Century'' (1939).

In 1933 he helped set up the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]]. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape [[Nazi]] persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[University College, Oxford]].

==Wartime work==
[[File:Sir W.H. Beveridge, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing left.jpg|thumb|upright|Beveridge in the 1910s]]

Three years later, [[Ernest Bevin]], Minister of Labour in the wartime National government, invited Beveridge to take charge of the Welfare department of his Ministry. Beveridge refused, but declared an interest in organising British manpower in wartime (Beveridge had come to favour a strong system of centralised planning). Bevin was reluctant to let Beveridge have his way but did commission him to work on a relatively unimportant manpower survey from June 1940 and so Beveridge became a temporary civil servant. Neither Bevin nor the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry [[Thomas Williams Phillips|Sir Thomas Phillips]] liked working with Beveridge as both found him conceited.&lt;ref name="Manpower survey"&gt;Paul Addison, ''The Road to 1945'', Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on manpower culminated in his chairmanship of the Committee on Skilled Men in the Services which reported to the War Cabinet in August and October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/small/cab-66-21-wp-42-44-24.pdf|title=Cabinet memorandum: The Committee on Skilled Men in the Services|last=Secretary of State for War|first=|date=29 January 1942|website=The National Archives|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two recommendations of the committee were implemented: Army recruits were enlisted for their first six weeks into the [[General Service Corps]], so that their subsequent posting could take account of their skills and the Army's needs; and the [[Corps Of Royal Electrical And Mechanical Engineers|Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] was created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Report on social insurance===
An opportunity for Bevin to ease Beveridge out presented itself in May 1941 when Minister of Health [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]] announced the formation of a committee of officials to survey existing social insurance and allied services, and to make recommendations. Although Brown had made the announcement, the inquiry had largely been urged by Minister without Portfolio [[Arthur Greenwood]], and Bevin suggested to Greenwood making Beveridge chairman of the committee. Beveridge, at first uninterested and seeing the committee as a distraction from his work on manpower, accepted only reluctantly.&lt;ref name="Beveridge committee"&gt;[[Paul Addison]], "The Road to 1945", Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report to the Parliament on ''[[Beveridge Report|Social Insurance and Allied Services]]'' was published in November 1942. It proposed that all people of [[working age]] should pay a weekly [[national insurance]] contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. Beveridge argued that this system would provide a minimum standard of living "below which no one should be allowed to fall". It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the "five giants on the road of reconstruction" of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Beveridge included as one of three fundamental assumptions the fact that there would be a National Health Service of some sort, a policy already being worked on in the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="Beveridge report"&gt;Paul Addison, "The Road to 1945", Jonathan Cape, 1975, pp. 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beveridge's arguments were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics by arguing that welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of [[corporation|corporate]] ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as a great source of demand for British goods.

Beveridge saw [[full employment]] (defined as unemployment of no more than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. ''[[Full Employment in a Free Society]]'', written in 1944 expressed how this goal might be gained.&lt;ref&gt;According to Nobel Laureate [[Friedrich Hayek]], this book was ghostwritten by [[Nicholas Kaldor]]. Hayek said that Beveridge "wasn't the least interested in economics. He knew no economics whatever."  Cf. Kresge, Stephan, and Wenar, Leif, ''Hayek on Hayek'', (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative measures for achieving it included [[Keynesian]]-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's thinking was [[social justice]], and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.

==Later career==
[[File:The Home Front in Britain 1939-1945 TR1625.jpg|thumb|upright|Beveridge talking to an American fighter pilot hospitalised at [[University College, Oxford]] during the [[Second World War]]]]
Later in 1944, Beveridge, who had recently joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in a [[Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election, 1944|by-election]] to succeed [[George Charles Grey]], who had died on the battlefield in [[Normandy]], France, on the first day of [[Operation Bluecoat]] on 30 July 1944. Beveridge briefly served as [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the constituency of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]], during which time he was prominent in the [[Radical Action]] group, which called for the party to withdraw from the [[war-time electoral pact]] and adopt more radical policies. However, he lost his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], when he was defeated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, [[Robert Thorp]], by a majority of 1,962 votes.

The following year, the new Labour Government began the process of implementing Beveridge's proposals that provided the basis of the modern Welfare State. [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] defeated [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]. Attlee announced he would introduce the Welfare State outlined in the 1942 Beveridge Report. This included the establishment of a [[History of the National Health Service|National Health Service in 1948]] with taxpayer funded medical treatment for all. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide "social security" so that the population would be protected from the "cradle to the grave". The new system was partly built upon the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Insurance scheme]] set up by Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George in 1911.

In 1946, Beveridge was elevated to the House of Lords as '''Baron Beveridge''', of Tuggal in the County of [[Northumberland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37627 |date=25 June 1946 |page=3229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually became leader of the Liberal Party in the [[House of Lords]]. He was the author of ''Power and Influence'' (1953).

He was the President of the charity Attend&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attend.org.uk/about-us/people-we-honour-0/attend-vips "Attend VIPs"]. ''attend.org.uk''. Retrieved on 29 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (then the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1952–1962.

==Eugenics==
Beveridge was a member of the [[Galton Institute|Eugenics Society]], which promoted the study of methods to 'improve' the human race by [[Eugenics|controlling reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/society/2010/12/british-eugenics-disabled|title=The eugenics movement Britain wants to forget|last=Brignell|first=Victoria|date=9 December 2010|website=New Statesman|access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Eugenics_Literature_and_Culture_in_Post.html?id=kaVoJemPPlAC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Eugenics, Literature, and Culture in Post-war Britain|first=Clare|last=Hanson|date=5 July 2018|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/about/|title=About – The Galton Institute|website=www.galtoninstitute.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, he proposed that men who could not work should be supported by the state "but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Sewell  | first = Dennis  | author-link =   | last2 =   | first2 =   | author2-link =   | title = How eugenics poisoned the welfare state  | newspaper = The Spectator  | pages =   | date = November 2009  | url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5571423/how-eugenics-poisoned-the-welfare-state.thtml  | access-date = 6 December 2009  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101128141116/http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5571423/how-eugenics-poisoned-the-welfare-state.thtml  | archive-date = 28 November 2010  | dead-url = yes  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst director of the London School of Economics, Beveridge attempted to create a Department of Social Biology. Though never fully established, [[Lancelot Hogben]], a fierce anti-eugenicist, was named its chair. Former LSE director [[John Ashworth (scientist)|John Ashworth]] speculated that discord between those in favour and those against the serious study of eugenics led to Beveridge's departure from the school in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=145449&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Five years of Darwin seminars: a paradigm shift? &amp;#124; General |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |date=12 March 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, Beveridge credited the Eugenics Society with promoting the [[Child benefit#United Kingdom|children's allowance]], which was incorporated into his 1942 report. However, whilst he held views in support of eugenics, he did not believe the report had any overall "eugenic value".&lt;ref&gt;''Eugenics Review'' 1944 April; 36(1): pp. 17–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Danny Dorling]] of the [[University of Sheffield]] says "there is not even the faintest hint" of eugenic thought in the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rofea.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/20/9&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Sewell states that "On the day the House of Commons met to debate the Beveridge Report in 1943, its author slipped out of the gallery early in the evening to address a meeting of the Eugenics Society at the Mansion House.  ...  His report he was keen to reassure them, was eugenic in intent and would prove so in effect.  ...  The idea of child allowances had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, to limit the number of children born to poor households.  For both effects to be properly stimulated, the allowance needed to be graded: middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents.  ...  The Home Secretary had that very day signalled that the government planned a flat rate of child allowance. But Beveridge, alluding to the problem of an overall declining birth rate, argued that even the flat rate would be eugenic. Nevertheless, he held out hope for the purists."  'Sir William made it clear that it was in his view not only possible but desirable that  graded family allowance schemes, applicable to families in the higher income brackets, be administered concurrently with his flat rate scheme,' reported the Eugenics Review.&lt;ref&gt;''Eugenics Review'' 1943; vol. 35, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2het_tm-ToC|title=The Political Gene: How Darwin's Ideas Changed Politics|author=Dennis Sewell|publisher=Picador|year=2009|isbn=978-0-330-42744-9|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the [[World Kindness Movement]], a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates]]. In 2009, [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time.  [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]]. In 2010 at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012 At the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3&amp;4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarcek as part of their project Randomised Kindess.

World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
