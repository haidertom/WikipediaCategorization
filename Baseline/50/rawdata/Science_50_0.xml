The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

ADRON-RM is a near copy of ADRO-EM on the stationary [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] and  the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) neutron detector on board NASA's [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]], all designed by Igor Mitrofanov from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).  

==Overview==

ADRON-RM is a [[Neutron spectroscopy|neutron spectrometer]] that will search for hydrogen in the form of bound water or water ice, and hydrogen-bearing compounds. It will be used in combination with WISDOM instrument (a [[ground-penetrating radar]]) to study the subsurface beneath the rover and to search for optimal sites for drilling and sample collection.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'&gt; [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2016.1566 The ADRON-RM Instrument Onboard the ExoMars Rover].

The [[Principal Investigator]] is Igor Mitrofanov from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).&lt;ref name="2018-iki"/&gt; The instrument is almost a reproduction of the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) neutron detector on board NASA's ''[[Curiosity rover]]'' also developed in Russia.&lt;ref name="Mars Science Laboratory: Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/radiationdetectors/dan/ |title=Mars Science Laboratory: Mission |publisher=NASA/JPL |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20130408"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1461 |title=Remaining Martian Atmosphere Still Dynamic |publisher=NASA |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=April 8, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitrofanov is also developing the active gamma and neutron spectrometer, '''ADRON-EM''' (Active Detection of Radiation of Nuclei-ExoMars) for the stationary [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] —the primary goal of which will be to measure water distribution in the Martian subsurface.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt; Measurements by ADRON-RM and ADRON-EM will work in synergy with other ExoMars instruments.

ADRON-RM uses two [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] [[proportional counter]]s with a cylindrical shape of about 25  mm in diameter and 55  mm in total length. Each counter is filled with &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He gas under 4 atmospheres of pressure.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt; Each neutron detector will measure two 32-channel spectra. The data will be obtained as routine and passive measurements, which will not be saved but will be immediately transmitted from the instrument to the rover computer. This means that all ADRON-RM measurements will be performed only when the 'Rover Compute Element' is active (daytime).&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt;

ADRON-RM is installed inside the ExoMars rover body at the rear balcony. The height above the surface is 0.8 m (2.6 ft)

==Objectives==

The stated objectives of the ADRON-RM scientific investigation include:&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt;
*Measurement of the distribution of bulk hydrogen content in the form of free or bound water.
*Evaluation of the bulk composition of major soil neutron absorption elements ([[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[Titanium|Ti]] [[Sulfur|S]], etc.)
*Monitoring of the neutron component of the natural radiation background and estimation of neutron radiation dose at the [[Martian surface]] from [[Galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar particle event]]s.
*The potential to monitor seasonal changes of the neutron environment due to variations of atmospheric and subsurface properties.

'''Artificial seawater''' ([[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''ASW''') is a mixture of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|mineral salts]] (and sometimes [[vitamin]]s) that simulates [[seawater]]. Artificial seawater is primarily used in [[marine biology]] and in [[marine aquarium|marine]] and [[reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], and allows the easy preparation of [[growth medium|media]] appropriate for marine [[organism]]s (including [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s). From a [[scientific method|scientific perspective]], artificial seawater has the advantage of [[reproducibility]] over natural seawater since it is a standardized formula. Synthetic seawater is also known as artificial seawater and substitute ocean water. 

==Example==
The tables below present an example of an artificial seawater (35.00[[Per mille|‰]] of salinity) preparation devised by Kester, Duedall, Connors and Pytkowicz (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Kester, D. R., Duedall, I. W., Connors, D. N. and Pytkowicz, R. M. (1967).

''Limnology &amp; Oceanography'' '''12''', 176—179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipe consists of two lists of mineral salts, the first of [[anhydrous]] salts that can be weighed out, the second of [[hydrate|hydrous]] salts that should be added to the artificial seawater as a solution.

While all of the compounds listed in the recipe above are [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], mineral salts, some artificial seawater recipes, such as Goldman and McCarthy (1978),&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, J. C. and McCarthy, J. J. (1978).

''Limnology &amp; Oceanography'' '''23''', 695–703.&lt;/ref&gt; make use of trace solutions of [[vitamin]]s or [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds.

==Standard==
The International Standard for making Artificial Seawater can be found at [[ASTM International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D1141.htm |title=Standard Practice for the Preparation of Substitute Ocean Water |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=ASTM International |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current standard is named ASTM D1141-98 (the original standard was ASTM D1141-52) and describes the standard practice for the preparation of substitute ocean water. 

==Uses==
There are various applications for ASTM D1141-98 synthetic seawater including [[corrosion]] studies, ocean [[Calibration#Instrument calibration|instrument calibration]] and chemical processing. Typically, laboratory grade water is used when making synthetic salts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.g2mtlabs.com/artificial-seawater-aka-synthetic-seawater-substitute-ocean-water-astm-d1141-salts-solutions/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Association theory''' (also '''aggregate theory''') is a discredited theory first advanced by chemist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] in 1861 to describe the molecular structure of substances such as [[cellulose]] and [[starch]], now understood to be [[polymer]]s.  Association theory postulates that such materials are composed of a collection of smaller molecules bound together by an unknown force.  Graham termed these materials [[colloids]].  Prior to the development of [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] theory by [[Hermann Staudinger]] in the 1920s, association theory remained the most prevalent model of polymer structure in the scientific community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">'''Backward induction''' is the process of reasoning backwards in time, from the end of a problem or situation, to determine a sequence of optimal actions. It proceeds by first considering the last time a decision might be made and choosing what to do in any situation at that time. Using this information, one can then determine what to do at the second-to-last time of decision. This process continues backwards until one has determined the best action for every possible situation (i.e. for every possible [[information set (game theory)|information set]]) at every point in time.

In the mathematical [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] method of [[dynamic programming]], backward induction is one of the main methods for solving the [[Bellman equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Adda and Russell Cooper, "Dynamic Economics: Quantitative Methods and Applications", Section 3.2.1, page 28. MIT Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Miranda and Paul Fackler, "Applied Computational Economics and Finance", Section 7.3.1, page 164. MIT Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[game theory]], backward induction is a method used to compute [[subgame perfection|subgame perfect equilibria]] in [[sequential game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Fudenberg and Jean Tirole, "Game Theory", Section 3.5, page 92. MIT Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The only difference is that optimization involves just one [[Decision theory|decision maker]], who chooses what to do at each point of time, whereas game theory analyzes how the decisions of several [[Player (game)|player]]s interact. That is, by anticipating what the last player will do in each situation, it is possible to determine what the second-to-last player will do, and so on.  In the related fields of [[automated planning and scheduling]] and [[automated theorem proving]], the method is called '''backward search''' or '''[[backward chaining]]'''. In chess it is called [[retrograde analysis]].

Backward induction has been used to solve games as long as the field of game theory has existed. [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] suggested solving [[zero-sum]], two-person games by backward induction in their ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'' (1944), the book which established game theory as a field of study.&lt;ref&gt;John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior", Section 15.3.1. Princeton University Press. [https://archive.org/details/theoryofgamesand030098mbp Third edition, 1953.] (First edition, 1944.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/MacQuarrie/Chapters/Ch4.html Mathematics of Chess], webpage by John MacQuarrie.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An example of decision-making by backward induction==

Consider an unemployed person who will be able to work for ten more years ''t'' = 1,2,...,10. Suppose that each year in which he remains unemployed, he may be offered a 'good' job that pays $100, or a 'bad' job that pays $44, with equal probability (50/50). Once he accepts a job, he will remain in that job for the rest of the ten years. (Assume for simplicity that he cares only about his monetary earnings, and that he values earnings at different times equally, i.e., the [[Time preference|discount rate]] is zero.)

Should this person accept bad jobs? To answer this question, we can reason backwards from time ''t'' = 10.
*At time 10, the value of accepting a good job is $100; the value of accepting a bad job is $44; the value of rejecting the job that is available is zero. Therefore, if he is still unemployed in the last period, he should accept whatever job he is offered at that time.
*At time 9, the value of accepting a good job is $200 (because that job will last for two years); the value of accepting a bad job is 2*$44 = $88. The value of rejecting a job offer is $0 now, plus the value of waiting for the next job offer, which will either be $44 with 50% probability or $100 with 50% probability, for an average ('expected') value of 0.5*($100+$44) = $72. Therefore, regardless of whether the job available at time 9 is good or bad, it is better to accept that offer than wait for a better one.
*At time 8, the value of accepting a good job is $300 (it will last for three years); the value of accepting a bad job is 3*$44 = $132. The value of rejecting a job offer is $0 now, plus the value of waiting for a job offer at time 9. Since we have already concluded that offers at time 9 should be accepted, the expected value of waiting for a job offer at time 9 is 0.5*($200+$88) = $144. Therefore, at time 8, it is more valuable to wait for the next offer than to accept a bad job.

It can be verified by continuing to work backwards that bad offers should only be accepted if one is still unemployed at times 9 or 10; they should be rejected at all times up to ''t'' = 8. The intuition is that if one expects to work in a job for a long time, this makes it more valuable to be picky about what job to accept.

A dynamic optimization problem of this kind is called an [[optimal stopping]] problem, because the issue at hand is when to stop waiting for a better offer. [[Search theory]] is the field of microeconomics that applies problems of this type to contexts like shopping, job search, and marriage.

==An example of backward induction in game theory==

Consider the [[ultimatum game]], where one player proposes to split a dollar with another.  The first player (the proposer) suggests a division of the dollar between the two players.  The second player is then given the option to either accept the split or reject it.  If the second player accepts, both get the amount suggested by the proposer.  If rejected, neither receives anything.

Consider the actions of the second player given any arbitrary proposal by the first player (that gives the second player more than zero).  Since the only choice the second player has at each of these points in the game is to choose between something and nothing, one can expect that the second will accept.  Given that the second will accept all proposals offered by the first (that give the second anything at all), the first ought to propose giving the second as little as possible.  This is the unique [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] of the Ultimatum Game.  (However, the Ultimatum Game does have several other [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] which are not subgame perfect.)

See also [[centipede game]].

== Backward induction and economic entry ==

Consider a [[dynamic game]] in which the players are an incumbent firm in an industry and a potential entrant to that industry. As it stands, the incumbent has a [[monopoly]] over the industry and does not want to lose some of its market share to the entrant. If the entrant chooses not to enter, the payoff to the incumbent is high (it maintains its monopoly) and the entrant neither loses nor gains (its payoff is zero). If the entrant enters, the incumbent can "fight" or "accommodate" the entrant. It will fight by lowering its price, running the entrant out of business (and incurring exit costs &amp;mdash; a negative payoff) and damaging its own profits. If it accommodates the entrant it will lose some of its sales, but a high price will be maintained and it will receive greater profits than by lowering its price (but lower than monopoly profits).

Consider if the best response of the incumbent is to accommodate if the entrant enters. If the incumbent accommodates, the best response of the entrant is to enter (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the entrant enters and the incumbent accommodates if the entrant enters is a [[Nash equilibrium]] consistent with backward induction. However, if the incumbent is going to fight, the best response of the entrant is to not enter, and if the entrant does not enter, it does not matter what the incumbent chooses to do in the hypothetical case that the entrant does enter. Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the entrant enters, but the entrant does not enter is also a Nash equilibrium. However, were the entrant to deviate and enter, the incumbent's best response is to accommodate—the threat of fighting is not credible. This second Nash equilibrium can therefore be eliminated by backward induction.

== A paradox of backward induction ==

The [[unexpected hanging paradox]] is a [[paradox]] related to backward induction.  Suppose a prisoner is told that she will be hanged sometime between Monday and Friday of next week.  However, the exact day will be a surprise (i.e. she will not know the night before that she will be executed the next day).  The prisoner, interested in outsmarting her executioner, attempts to determine which day the execution will occur.

She reasons that it cannot occur on Friday, since if it had not occurred by the end of Thursday, she would know the execution would be on Friday.  Therefore, she can eliminate Friday as a possibility.  With Friday eliminated, she decides that it cannot occur on Thursday, since if it had not occurred on Wednesday, she would know that it had to be on Thursday.  Therefore, she can eliminate Thursday.  This reasoning proceeds until she has eliminated all possibilities.  She concludes that she will not be hanged next week.

To her surprise, she is hanged on Wednesday. She made the mistake of assuming that she knew definitively whether the unknown future factor that would cause her execution was one that she could reason about.

Here the prisoner reasons by backward induction, but seems to come to a false conclusion. Note, however, that the description of the problem assumes it is possible to surprise someone who is performing backward induction. The mathematical theory of backward induction does not make this assumption, so the paradox does not call into question the results of this theory. Nonetheless, this paradox has received some substantial discussion by philosophers.

The '''International Balzan Prize Foundation''' awards four annual monetary prizes to [[List of Balzan Prize Winners|people or organizations]] who have made outstanding achievements in the fields of humanities, natural sciences, culture, as well as for endeavours for peace and the brotherhood of man.

==Rewards and assets==

Each year the foundation chooses the fields eligible for the next year's prizes, and determines the prize amount. These are generally announced in May, with the winners announced the September the following year. Since 2001 the prize money has increased to 1 million [[Swiss Franc]]s per prize, on condition that half the money is used for projects involving young researchers.

The Balzan Prize committee comprises twenty members of the prestigious learned societies of Europe.

The assets behind the foundation were established by the Italian '''Eugenio Balzan''' {{small|([[:it:Eugenio Balzan|it]])}} (1874–1953), a part-owner of ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' who had invested his assets in [[Switzerland]] and in 1933 had left Italy in protest against fascism. He left a substantial inheritance to his daughter Angela Lina Balzan (1892–1956), who at the time was suffering an incurable disease. Before her death, she left instructions for the foundation and since then it has two headquarters, the Prize administered from Milan, the Fund from Zurich.

The first award was in fact 1 million Swiss francs to the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel foundation]] in 1961. After 1962 a gap of 16 years followed when prizes recommenced with an award of half a million Swiss francs to [[Mother Teresa]]. Award ceremonies alternate between [[Bern]] and the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in Rome, and frequently winners have later won a Nobel Prize.

The amount of each of the four Balzan Prizes is now 750,000 [[Swiss franc]]s (approx. €700,000; $790,000; £500,000).

All awards are decided by a single committee.

==Categories==

Four prizes have been awarded annually since 1978. The award fields vary each year and can be related to either a specific or an interdisciplinary field. The prizes go beyond the traditional subjects both in the humanities (literature, the moral sciences and the arts) and in the sciences (medicine and the physical, mathematical and natural sciences), with an emphasis on innovative research.

Every 3 to 7 years the foundation also awards the ''Prize for humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples''. It was last awarded in 2014 to [[Vivre en Famille]].

[[Captive animal|Captive]] [[white tiger]]s are of little known lineage. They are held captive around the world, usually for financial purposes. The Tiger [[Species Survival Plan]] devised by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] has condemned the breeding of [[white tiger]]s. The [[gene]]s responsible for white colour are represented by 0.001% of the tiger population. However, in 2008–2009, a closing stock of 264 [[Bengal tiger]]s and 100 white Bengal tigers were accounted for in Indian zoos. The disproportionate growth in numbers of the latter points to the relentless [[inbreeding]] resorted to among [[homozygous]] [[recessive]] individuals for selectively multiplying the white animals. This progressively increasing process will eventually lead to [[inbreeding depression]] and loss of [[genetic variability]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, N. (2010) [http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/10oct2010/894.pdf ''A new conservation policy needed for reintroduction of Bengal tiger-white'']. Current Science 99 (7): 894–895.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohan and the Rewa strain==
[[File:A caring mom.jpg|thumb|A white tigress with her cubs.]]

'''Mohan''' was the founding father of the [[white tiger]]s of [[Rewa, India|Rewa]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Nostrand, Mary L., "Mohan The Ghost Tiger Of Rewa", Zoonooz May 1984 pgs. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured as a cub in 1951 by [[Maharaja]] of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banglalive.com/News/SpecialNewsDetail/6173 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902213942/http://www.banglalive.com/News/SpecialNewsDetail/6173 |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose hunting party in [[Bandhavgarh National Park|Bandhavgarh]] found a tigress with four 9-month-old cubs, one of which was white. All of them were shot except for the white cub. After shooting a white tiger in 1948 the Maharaja of Rewa had resolved to capture one, as his father had done in 1915, at his next opportunity. Water was used to lure the thirsty cub into a cage, after he returned to a kill made by his mother. The white cub mauled a man during the capture process and was clubbed on the head and knocked unconscious. He was not necessarily expected to wake up, and this was his second brush with death. He recovered though, and was housed in the unused palace at [[Govindgarh, Madhya Pradesh|Govindgarh]] in the erstwhile harem courtyard. The Maharaja named him Mohan, which roughly translates as "Enchanter", one of the many names of the [[Hindu]] deity [[Krishna]].The name of the Maharaja was Raja Martand Singh.

The white tiger the previous Maharaja had kept in captivity from 1915 to 1920 was also a male, unusually large like most white tigers (Mohan was no exception in this regard), and had a white male sibling still living in the wild. After the captive white tiger's death in 1920 he was mounted and presented to the Emperor [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], as a token of loyalty.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"&gt;Sankhala, K.S., Tiger ! The Story Of The Indian Tiger, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  This specimen is now in the [[British Museum]]. The first live white tiger reached England in 1820, and was exhibited at [[London]]'s [[Exeter Exchange|Exeter Change]] menagerie where it was examined by the famous [[France|French]] [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Georges Cuvier]], who described it in his "Animal Kingdom" as having faint stripes only visible from certain angles of refraction. In 1960 there was a mounted white tiger, with faint reddish brown stripes, in the throne room of the Maharaja of Rewa.

In 1953, Mohan was bred&lt;ref&gt;Alderton, David, Wild Cats Of The World, Blandford UK London 1993 pgs. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; to a normal-coloured wild tigress called Begum ("royal consort"), which produced two male orange cubs on September 7, one of which went to Bombay Zoo.  In 1955 they had a [[litter (animal)|litter]] of two males and two females on April 10 (which included a male named Sampson and a female named Radha), all normal-coloured. On July 10, 1956 they again had a litter of two males and two females, which included a male named Sultan who went to Ahmedabad Zoo, and a female named Vindhya who went to the [[Delhi Zoo]] and was later bred to an unrelated male named Suraj.&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton, I.W.B., K.K. Yeung &amp; K.S. Sankhala. 1967. The genetics of white tigers in Rewa. J. Zool. 152: 127–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again, the breeding experiments failed to yield a single white cub.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt;

Mohan was then bred to his daughter Radha (who carried the white gene inherited from her father) with success. The initial litter of four cubs—a male named Raja, and three females named Rani, Mohini, and Sukeshi—were the first white tigers born in captivity, on October 30, 1958.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stracey, P.D., Tigers, London: Baker, New York: Golden P., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Raja and Rani went to the New Delhi Zoo, and Mohini was bought by the German-American billionaire [[John Kluge]]&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, Theodore H. "Enchantess: Queen Of An Indian Palace Rare White Tigress Comes To Washington." ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' May 1961&lt;/ref&gt; for $10,000, for the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo in Washington D.C.]], as a gift to the children of [[United States|America]], in 1960.

The [[Government of India]] made a deal with the Maharaja, under the terms of which Raja and Rani would go to the New Delhi Zoo&lt;ref&gt;Husain, Dawar, Breeding And Hand-Rearing Of White Tiger Cubs Panthera tigris At New Delhi Zoo, International Zoo Yearbook Vol. VI 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sankhala, Kailash, Breeding Behavior Of The Tiger Panthera tigris In Rajasthan, International Zoo Yearbook Vol. VII 1967 pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; for free. In exchange the Maharaja's white tiger breeding would be subsidized and he would receive a share of their cubs. He wanted Rs 100,000 for them. Technically Sukeshi was also the property of the New Delhi Zoo, and in a sense India had nationalized the captive white tigers of Rewa. The [[Parliament of India]] would hear reports on the progress of the white tigers, and [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[U Nu]] of [[Burma]] participated in public christening ceremonies for white cubs at New Delhi Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Rai, Usha. 1987, Will they outlast this century? Times of India, New Delhi March 15&lt;/ref&gt; Sukeshi remained at Govindgarh Palace, in the harem courtyard where she was born, as a mate for Mohan.

That same year, India imposed a ban on the export of white tigers,&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;Roth, T.W. "Rare White Tiger Of Rewa" Journal of cat Genetics Vol. 1 April May June 1964 No. 3;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gee"&gt;Gee, E.P.,"The White Tigers" Animals 3:282–286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"White tiger exports banned", N.Y. Times D.4, 1960 12:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;Beatty, Clyde, "Facing The Big Cats" (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Phil, Disenchanted India Stops Export Of White Tigers After City Gets One, The Washington Post Dec. 4, 1960 pg. A1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert, "Ike, Priceless White Tigress Meet On Lawn, President Views Cat at White House", The Chicago Tribune Dec. 6, 1960, pg. A11&lt;/ref&gt;  in an effort to preserve a monopoly (as a tourist attraction), possibly because Anglo-Indian naturalist [[Edward Pritchard Gee]] recommended that Govindgarh Palace, and its white tiger inhabitants, be made a "national trust", which did not happen. Mohini was only allowed to leave India because US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] intervened personally with Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to ask for the release of the United States government's white tiger. A white sister of Mohini's had been brought to New Delhi the year before to show the President, who was no stranger to white tigers. After the export ban was imposed the Maharaja threatened to release all of his white tigers into the Rewa forest, and so he was given dispensation to sell two more pairs abroad, to offset his costs.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, E.P., "The Wildlife Of India" London: Collins 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Six zoos acquired white tigers from the Maharaja of Rewa including the [[Bristol Zoo]] in [[England]] (a brother and sister pair named Champak and Chameli on June 22, 1963 for the equivalent of $10,000 each.)&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"White tigers at Bristol Zoo", The Times August 17, 1963, pg. 8b.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Crandon Park]] Zoo (which closed around 1983, and moved out of Crandon Park to the site of the [[Zoo Miami|Miami MetroZoo]]) in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] acquired a white tigress in 1968.&lt;ref name="international1977"&gt;Cousins, D., 1977 The white tiger and its status in captivity. International Zoo News 24(7) 147:16–19&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol Zoo's pair, born in 1962, came from another litter of four, all white, but two (one female and one male) did not survive. Years later the Bristol Zoo needed a new breeding male and traded a white female to New Delhi Zoo for a white tiger named Roop, who had been named by U Nu, the Prime Minister of Burma.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt; He was the son of Raja by his own mother and half sister- Radha, born in New Delhi. Radha, and many other tigers from Govindgarh including Sukeshi, were later transferred to New Delhi. Begum went to live at Ahmedabad Zoo and was bred to her son Sultan. They produced twelve cubs in four litters between 1958 and 1961.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; Bristol Zoo later transferred two male white tigers to [[Dudley Zoo]].
[[File:Kpsimascot.jpg|thumb|A white [[Bengal tiger]] in [[National Zoological Park Delhi]], India.]]
The government of [[West Bengal]] bought two white males, named Niladari and Himadri, from the Maharaja for the [[Alipore Zoological Gardens]] (Calcutta Zoo), and an orange female named Malini, from the same litter of three born in 1960, accompanied them there. The Alipore Zoo in [[Kolkata]], recovered the purchase price of its white tigers within six months by charging extra to see them. By 1966 the Bombay Zoo had a white tigress named Lakshmi, born in 1964, from the Maharaja. The Calcutta Zoo sold a white tigress named Sefali to Gauhati Zoo and sent a second white tiger there on loan. Circus owner [[Clyde Beatty]] also bought a white tiger from the Maharaja in 1960, for $10,000 in a deal facilitated by the Smithsonian National Zoo director T.H. Reed, who had traveled to India to escort Mohini to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which had to be canceled because of the export ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made Mohini even more valuable. She was estimated to be worth $28,000. President [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] of [[Yugoslavia]] visited New Delhi Zoo and asked for white tigers for [[Belgrade]] Zoo, but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, J.H., &amp; Malhotra, A.K., "The White Tiger" New Delhi Publications, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  A white tiger named Dalip from New Delhi Zoo represented India in two international expositions in [[Budapest]] and [[Osaka]]. A white tigress named Nandni, who was born in New Delhi Zoo in 1971, went to Hyderabad Zoo.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; By 1976 the Lucknow Zoo also had a white tiger which was a gift from New Delhi Zoo. Zoos with white tigers constituted a most exclusive club and the white tigers themselves represented a single extended family. In 1965 or 1966 Terence Walton, a member of the Maharaja of Rewa's staff, was attending a performance of the Ringling Bros. Circus in [[Madison Square Garden]] and had a note passed to tiger trainer Charles Baumann, on the Maharaja's stationary, requesting an opportunity to discuss white tigers. He may have hoped to make a sale. Baumann was invited to Rewa, but was not able to go.

Mohan was featured in the National Geographic documentary "Great Zoos Of The World" in 1970.
He died later that year, aged almost 20, and was laid to rest with [[Hindu]] rites as the palace staff observed official mourning. He was the last recorded white tiger born in the wild. The last white tiger seen in the wild was shot in 1958 in the Hazaribagh forests of Bihar.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt; There have been rumors of white tigers in Hazaribagh, the Tora forsts of Rewa, and [[Kanha National Park]] since 1958, but these were not considered credible by K.S. Sankhala. A photograph of Mohan's stuffed head, in a display case in the private museum of the Maharaja of Rewa in Govindgarh Lake Palace, appears in the National Geographic book "The Year Of The Tiger."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Michael &amp; Ward, Geoffrey C., The Year Of The Tiger, National Geographic Society 1998 pg. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Another picture of Mohan's head appears on the official website of the Maharaja of Rewa (MP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharajrewa.com/ Official website of the Maharaja of Rewa (M.P.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maharaja of Rewa turned Mohan's native forest into the [[Bandhavgarh National Park]], because he could not control the poaching. The Maharaja was negotiating the sale of a white male, named Virat, as late as 1976, when he died of [[enteritis]]. Virat was a son of Mohan and Sukeshi.

At Bandhavgarh visitors can stay at the White Tiger Lodge, which is the local version of Tiger Tops in Royal Chitwan in [[Nepal]]. Pushpraj Singh, the reigning Maharaja of Rewa, has asked students to sign a petition to ask the [[President of India]] to return at least two white tigers to Govindgarh Lake Palace, as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;"MP students want white tiger back in its homeland", Hindustan Times, December 1, 2007 http://hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=b274835b-1b55-403a-83f2-2eea243ae05d&amp;&amp;Headline=Indian+&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohini Rewa (Enchantress) and Sampson==
'''Mohini''', a daughter of Mohan, was officially presented to President Eisenhower by John W. Kluge, in a ceremony at the [[White House]] on December 5, 1960, and went to live at the Lion House, in the National Zoo, in [[Rock Creek Park]].&lt;ref&gt;This Day In Smithsonian History-December   http://www.siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/thisday/december.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Zoo to Get White Tiger" The Christian Science Monitor Oct. 22, 1960 pgs. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White Tiger To Meet Ike On Monday, The Washington Post Dec. 3, 1960 pg. A 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rare Beast from India, The Chicago Tribune Dec. 1, 1960 pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for The New York Times described the meeting of Mohini and President Eisenhower: "The President shied noticeably when the beast roared and leaped in his direction inside the traveling cage drawn up on the White House south driveway. An eloquent "Well!" was the President's only comment for the next few seconds."&lt;ref&gt;"Eisenhower Is Wary as He meets a 'White Tiger'" New York Times Dec. 6, 1960 pg. 47 L+&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazak, Vratislav (Czech taxonomist), Der Tiger, Wittenberg Lutherstadt: Ziemensen, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; T.H. Reed, the director of the National Zoo, gave this description of Mohini: "Her stripes were black, shading into brown, but her main coat was eggshell white instead of the normal rufous orange. Exotic coloring and magnificent physique made her a tiger without peer. For a two-year-old kitten she had tremendous growth-almost 190 pounds, three feet tall at the shoulders, and eight feet from nose to tail."&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; White tigers are larger and heavier than regular orange tigers. The average length of a white tiger at birth is 53&amp;nbsp;cm, compared to 50&amp;nbsp;cm for a normal orange cub. Shoulder height is 17&amp;nbsp;cm (normal 12&amp;nbsp;cm), weight 1.37&amp;nbsp;kg (normal 1.25&amp;nbsp;kg). Dalip and Krishna, two white tigers at New Delhi Zoo, weighed 139&amp;nbsp;kg and 120&amp;nbsp;kg respectively, at two years of age. Ram and Jim, two normal colored tigers at the same zoo, weighed 106&amp;nbsp;kg and 119&amp;nbsp;kg, at the same age. Raja, the white tiger, had a shoulder height of 100&amp;nbsp;cm, at ten years of age, while Suraj, an orange tiger, had a shoulder height of only 90&amp;nbsp;cm, at 12 years of age, according to New Delhi Zoo director K.S. Sankhala. Ratna and Vindhya, orange tigresses "from the white race", who carried the white gene as a recessive (both were fathered by Mohan), were higher at the shoulder than average, measuring 87 and 88&amp;nbsp;cm, compared to a normal orange tigress named Asharfi, who measured 82&amp;nbsp;cm at the shoulder.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt; White tigers also grow faster than orange tigers.&lt;ref&gt;Leyhausen, Paul &amp; Reed, Theodore H., White tiger care and breeding of a genetic freak, Smithsonian April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; This would have given them an advantage in the wild.

Following Mohini's arrival in New York City from India, with National Zoo director T.H.

She was her father's namesake. She was a great attraction, and the zoo wanted to breed more white tigers. At the time, no more white tigers were being allowed out of India, so Mohini was mated to Sampson, her uncle and half brother, who was sent from Ahmedabad Zoo in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Crandall, Lee S., The management of wild mammals in captivity, University of Chicago Press 1964&lt;/ref&gt; (It seems probable that financial considerations may have also precluded Washington from acquiring a second white tiger as a mate for Mohini.) Sampson was donated to the National Zoo by Ralph S. Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Samson Arrives at Washington Zoo, The Washington Post Jan. 6, 1963 pg. A3&lt;/ref&gt; Mohini was originally betrothed to an orange Bengal tiger named "Mighty Mo", who was captured in Central India in the forests of the Maharaja of [[Panna, Madhya Pradesh|Panna]] by Ralph S. Scott, and donated to the National Zoo on June 19, 1959. Today there is a [[Panna National Park]]. Unfortunately Mohini used to push Mighty Mo around. The original plan was to breed Mohini with an unrelated orange tiger, and then breed her to one or more of her male offspring, in the hope of producing white cubs. That was before Sampson arrived. Sampson fathered the first two of Mohini's four litters, which were born in 1964 and 1966. Mighty Mo and another tiger named "Foa" were given to the Pittsburgh Zoo in August 1966.

After Sampson's death in 1966, at age 11 of [[Renal failure|kidney failure]], Mohini was bred to her son Ramana, who was then the only male white gene carrier available. This resulted in the birth of a white daughter named '''Rewati''' on April 13, 1969&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Elizabeth C., "White Tiger In My House". National Geographic May 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and a white son named '''Moni''' on Feb. 8, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Rare Tigers Born at Zoo: Rare White Tigers Born at Zoo, The Washington Post March 10, 1970 pg.

He was born in a litter of five, which included two white males and three orange females. One was stillborn and the mother crushed the others after three days. When Moni was a cub he was photographed with Mrs. Suharto, the wife of Indonesian President [[Suharto]], when she visited the National Zoo. Rewati had an orange male [[littermate]] which died after two days. Ramana was born on July 1, 1964 and had two litter mates-a white male named Rajkumar, who was the first white tiger born in a zoo, and an orange female named Ramani.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Phil, Being a White Tiger no Problem For Mohini's Five-Week-Old-Cub, The Washington Post Feb. 14, 1964 pg.

All of Mohini's cubs were named by the Indian Ambassador. At the time of his death, at only ten months of age, Rajkumar already weighed 175 pounds, and could hardly be called a cub. He was first named "Charlie" by one of his keepers, before the Indian Ambassador gave him his official name. The National Zoo planned to trade Rajkumar for a number of other animals. He was equal to ten zebras in value. The Smithsonian Institution stepped in and vetoed the plan, insisting that Rajkumar would remain a permanent resident of Washington D.C. Rajkumar was the only white tiger fathered by Sampson.

The birth of Mohini's first litter was televised in a national special. Mohini's orange daughter Kesari was born in 1966 with an orange female who was stillborn. It was even suggested, although probably not too seriously, that Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] be asked to bring a white tiger cub for the zoo, when she was scheduled to visit Washington in 1966. After Moni died in 1971 the National Zoo tried to acquire an orange tiger named Ram from [[Trivandrum]] Zoo, in southern India, as a mate for Mohini.&lt;ref&gt;"Death of white tiger" Washington Post July 9, 1971 pgs. B1, B5&lt;/ref&gt; Ram was her first cousin, a grandson of Mohan, and there was a 50% chance that he carried white genes. 25% of Ram's genes came from Mohan and 25% from Begum. 25% of Mohini's genes were from Begum and 75% from Mohan. Ram was a son of Vindhya and Suraj born on 23 IV 1965 at New Delhi Zoo, the same Ram discussed earlier. Two sisters of Ram, born on 22 Feb. 1967, went to the [[Romanshorn]] Zoo in [[Switzerland]]. In 1973 an [[Indochinese tiger]] (''Panthera tigris corbetti'') named Poona, who was born at the [[Woodland Park Zoo]] in [[Seattle]] in 1962, was sent to Washington on a six-month breeding loan from the [[Brookfield Zoo]] and bred to Mohini&lt;ref&gt;"20 year old Mohini Rewa put to death at National Zoo" The Washington Post April 3, 1979 pg. B1&lt;/ref&gt; and Kesari.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, D.G., 1974 Estrous cycles and behavior of captive tigers. In: The World's Cats (Ed. by R.L. Eaton), pp. 60–75. Seattle, Woodland Park Zoo.&lt;/ref&gt; (Poona would have been regarded as a Bengal tiger for the first two years of his life because the Indo-Chinese subspecies was not recognized until 1968.) Mohini did not conceive. Kesari produced six orange cubs, an extraordinary number, especially for a first litter, but only one survived, a female named Marvina. Kesari handed Marvina over to her keepers and kept the other five. Marvina was mistaken for male, and named Marvin which was changed to Marvina when it was discovered that he was a she. Washington Zoo keeper Art Cooper, who hand reared Marvina, observed that white tigers were the most obstinate cats in the zoo, and said that Marvina had a typical white tiger personality.&lt;ref&gt;"A Zoo for all seasons: the Smithsonian animal world"/Alfred Meyer, editor; writers, Thomas Crosby...et al., Washington D.C. Smithsonian Exposition Book; New York: distributed by Norton, c 1979,&lt;/ref&gt; (Poona also fathered litters by two other tigresses in Brookfield.) In 1974 Marvina, Ramana, and Kesari were sent to the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]], and Rewati and Mohini went to the Brookfield Zoo, to be boarded during renovations in Washington, until 1976.
As a fringe benefit of inbreeding the four cubs were pure-Bengal tigers, and they were the last registered Bengal tigers born in the United States. Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, Peela, and Rewati had inbreeding coefficients of 0.406.&lt;ref&gt;Goebel, Anna M. &amp; Whitmore, H. Donald, "Use of Electrophoretic Data in the Reevaluation of Tiger Systematics" Tigers Of The World The Biology, Biopolitics, Management And Conservation Of An Endangered Species, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987 pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Ramana died in 1974 of a kidney infection and became a father for the last time posthumously.

A white half sister of Mohini's, bred from Mohan and Sukishi, born on March 26, 1966, named Gomti&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; and later renamed Princess, lived in the Crandon Park Zoo in Miami for almost three years, before she died of a viral infection at age five in December 1970.&lt;ref name="international1977"/&gt; She arrived in Miami on January 13, 1968.
Miami mayor Chuck Hall met the 22-month-old 350&amp;nbsp;lbs. white tigress at the airport and rode with her to the zoo. He wanted to call her Maya, the name suggested by the Maharaja, which translates as Princess. Ralph S. Scott, who paid $35,000 for her and gave her to the Zoological Society of Florida, preferred the name Princess.&lt;ref name="international1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruning, Fred, "Hall Has A White Tiger By The Handle" The Miami Herald Jan. 14, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Is A Tiger" The Miami Herald Jan. 19, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The Zoological Society of Florida loaned Princess to the Crandon Park Zoo. It was Ralph S. Scott, a famous big game hunter, who suggested to John W. Kluge that he buy a white tiger for the children of America. He had seen the white tigers in Govindgarh Palace while tiger hunting in India.&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; The government of India wanted Princess to be the last white tiger exported from the country. A male white tiger, named Ravi, acquired by Ralph S. Scott for the Crandon Park Zoo died at [[Kanpur]] railway station en route from India in 1967. He was a son of Raja and Rani born in New Delhi Zoo, and sold by the Maharaja of Rewa. In 1970 [[Jimmy Stewart]] was on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and said that his wife was going to buy a white tiger from the Maharaja of Rewa for the Los Angeles Zoo. Ralph S. Scott was watching and felt as though he was being robbed. He had been trying to get a mate for Princess for years. A bidding war erupted between Scott, Jimmy Stewart, a major league baseball team, a Hollywood producer, and a major European zoo. Scott said of Princess "It is cruel to expect an animal like that to live alone. And you can't mate her with an ordinary tiger-she's so superior...I appealed to the Maharaja from a conservation standpoint and it hit home." Princess and Rajah were to be a "royal couple." The Los Angeles Zoo had already spent $20,000 building a white tiger exhibit. Scott said that he would try and send them a pair of cubs from Princess and Rajah, but Princess died a week before Rajah was scheduled to arrive. Scott hired an Indian taxidermist to stuff Princess, and she was presented to the Museum of Science in Miami in 1972, but she is now in the reception area of the Miami MetroZoo's administration building. Scott paid around $45,000 for Raja, who he thought might still be mated to Mohini, but Rajah never arrived in Crandon Park. Scott was so respected as a tiger hunter that he was asked to deal with man eaters which were terrorizing villages. He was a hunter turned conservationist, and a cat-lover.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Ian, Miami News, Crandon Park coup: a new white tiger, Dec. 10, 1970; White Tiger Donor Snaps Up A Mate (Before Bigmouth) Dec. 11, 1970; Autopsy still incomplete, Viral infection killeed Crandon's white tiger, Dec. 18, 1970; Dangaard, Colin, Miami's White Tiger Dies A Week Before Wedding, Miami Herald, Dec. 17, 1970; Princess's Ghost, Miami Herald, May 4, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  Mohini died in 1979.&lt;ref name="smithsonian1979"&gt;Park, Edwards, Around The Mall And Beyond, Smithsonian Sept. 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The skins and skulls of Mohini and Moni are in the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but are not on display.

An orange brother of Mohini's named Ramesh lived in the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes]] (Paris Zoo), and was bred to an unrelated tigress, but none of the offspring survived to reproduce. Ramesh was born in Govindgarh Palace and had an orange female littermate, named Ratna who went to New Delhi Zoo, and a white male littermate named Ramu.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; They were the fourth and last litter of Mohan and Radha. Ratna was paired with a wild caught male named Jim, at New Delhi Zoo, and produced three litters. Each cub would have had a 50% chance of inheriting the white gene from Ratna. Jim was captured in the Rewa forest, so they thought there was a chance he carried white genes. He had been somebody's pet, but after he ate a cat he was given to New Delhi Zoo. Jim used to appear leaping into his pond, at New Delhi Zoo, in the opening of one of [[Gerald Durrell]]'s TV shows. [[Edward Pritchard Gee]] mentioned, in his book "The Wildlife Of India" (which has a foreword by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]), that Bristol Zoo wanted to acquire one of the cubs of Mohan and Begum, as a mate for one of its white tigers, Champak or Chameli, to lessen the degree of inbreeding, as the US National Zoo had done with Sampson.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, Edward Pritchard. The wild life of India; with a foreword by Jawaharlal Nehru, London: Collins, 1964 {{ISBN|0-00-211910-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-00-211910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bristol Zoo did acquire one of the daughters of Mohan and Begum.&lt;ref&gt;Schomberg, Geoffrey, The Penguin guide to British zoos, Harmondsworth, Penguin 1970 {{ISBN|0-14-046154-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, and Peela were sold to the International Animal Exchange. Ranjit, Priya, and Peela went to the IAE's facility in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]]. The phenomenon of spontaneous [[ovulation]] in a tiger was first observed by Devra Kleiman, in one of the white tigresses at the National Zoo, which meant that it was possible to breed tigers by [[artificial insemination]].
Mohini died in 1979 at 20 years of age. Edwards Park wrote in Smithsonian magazine that National Zoo director Ted Reed was "mourning his queen the late Mohini Rewa." Ted Reed said "It's impossible to say how much the zoo owes that cat and her cubs. They drew attention to the facility and made all of our recent improvements so much easier. If she had been human she would have been a movie star."&lt;ref name="smithsonian1979"/&gt;

==Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty: A new strain==
'''Tony''', born in July 1972 in the [[Terrell Jacobs Circus Winter Quarters|Circus Winter Quarters of the Cole Bros. Circus]] (the Terrell Jacobs farm) in [[Peru, Indiana]], was the founder of many American white tiger lines, especially those used in circuses.&lt;ref name="illustrated1986"&gt;Geringer, Dan, "Now He's The Cat's Meow" Sports Illustrated Vol. 65 No. 3 July 21, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was a registered Siberian tiger, named Kubla, who was born at the [[Como Park, Zoo, and Conservatory]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Edythe Records, The tigers of Como Zoo, New York: Viking Press 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siberian tiger cubs born at Como Zoo, The New York Times July 23, 1958 pg. 40:2&lt;/ref&gt; Kubla's parents were born in the wild and believed to be brother and sister. Kubla was bred to a Bengal tigress named Susie, from a west coast zoo, at the Great Plains Zoo in  [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]] in [[South Dakota]]. She was once co-owned by [[Clyde Beatty]]. Between April 10, 1966 and August 3, 1969 Kubla and Susie produced 13 or 14 cubs in 5 or 6 litters. The cubs were widely distributed. One eventually reached Paris, and another went from the [[Utica Zoo]] in [[New York State]] to Japan. Two of their cubs (Rajah and Sheba II) were bred by Baron Julius Von Uhl, who lived in Peru, Indiana. Julius Von Uhl was born in [[Budapest]] and came to America in 1956 from [[Hungary]] after the revolution. One of the results of his tiger breeding was Tony, who therefore carried mixed blood&lt;ref&gt;Van Nostrand, Mary L., "Mohan The Ghost Tiger Of Rewa" Zoonooz May 1984 pgs. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been the source of a gene for stripelessness. Kubla was also bred to an Amur tigress named Katrina, who was born at the [[Rotterdam]] Zoo, and passed through the hands of two American zoos before joining Kubla and Susie at the Great Plains Zoo. Kubla and Katrina have living pure-Amur descendants which may include a line of white tigers, that are claimed as pure-Amurs, which originated out of [[Center Hill, Florida]]. These white tigers are not registered Amur tigers. A tiger trainer named Alan Gold owned a pair of Amur tigers which once produced a stillborn white cub.

In 1972 there were four white tigers in the United States: Mohini and her daughter Rewati in Washington D.C., Tony, and his first cousin  named [[Bagheera]], a female born on July 8, 1972 in a litter of two white cubs, including a male which did not survive, in the Hawthorn Circus of John F. Cuneo Jr. Bagheera's mother, Sheba III, was a sister of Tony's mother, Sheba II. Bagheera's father was either an Amur tiger, named Ural, who was her preferred mate, and may have been her uncle and a littermate, or younger sibling, of Kubla, born at the Como Zoo; or one of two of her brothers, named Prince and Saber, who were also brothers to Tony's parents.&lt;ref name="Thornton2"&gt;Thornton, I.W.B. 1978. White tiger genetics-further evidence. J. Zool. 185:389–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Sheba III's litters did not include white cubs, but at least 50% of her orange cubs would have been white gene carriers, since they could have inherited the gene from their mother, and if both parents were heterozygotes 66%, or two out of three, of their orange cubs are likely to have been carriers. She had 27 cubs in 9 litters between July 8, 1972 and July 26, 1975, of which only 3 were white, or 11%, not 25% as would be expected if both parents in each mating were heterozygotes.  Prince was [[Castration|castrated]] before Sheba III conceived another white cub, a male named Frosty, born on Feb. 25, 1975, in a litter which included two orange females and one orange male.&lt;ref name="Thornton2"/&gt; It seems odd that a tiger which may have been fathering such valuable cubs (Prince) would have been neutered. Saber was never observed trying to mate, so perhaps Ural did sire one or more of Sheba III's white cubs, which would have been three quarters [[Siberian tiger|Siberian]] had this been the case. It is possible for tigers from the same litter to have different fathers. It's also possible that any or all three tigers-Ural, Prince, and Saber, carried the white gene. Ural was a sad specimen. He was cross eyed, although he was not white. Bagheera and Frosty were both severely cross eyed.

Tony was purchased by John F. Cuneo Jr., owner of the Hawthorn Circus Corp. of [[Grayslake, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;"Grrr! Ownership of rare white tiger disputed" The Detroit News Feb. 11, 1975 Section A. pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiger's Sale O.K.ed For Extra $4000, The Detroit News Feb. 14, 1975 Section A. pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  in February 1975 for $20,000 in Detroit. Tony's parents, Raja and Sheba, produced two more white cubs at the Baltimore County Fair on June 27, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"Rare tigers born at fair", N.Y. Times June 28, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The cubs were a white male, named "Baltimore County Fair", a white female named "Snowball", and an orange male. National Zoo spokeswoman Sybille Hamlem said: "This could be a real bonus for the breed if the two stay in the United States. The white tigers are no longer found in the wild and there have been genetic problems because of inbreeding. But that's apparently not the case here."&lt;ref&gt;"2 tiger cubs, rare Siberian, born at fair", The Baltimore Sun, Monday June 28, 1976 pg. C.1&lt;/ref&gt; Snowball's name was later changed to "Maharani", and all three cubs were sold to the [[Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. Maharani died in 1984. Baron Julius Von Uhl had another three white cubs born between June 18 and 19, 1977 at Kingdom's 3 (formerly [[Lion Country Safari]]) at [[Stockbridge, Georgia|Stockbridge]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] off I-75 south of [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Rare White Tigers Born, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Sunday June 19, 1977 pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Two lived only a short time. The other, named Scarlett O'Hara, died at the Grady Memorial Hospital's animal research clinic in Atlanta, on Jan. 30, 1978, of cardiac arrest resulting from anaesthesia. She was there to undergo surgery to correct crossed eyes. (She was only cross eyed in the right eye, which turned inward toward the nose.) She was still owned by Julius Von Uhl at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Ron, Scarlett O'Hara Sets Sights On Grady, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Wednes.

However, Tony and Rewati did not breed, so he was bred to Mohini's orange daughter Kesari instead, resulting in a litter of four white and one orange cub June 27, 1976, the same day that eight-year-old Sheba had her white cubs in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. It is an astounding coincidence that both tigresses gave birth to white cubs on exactly the same day. On that one day America's white tiger population nearly doubled from 8 to 14. Kesari's 1976 litter represented a mixture of the two unrelated strains.

All of the white cubs from Kesari's 1976 litter by Tony were cross-eyed, as were Rewati, Bagheera, and Frosty. The Cincinnati Zoo retained a brother and sister pair from the litter, named Bhim and Sumita, and their orange sister Kamala. Two white males returned to the Hawthorn Circus with Tony as John Cuneo's share from the breeding loan. John Cuneo also asked the Bristol Zoo to trade some white tigers, to diversify the gene pool, but the Bristol Zoo declined, perhaps not wishing to exchange pure-Bengals for mongrels. Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty lived for years with a troop of Hawthorn Circus tigers stationed at [[Marineland (Ontario)|Marineland and Game Farm]], in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Because of selective breeding only a few of the oldest white tigers in the Hawthorn Circus today are [[Strabismus|cross eyed]]. Bhim and Sumita became the world record parents of white cubs. In 1976 there were 39 white tigers-7 in New Delhi, 7 in Kolkata, one in [[Guwahati]], one in [[Lucknow]], one in [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], 8 in [[Bristol]], Cincinnati Zoo had 2, Washington had 5, John Cuneo had 5, and Julius Von Uhl had 2. The Maharaja of Rewa retired from the white tiger business in 1976. He later abdicated in favor of his son so that he could run for the family seat in parliament and became an MP. There is a white tiger cub on the shield of the coat of arms of the Maharajas of Rewa.

Over 70 white tigers have been born at the Cincinnati Zoo, which is no longer in the white tiger business. The Cincinnati Zoo sold white tigers&lt;ref&gt;White Bengal tiger imported for Longleat Safari Park, The Times March 22, 1989 pg. 3d&lt;/ref&gt; for $60,000 each. Siegfried &amp; Roy bought a litter of three white cubs from the Cincinnati Zoo, which were offspring of Bhim and Sumita, for around $125,000. Prior to 1974 the Cincinnati Zoo wanted to acquire a white tiger, but no zoo would sell at any price. By the 1980s the Cincinnati Zoo was the world's leading purveyor of white tigers. It was a cousin of the Maharaja of Rewa, Lt. Col. Fatesinghrao "Jackie" Gaekwad, the Maharaja of Baroda, who was also the Commissioner of Indian Wildlife and an MP, who suggested to Siegfried and Roy that they acquire white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo and include them in their act.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fischbacher, Siegfried; Horn, Roy Uwe Ludwig, &amp; Tapert, Annette, Siegfried and Roy: mastering the impossible, New York: W. Morrow, c 1992&lt;/ref&gt;"Jackie" was also the President of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] India.  In the mid 1980s Siegfried &amp; Roy owned 10% of the world's white tigers, and they were escorting two big white tiger cubs, with dark stripes, to their new home in [[Phantasialand]] in [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Brühl]], [[Germany]], when the white tigers were briefly stolen with their truck in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;thieves abandon stolen truck containing 2 white tiger cub(s) The Washington Post, June 5, 1987 pg. A 13b&lt;/ref&gt; The driver stopped for coffee. The white tigers made their debut in Germany at a ceremony attended by the United States Ambassador.

The [[Henry Doorly Zoo]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] bought Tony's parents and orange sister Obie (born in 1975) in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Lee G., White Tigers The realities, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and bred more white tigers. Kesari also went to live at [[Omaha]] Zoo, but did not have any more cubs. Some of Tony's white siblings born in Omaha proved to be sterile. Obie was paired with Ranjit from the National Zoo, and their cubs like those of Tony and Kesari, included non inbred white tigers.

His brother, Panghur Ban, was the National Zoo's last white tiger.&lt;ref&gt;National Zoo's only white tiger euthanized https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-10-02-white-tiger-dies_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A white tiger named Rajiv, a son of Bhim, became the first white tiger in [[Africa]], when he was sent to Pretoria Zoo in exchange for a [[Cheetah#King cheetah|king cheetah]].&lt;ref&gt;"First White Tiger In Africa" &amp; "How To Breed A White Tiger" Zoon No. 29, 1988–4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Rewati was paired with Ika, from Kesari's 1976 litter, at the Columbus Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;"Rewati" Columbus ZooViews Autumn 1981&lt;/ref&gt; By this time he was a three legged amputee retired from circus performance, put out to pasture to breed. Ika killed Rewati in the act of mating.&lt;ref&gt;"D.C. born white tiger killed by mate in Columbus (Ohio) zoo" Washington Post April 8, 1983 pg. B3&lt;/ref&gt; Ika was then mated with a white tigress named Taj, who was a grand daughter of his brothers Ranjit and Bhim. Ika was also bred to Taj's orange mother Dolly, a daughter of Bhim and an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi, in Columbus. Taj's father, Duke, was a son of Ranjit from an outcross to an unrelated orange tigress. Isson, a white grandson of Kesari and Tony, was also dispatched to Columbus on breeding loan from the Hawthorn Circus, of Grayslake, Illinois, which eventually had 80 white tigers, the largest collection in the world at the time. In 1984 five white tiger cubs were stolen from the Hawthorn Circus in Portland, Oregon, and two died. The tigers were touring with the [[Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]]. The culprit was a veterinarian who was sentenced to one year in prison and six months in a halfway house. Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska testified in the case that the five white cubs had a dollar value in excess of $5000.&lt;ref&gt;"Verdict upheld in cubs case"The Baton Rouge Advocate, Nov. 16, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/old/F2/804.F2d.-3012html ]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 a white cub was born in the [[Racine Zoological Gardens]] in [[Wisconsin]], from a father-daughter mating. The father, named Bucky, killed the white cub. The mother, named Bonnie, was later bred with an orange littermate of Tony named "Chequila", who belonged to James Witchey of [[Ravenna, Ohio]], who bought him from Dick Hartman of [[South Lebanon, Ohio]], when he was four or five years of age. Chequila proved to be a white gene carrier and fathered at least one white cub in the Racine Zoo in 1980. It is not known whether Bucky, who came from the [[Fort Wayne Children's Zoo]] in [[Indiana]], and his daughter Bonnie, were related to any of the established strains of white tigers, but it is possible that Bucky was another one of the cubs of Kubla and Susie, born in Sioux Falls. By 1987 10% of North American zoo tigers were white.

==The Orissa strain==
Three white tigers were also born in the [[Nandankanan Zoo]] in [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Orissa, India]] in 1980. Their parents were an orange father–daughter pair called Deepak and Ganga, who were not related to Mohan or any other captive white tiger – one of their wild-caught ancestors would have carried the recessive white gene, and it showed up when Deepak was mated to his daughter. Deepak's sister also turned out to be a white gene carrier. These white tigers are therefore referred to as the Orissa strain, as opposed to the Rewa strain, of white tigers founded by Mohan.&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., Chapter 34 "White Tigers And Their Conservation", Part IV "White Tiger Politics", Tigers Of The World, The Biology, Biopolitics, Management And Conservation Of An Endangered Species, Noyes Publications, Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., &amp; L.N. Acharjyo. 1983. Origin of white tigers at Nandankanan Biological Park, Orissa. Indian J. Exper. Biol. 21:350-52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., A Genetic Analysis Of The White Tigers In The Nandankanan Bio Park, Orissa, 1990 Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury A.K.

When the surprise birth of three white cubs occurred there was a white tigress already living at the zoo, named Diana, from New Delhi Zoo. One of the three was later bred to her creating another blend of two unrelated strains of white tigers. This lineage resulted in several white tigers in Nandan Kanan Zoo. Today the Nandankanan Zoo has the largest collection of white tigers in India. The Cincinnati Zoo acquired two female white tigers from the Nandan Kanan Zoo, in the hopes of establishing a line of pure-Bengal white tigers in America, but they never got a male, and did not receive authorization from the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA)'s [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) to breed them. The Zoo Outreach Organisation used to publish studbooks for white tigers, which were compiled by A.K. Roychoudhury of the [[Bose Institute]] in Calcutta, and subsidized by the Humane Society of India.&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury A.K. 1989 About studbook of white tigers in India. Zoos' Print Journal 4:8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbus Zoo had also hoped to breed pure-Bengal white tigers, but were unable to obtain a white registered Bengal mate for Rewati from India.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, David A., &amp; Kohl, Steven G., Developing International Conservation Programs, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also surprise births of white tigers in the Asian Circus, in India, to parents not known to have been white gene carriers, or heterozygotes, and not known to have any relationship to any other white tiger strains. There was a female white cub born at [[Mysore Zoo]] in 1984, from orange parents, descended from Deepak's sister. The white cub's grandmother Thara came from the Nandankanan Zoo in 1972. Mysore Zoo had a second female white tiger cub from New Delhi Zoo in 1984. On August 29, 1979 a white tigress named Seema was dispatched to [[Kanpur]] Zoo to be bred to Badal, a tiger who was a fourth generation descendant of Mohan and Begum. The pair did not breed so it was decided to pair Seema with one of two wild caught, notorious man eaters, either Sheru or Titu, from the [[Jim Corbett National Park]]. Seema and Sheru produced a white cub, and for a while it was thought there might be white genes in Corbett's population of tigers, but the cub did not stay white.&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., The Indian White Tiger Studbook, Zoo Zen, International Zoo Outreach Org., Tamil Nadu, India 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The White Bengal Tiger http://www.518.ips12.in.us/CamsPhotos/Tigers/3518.aspx.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoo Dynamics {{cite web |url=http://www.zoopros.com/zd_016.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227035351/http://zoopros.com/zd_016.htm |archivedate=2010-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other cases of white tiger, [[white lion]], and [[white panther]] cubs being born, and then changing to normal color. White tigers which were a mixture of the Rewa and Orissa strains, born at the Nandan Kanan Zoo, were non inbred. A white tiger from out of the Orissa strain found its way to the [[Western Plains Zoo]] in [[Australia]]. Australia's [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], wanted to breed this tiger to one of their white tigers from the United States.

[[File:Stieler,_Joseph_Karl_-_Alexander_von_Humboldt_-_1843.jpg|thumb|''Humboldt and his Kosmos'' (1843), [[Joseph Karl Stieler]]]]
'''''Cosmos''''' (in German ''Kosmos – Entwurf einer physischen Weltbeschreibung'') is an influential [[treatise]] on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. ''Cosmos'' began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the [[University of Berlin]], and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and completed based on Humboldt's notes). In the first volume of ''Cosmos'', Humboldt paints a general “portrait of nature”, describing the physical nature of outer space and the earth. In the second volume he describes the [[history of science]].&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Widely read by academics and laymen alike, it applied the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] view of the orderliness of the [[cosmos]] (the [[harmony]] of the [[universe]]) to the Earth, suggesting that universal laws applied as well to the apparent chaos of the terrestrial world. Humboldt goes on to suggest that when one contemplates the beauty of the cosmos, one can obtain personal inspiration and a beneficial, if subjective, awareness about life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=L. D.|title=Introducing Humboldt’s Cosmos|journal=Minding Nature|volume=August|year=2009|pages=3–15|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cosmos'' was influenced by Humboldt’s various travels and studies, but mainly by his journey throughout the Americas. As he wrote, “it was the discovery of America that planted the seed of the Cosmos.”&lt;ref name="Walls"&gt;Laura Dassow Walls, ''The Passage to Cosmos: Alexander von Humboldt and the Shaping of America'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to all of his experience in the field, Humboldt was preeminently qualified for the task to represent the universe in a single work.&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;Robert B. Downs, ''Landmarks in Science: Hippocrates to Carson'' (Littleton, Colo: Libraries Unlimited, 1982), 189-191.&lt;/ref&gt; He had extensive knowledge of many fields of learning, varied experiences as a traveler, and the resources of the scientific and literary world at his disposal.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

''Cosmos'' was highly popular when it was released, with the first volume selling out in two months, and the work translated into most European languages.&lt;ref name="Botting"&gt;Douglas Botting, ''Humboldt and the Cosmos'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973), 258-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the  [[natural science]]s have diverged from the romantic perspective Humboldt presented in  ''Cosmos'', the work is still considered to be a substantial scientific and literary achievement, having influenced subsequent scientific progress and imparted a unifying perspective to the studies of science, nature, and mankind.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

==Background and influences==

Since the early years of the nineteenth century, Humboldt had been a world-famous figure, second in renown only to Napoleon. As the son of an aristocratic family in Prussia, he received the best education available at the time in Europe, studying under famous thinkers at the universities of Frankfurt and Göttingen. By the time he wrote ''Cosmos'', Humboldt was an esteemed explorer, cosmographer, biologist, diplomat, engineer, and citizen of the world.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; While considered a geographer, he is accredited with contributing to most of the sciences of the natural world environment found today.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Jeff Lee, ''Alexander von Humboldt'' (New York: American Geographical Society, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A portrait of Humboldt by Friedrich Georg Weitsch, 1806]]

===Humboldt in the Americas===

Probably more than any other factor, Humboldt's career was shaped by his travels in South and Central America in the five years from 1799 to 1804.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Humboldt said that his Cosmos was born on the slopes of the Andes.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Beginning in Venezuela, he explored the Orinoco and upper Amazon valleys, climbed Mount Chimborazo — then believed to be the world's highest mountain — investigated changing vegetation from the tropical jungles to the top of the Andes, collected thousands of plant specimens, and accumulated a vast collection of animals, insects, and geological fragments.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; From the notes he gathered on this journey, Humboldt was able to produce at least thirty volumes based on his observations.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; His studies related to many scientific fields, including botany, zoology, geology, and geography, as well as narratives of popular travel and discussions of political, economic, and social conditions.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

===Humboldt in Asia===

Twenty-five years after his exploration of the Americas, at the age of sixty, Humboldt undertook an extended tour, subsidized by the Tsar of Russia, into the interior of Asia.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Between May and November 1829, Humboldt and his two subordinates, C.G. Ehrenberg and Gustav Rose, traveled across the vast expanse of the Russian empire. Upon his return, Humboldt left the publication of the scientific results to Ehrenberg and Rose, while his own work — a three-volume descriptive geography entitles ''Asie Centrale'' — did not appear until many years later. This work was very modest in comparison to Humboldt's South American publications. ''Asie Centrale'' focused on the facts and figures of Central Asian geography, along with data to complete his isothermal world map.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; It was during his South American and Asian explorations that Humboldt made the observations crucial to forming his physical description of the universe in ''Cosmos''.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

===Berlin lectures===

In 1827, having spent himself into poverty publishing his scientific works, his king, Friedrich Wilhelm III, reminded Humboldt of his debt and recalled him to Berlin. When he arrived in Berlin, Humboldt announced that he would give a course of lectures on physical geography. From November 1827 to April 1828, he delivered a series of sixty-one lectures at the University of Berlin. The lectures were so well-attended, that Humboldt soon announced a second series, which was held in a music hall before an audience of thousands, free to all comers.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Beginning in 1828, Humboldt finally gave expression to his concept in his Berlin lectures, and from then on he labored to produce his physical description of the universe in book form.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; Collaborators pledged to his assistance included the greatest scientists of his generation, including leaders in chemistry, astronomy, anatomy, mathematics, mineralogy, botany, and other areas of study.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

==Publication==

In 1828 after the Berlin lectures, Humboldt began formulating his vision in writing. His factual text, heavily loaded with footnotes and references, was sent in proof sheets to all the various specialists for comments and corrections before publication. In this way, he aimed to ensure that what he wrote was both accurate and up-to-date. He continually looked to his friend and literary advisor Varnhagen von Ense for advice in the matter of his style of writing.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; In total ''Cosmos'' took twenty-five years to write.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

[[File:Cosmos kaulbach 215.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A portrait of Humboldt greeting death, by Wilhelm von Kaulbach, 1869]] Humboldt felt as if publishing ''Cosmos'' was a race against death. The first volume was published in 1845 when he was seventy-six, the second when he was seventy-eight, the third when he was eighty-one, and the fourth when he was eighty-nine. The fifth volume, however, was only half-written when Humboldt died in 1859 and had to be completed from his notes and provided with an index over a thousand pages long.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

==Content==

Humboldt viewed the world as what the ancient Greeks called a kosmos – “a beautifully ordered and harmonious system” – and coined the modern word “cosmos” to use as the title of his final work.&lt;ref name="Aaron"&gt;Aaron Sachs, "The Humboldt Current: Nineteenth-Century Exploration and the Roots of American Environmentalism." (New York: Viking, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This title allowed him to encompass heaven and earth together.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; He reintroduced Cosmos as “the assemblage of all things in heaven and earth, the universality of created things constituting the perceptible world.”&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Cosmos'' (George Bell, 1883) 1:24.&lt;/ref&gt; His basic purpose is outlined in the introduction to the first volume:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The most important aim of all physical science is this: to recognize unity in diversity, to comprehend all the single aspects as revealed by the discoveries of the last epochs, to judge single phenomena separately without surrendering their bulk, and to grasp Nature's essence under the cover of outer appearances."&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Humboldt soon adds that Cosmos signifies both the “order of the world, and adornment of this universal order.”&lt;ref name="Cosmos"/&gt; Thus, there are two aspects of the Cosmos, the “order” and the “adornment.” The first refers to the observed fact that the physical universe, independently of humans, demonstrates regularities and patterns that we can define as laws.  Adornment, however, is up to human interpretation. To Humboldt, Cosmos is both ordered and beautiful, through the human mind.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; He created a dynamic picture of the universe that would continually grow and change as human conceptions of nature and the depth of human feeling about nature enlarge and deepen.

To represent this double-sided aspect of Cosmos, Humboldt divided his book into two parts, with the first painting a general “portrait of nature.”&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Humboldt first examines outer space – the Milky Way, cosmic nebulae, and planets – and then proceeds to the earth and its physical geography; climate; volcanoes; relationships among plants, animals, and mankind; evolution; and the beauty of nature. In the second part, on the history of science, Humboldt aims to take the reader on an inner or “subjective” journey through the mind.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;  Humboldt is concerned with “the difference of feeling excited by the contemplation of nature at different epochs,” that is, the attitudes toward natural phenomena among poets, painters, and students of nature through the ages.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; The final three volumes are devoted to a more detailed account of scientific studies in astronomy, the earth’s physical properties, and geological formations.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; On the whole, the final work followed the scheme of the Berlin lectures reasonably faithfully.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

In the book Humboldt provided observations supporting the [[elevation crater|elevation crater theory]] of his friend [[Leopold von Buch]]. The theory in question intended to explain the [[mountain formation|origin of mountains]] and retained some popularity among geologists into the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Şengör |first=Celâl|author-link=Celâl Şengör |date=1982|chapter=Classical theories of orogenesis|editor-last=Miyashiro|editor-first=Akiho|editor-link=Akiho Miyashiro|editor-last2=Aki|editor-first2=Keiiti|editor-last3=Şengör|editor-first3=Celâl |title=Orogeny |url= |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=4–6 |isbn=0-471-103764|ref=Sengor1982}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to ''Cosmos''==

===Reception===

''Cosmos'' was considered to be both a scientific and literary achievement, immensely popular among nineteenth-century readers.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Although the book bore the daunting subtitle of ''A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe'', and had an index that ran to more than 1,000 pages, the first volume sold out in two months, the work was translated into all major languages and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.&lt;ref name="Sachs"&gt;Sachs, A. (1995, 03). Humboldt's legacy and the restoration of science. World Watch, 8, 28. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/230005809&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's publisher claimed: "The demand is epoch-making. Book parcels destined for London and St. Petersburg were torn out of our hands by agents who wanted their orders filled for the bookstores in Vienna and Hamburg." &lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;

''Cosmos'' largely enhanced Humboldt's reputation in his own lifetime, not only in his own country but throughout Europe and America as well. Its enthusiastic reception in England, where it came out in the Bohn Scientific Library in a translation by Elizabeth Leeves, particularly surprised him. The reviews were gushing in praise of both the author and his work.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

However, some felt he had not done justice to the contribution of modern British scientists and many were quick to point out that Humboldt, who had written so exhaustively about the creation of the universe, failed to ever mention God the Creator.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

===Legacy===

[[File:Humboldt Alexander, vor Uni Berlin.jpg|thumb|115px|left|Humboldt statue at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].]]
Humboldt's ''Cosmos'' had a significant impact on scientific progress, as well as various scientists and authors throughout Europe and America.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt; Humboldt's work gave a strong impetus to scientific exploration throughout the nineteenth century, inspiring many, including Charles Darwin, who brought some of Humboldt's earlier writings with him on his voyage as the naturalist aboard the ''Beagle'' in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Darwin called Humboldt "the greatest scientific traveler who ever lived."&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

''Cosmos'' influenced several American authors, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Emerson read Humboldt's work throughout his life, and for him, ''Cosmos'' capped Humboldt's role as a scientific revolutionary.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Edgar Allan Poe was also an admirer of Humboldt, even dedicating his last major work, ''Eureka: A Prose Poem'', to Humboldt.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences was a major inspiration for Poe's work.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Walt Whitman was said to have kept a copy of ''Cosmos'' on his desk for inspiration as he wrote ''Leaves of Grass'', and Henry David Thoreau's ''Walden'', like ''Eureka'', was a response to Humboldt's ideas.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt;

Although ''Cosmos'' and Humboldt's work in general had such a lasting impact on scientific thought, interest in Humboldt's life, work, and ideas over the past two centuries has dwindled in comparison to what it once was.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"&gt;Kent Mathewson, ''Humboldt's Twenty-First-Century Currency: Recent Upwellings, Commemorations, and Critical Commentaries" (New York: American Geographical Society, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, starting in the 1990s and continuing to date, an upswing in scholarly interest in Humboldt has occurred.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"/&gt; A new edition of ''Cosmos'' released in Germany in 2004 received avid reviews, renewing Humboldt's prominence in German society.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"/&gt; German media outlets hailed the largely forgotten Humboldt as a new avatar figure for German national renewal and a model cosmopolitan ambassador of German culture and civilization for the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"/&gt;

Humboldt is also credited with laying the foundations of physical geography, meteorology, and especially [[biogeography]]. His account in ''Cosmos'' of the propagation of seismic waves also became the basis of modern seismology.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; His most enduring contribution to scientific progress, however, in his conception of the unity of science, nature, and mankind.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; ''Cosmos'' showed nature as a whole, not as unconnected parts.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

'''Differential thermal analysis''' (or '''DTA''') is a [[thermal analysis|thermoanalytic]] technique that is similar to [[differential scanning calorimetry]]. In DTA, the material under study and an inert reference are made to undergo identical thermal cycles, (i.e., same cooling or heating programme) while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference.&lt;ref&gt;Bhadeshia H.K.D.H. “Thermal analyses techniques.

University of Cambridge, Material Science and Metallurgy. www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2002/Thermal1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample.

==Apparatus==
A DTA consists of a sample holder, thermocouples, sample containers and a ceramic or metallic block; a furnace; a temperature programmer; and a recording system. The key feature is the existence of two thermocouples connected to a voltmeter. One thermocouple is placed in an inert material such as [[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], while the other is placed in a sample of the material under study. As the temperature is increased, there will be a brief deflection of the voltmeter if the sample is undergoing a phase transition. This occurs because the input of heat will raise the temperature of the inert substance, but be incorporated as latent heat in the material changing phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Robert Bud, Deborah Jean Warner|title=Instruments of Science | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1AsFdUxOwu8C&amp;pg=PA170 | pages =170&amp;ndash;171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's instruments==
In today's market most manufacturers no longer make true DTA systems but rather have incorporated this technology into [[thermogravimetric analysis]] (TGA) systems, which provide both mass loss and thermal information. With today's advancements in software, even these instruments are being replaced by true TGA-[[differential scanning calorimetry|DSC]] instruments that can provide the temperature and heat flow of the sample, simultaneously with mass loss. 

==Applications==
A DTA curve can be used only as a ''finger print'' for identification purposes but usually the applications of this method are the determination of phase diagrams, heat change measurements and decomposition in various atmospheres.

DTA is widely used in the pharmaceutical&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer S., Borrás J., Martín Gil J. and Martín Gil F.J. "Thermal studies on sulphonamide derivative complexes”. ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1989, 147, 321 330; 1989, 153, 205 220; 1991, 185, 315 333.&lt;/ref&gt; and food industries.&lt;ref&gt;Berger K.G., Akehurst E.E. “Some applications of differential thermal analysis to oils and fats”. ''International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology'', 1966, 1, 237–247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramos Sánchez M.C., Rey F.J., Rodríguez M.L., Martín Gil F.J. and Martín Gil J. "DTG and DTA studies on typical sugars". ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1988, 134, 55 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Rey, M.C. Ramos-Sánchez, M.L.Rodríguez, J. Martín-Gil, F.J. Martín-Gil. "DTG and DTA studies on sugar derivatives". ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1988, 134, 67 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Méndez M.L., Rey F.J., Martín Gil J. and Martín Gil F.J. "DTG and DTA studies on amino acids". ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1988, 134, 73 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTA may be used in cement chemistry,&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran V.S. “Applications of differential thermal analysis in cement chemistry”. Chap. V, Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York (1969), 92.&lt;/ref&gt; mineralogical research&lt;ref&gt;Smykatz-Kloss W. “Application of differential thermal analysis in mineralogy”. ''J. Therm. Anal. Cal''., 1982, 23, 15-44.&lt;/ref&gt; and in environmental studies.&lt;ref&gt;Smykatz-Kloss W., Heil A, Kaeding L. and Roller E. “Thermal analysis in environmental studies”. In: ''Thermal analysis in Geosciences''. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTA curves may also be used to date bone remains&lt;ref&gt;Villanueva, PrE, Girela F. y Castellanos M. “The application of differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis to dating bone remains”. ''Journal of Forensic Sciences'', 1976, 21,&lt;/ref&gt; or to study archaeological materials.&lt;ref&gt;Misiego-Tejeda J.C., Marcos-Contreras G.J., Sarabia Herrero F.J., Martín Gil J. and Martín Gil F.J. "Un horno doméstico de la primera Edad del Hierro de "El Soto de Medinilla" (Valladolid) y su análisis por ATD". ''BSAA'' (University of Valladolid) 1993, LIX, 89 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingery W.D. “A note on the differential thermal analysis of archaeological ceramics”. ''Archaeometry'', 1974, 16, 109–112.&lt;/ref&gt;
Using DTA one can obtain liquidus &amp; solidus lines of phase diagrams.

'''Dissernet''' ({{lang-ru|Диссернет}}) is a volunteer community network working to clean Russian science of [[plagiarism]]. The core activity of the community is conducting examinations of [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] and [[habilitation]] (higher doctorate) theses defended in Russian scientific and educational institutions since the end of the 1990s, and making the results of such examinations known to as many people as possible. The community is composed of professional scientists working in various fields of science both in Russia and abroad, and also journalists, civil activists and volunteers.

Launched in early 2013, the project had by 2016 identified around 5,600 suspected plagiarists — focusing on officials in government and academia, and other member the country's elite — and released reports on around 1,300 of them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|title=The Craziest Black Market in Russia|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=2016-05-22|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-05-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230022705/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|archivedate=2016-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian media regularly report on Dissernet's findings, and the site has been credited with raising attention for the issue of [[academic fraud]] in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a 2016 exposé, Dissernet showed that 1 in 9 members of the [[State Duma]] had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The objective of Dissernet’s examinations is to detect gross and deliberate violations of the legally established rules for certification of scientific workers’, as well as violations of the regulations for awarding  [[academic degree]]s. Dissernet  deems theses containing such violations to be fraudulent, and diplomas certifying the doctoral and higher doctoral degrees conferred after defending such theses to be illegal and subject to cancellation.

The key elements of the dissertation fraud detected in the course of Dissernet’s analyses are as follows:

* Large-scale, bad faith and non-attributed  plagiarism   of other people's scientific works and other texts used by the authors of examined works in breach of the proper citation rules fixed in regulations of the  [[Higher Attestation Commission]] (VAK) of the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of Russia]];
* Falsification of scientific research articles which, according to VAK regulations, are a mandatory prerequisite for awarding the respective academic degree to the applicant;
* Gross violations of the rules for thesis preparation (documenting performed research, interaction with the scientific research supervisor, advisor, opponents, co-authors, getting formal responses, etc.) as well as the procedure for defense of the thesis prescribed by VAK regulations.

Within the active phase of Dissernet’s activity, which started in January 2013, its members have published results of examinations of thesis defended by scores of well-known and powerful Russian politicians and public figures. As of the{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} middle of the year 2014, more than 2000 completed expertises of Doctoral and higher doctoral theses in various directions and branches of science were contained in Dissernet database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissernet.org/expertise The latest expertises] on the Dissernet site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people attracting Dissernet’s attention were deputies of the [[State Duma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexandrova|first=Lyudmila|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/opinions/1451|title= Russia’s bloggers help authorities expose forged dissertations|publisher=[[Russian News Agency TASS]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]], [[governor (Russia)|governors]] of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, high-ranking officials of executive authorities,&lt;ref name="investigators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/crime/20131125/184982011/Russias-Top-Investigator-Accused-of-Plagiarism.html|title=Russia’s Top Investigator Accused of Plagiarism|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate= February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; heads of security and military services, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rupaper.com/post/12076|title=The Moscow minister will ask to cancel his thesis|publisher=Rupaper.com |date= December 2, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass media coverage ==
The work of the Dissernet community has gained much publicity and has been broadly covered in Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Girin|first=Nikita|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/60155.html|title=Это не про науку. Это про репутацию и враньё|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=107|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and foreign mass media.&lt;ref name="muckrakers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipman|first=Masha|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/russias-dissertation-fraud-muckrakers.html|title=Russia’s dissertation-fraud muckrakers|author=|date=March 9, 2013|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result of the research performed by the Monitoring Center Public.Ru (more than 7500 federal and regional social and political and business [[printed matter]]s, Internet [[mass media]], news feeds of [[News agency|Press agencies]], programs of central TV- and radio-channels have been analysed) showed that at 2013 year-end the word "Dissernet" was accepted as third by popularity [[neologism]] of the year, after the words "[[Euromaidan]]" and "[[titushky]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.ru/press_slovo_2013/|title=Пресс-слово 2013|publisher=Public.Ru|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magazine ''Russian Reporter'' mentioned Dissernet’s work among the most notable milestones of the year 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2013/50/vehi-goda/|title=Вехи года|work=Russian Reporter|number=50|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Internet edition ''The Village'' published an article about Dissernet in the dictionary "Summaries of 2013: main words and phrases of the outgoing year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krasilnikova|first=Nastya|url= http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/city/136119-slovar-2|title=Итоги 2013: главные слова и фразы уходящего года|work=The Village|date= December 23, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''[[Kommersant]]'', while listing in its concluding issue the major cultural and social events of the 2013, devoted a separate article to Dissernet’s struggle with falsifications and plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2369341|title="Диссернет" начал борьбу с фальсификациями и плагиатом|work=[[Kommersant|Kommersant Weekend]]|issue=47|date=December 20, 2013|page=69|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community manifest ==
The "Dissernet Manifest", which was developed and agreed upon in June–July 2013, contains the declaration of the organizers and members about the basic objectives, tasks and principles of joint activity of the community members:

“Dissernet”  is a networking community of experts, researchers and reporters seeking to unmask swindlers, forgers and liars. With their joint efforts based on the use of modern computer technologies and principles of networking division of labor, the community members oppose abusive practices, machinations and falsifications in the fields of scientific research and education, in particular in the process of defending theses and awarding academic degrees in Russia. The analytical work and disclosures of Dissernet equally cover various categories of Russian citizens:

* professional scientists or persons claiming to be such scientists without any valid basis.
* politicians and public figures seeking to improve their reputation and gain additional support and respect of their countrymen through defending theses and obtaining official diplomas conferring the doctoral and higher doctoral degree.

The Dissernet members act on a voluntary basis, on their own initiative and without any outside pressure. The examinations, studies and publications of Dissernet are in strict compliance with the laws of the Russian Federation and do not violate any [[copyright]] or other rights. Dissernet is under no obligations to any state authorities, governmental
or administrative institutions, political associations or movements, commercial corporations or entities. Its members work in the community irrespective of their political, corporate or any other views, they do not pursue any commercial purposes, their efforts are not aimed at advertising or promotion of any product or trademark, and they do not set any other goals except the above-mentioned ones. Dissernet’s expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its tasks are covered by means of voluntary donations by people sympathizing with its mission and sharing its views.

== History ==
The community was established in January 2013. The full Dissernet site, dissernet.org, as well as its reduced version, dissernet.ru, were opened on 23 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rupaper.com/post/4203|title="Dissernet's" community opened a site|publisher=Rupaper.com|date=September 24, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2014, Sergey Parkhomenko received the "Golden Pen of Russia" award from the Russian Union of Journalists for the year 2013, recognizing his "Dissernet" activity in press and in Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruj.ru/_balls_press/2013.php|title=Лауреаты премий Союза журналистов России за 2013 год|publisher=Russian Union of Journalists|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2014, the jury of the PolitProsvet Award 2014 conferred the Dissernet project with two awards, "For Honor and Dignity", and "People's Vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politprosvet.org/news/view/?47|title=Лев Гудков стал лауреатом премии "ПолитПросвет" сезона 2014!|publisher= PolitProsvet|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economic and Social Research Council''' ('''ESRC''') is one of the seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It receives most of its funding from the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], and provides funding and support for research and training work in the [[social sciences]] and [[economics]], such as postgraduate degrees.

==Structure==
The ESRC is based at Polaris House in [[Swindon]], UK which is also the location of the head offices of several other UK Research Councils and [[Innovate UK]]. ESRC is part of [[United Kingdom Research and Innovation]] (UKRI)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukri.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;, an organisation that brings together the UK’s research councils, Innovate UK and [[Research England]]. UKRI is a [[non-departmental public body]] funded by a grant-in-aid from the [[UK government]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} &lt;ref name="ESRC what they do"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/what-we-do/|title = ESRC what they do|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ESRC's mission, according to its website, is to:&lt;ref name="mission, strategy and priorities"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/strategy-and-priorities/|title = ESRC mission, strategy and priorities|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* promote and support, by any means, high-quality research and related postgraduate training on social and economic issues
* develop and support the national data infrastructure that underpins high-quality research
* advance knowledge and provide trained social scientists who meet the needs of users and beneficiaries, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of the UK, the effectiveness of public services and policy, and the quality of life
* communicate clearly and promote public understanding of social science.

==History==
The ESRC was founded in 1965 as the ''Social Science Research Council'' (SSRC - not to be confused with the [[Social Science Research Council]] in the United States). The establishment of a state [[funding body]] for the social sciences in the United Kingdom, had been under discussion since the [[World War II|Second World War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ESRC's history|publisher = ESRC|date = December 2015|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the 1964 election of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] that the political climate for the creation of the SSRC became sufficiently favourable.

The first chief executive of the SSRC was [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (later Baron Young of Dartington). Subsequent holders of the post have included [[Michael Posner (economist)|Michael Posner]], later Secretary General of the [[European Science Foundation]]. The current Chief Executive of the ESRC is [https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/governance-and-structure/directors/jennifer-rubin/ Professor Jennifer Rubin] who took over from Professor [[Jane Elliott (academic)|Jane Elliott]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = King's Professor Jennifer Rubin appointed ESRC Chief Executive|publisher = KCL|url = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/news/newsrecords/2017/King's-Professor-Jennifer-Rubin-appointed-ESRC-Chief-Executive.aspx|accessdate = 2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Change of name===
Following the election of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 general election, the Government expressed reservations about the value of research in the social sciences, and the extent to which it should be publicly funded. In 1981, the Education Secretary [[Keith Joseph|Sir Keith Joseph]] asked [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] to lead a review into the future of the SSRC.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It was ultimately decided (due in no small part to the efforts of Michael Posner, chief executive of the SSRC at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michael Posner Obituary|publisher = The Independent|date = April 2009|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-posner-6107063.html|accessdate = 2015-12-03|location = London|first = Michael|last = Kuczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the Council should remain, but that its remit should be expanded beyond the social sciences, to include more 'empirical' research and research of 'more public concern'. To reflect this, in 1983 the SSRC was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SSRC/ESRC: the first forty years|publisher = ESRC|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/ssrc-and-esrc-the-first-forty-years/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electroacupuncture''' is a form of [[acupuncture]] where a small [[electric current]] is passed between pairs of acupuncture needles. 
According to some acupuncturists{{Who|date=March 2018}}, this practice augments the use of regular acupuncture, can restore [[health]] and well-being, and is particularly good for treating [[pain]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  There is evidence for some efficacy (when used in addition to [[antiemetics]]) in treating moderate post-[[chemotherapy]] [[vomiting]], but not for acute vomiting or delayed nausea severity {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

==Use by acupuncturists==

According to ''Acupuncture Today'', a [[trade journal]] for acupuncturists:

:"Electroacupuncture is quite similar to traditional acupuncture in that the same points are stimulated during treatment. As with traditional acupuncture, needles are inserted on specific points along the body. The needles are then attached to a device that generates continuous electric pulses using small clips. These devices are used to adjust the frequency and intensity of the impulse being delivered, depending on the condition being treated. Electroacupuncture uses two needles at time so that the impulses can pass from one needle to the other. Several pairs of needles can be stimulated simultaneously, usually for no more than 30 minutes at a time."&lt;ref name="acupuncturetoday.com"&gt;{{cite web
| title      = Acupuncture Today: Electroacupuncture
| date       = 2004-02-01
| url        = http://www.acupuncturetoday.com/abc/electroacupuncture.php
| accessdate = 2006-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That article adds:
:"According to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, illness is caused when chi does not flow properly throughout the body. Acupuncturists determine whether chi is weak, stagnant or otherwise out of balance, which indicates the points to be stimulated. Electroacupuncture is considered to be especially useful for conditions in which there is an accumulation of chi, such as in chronic pain syndromes, or in cases where the chi is difficult to stimulate."&lt;ref name="acupuncturetoday.com"/&gt;

Electroacupuncture is also variously termed EA, electro-acupuncture or incorporated under the generic term [[electrotherapy]].

''Electroacupuncture according to Voll'' (EAV) claims to measure "energy" in acupuncture points and to diagnose ailments. Some devices are registered in FDA as galvanic skin response measuring devices; they may not be used in diagnosis and treatment. Units reportedly sell for around $15,000 and are promoted for diagnosis of conditions including "parasites, food and environmental sensitivities, candida, nutritional deficiencies and much more."&lt;ref name="ScienceBasedmedicine"&gt;[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=141 Science Based Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; It is promoted for diagnosis of allergies.

==Scientific research==
The [[Cochrane Collaboration]], a group of [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) reviewers, reviewed eleven [[randomized controlled trials]] on the use of electroacupuncture at the P6 [[acupuncture point]] to control [[chemotherapy]]-induced [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]].  The reviewers found that electroacupuncture applied along with anti-vomiting drugs reduced first-day vomiting after chemotherapy more effectively than anti-vomiting drugs alone.  However, the drugs given were not the most modern drugs available, so the reviewers stated that further research with state-of-the-art drugs was needed to determine clinical relevance.  The reviewers concluded:
:"This review complements data on post-operative nausea and vomiting suggesting a biologic effect of acupuncture-point stimulation. Electroacupuncture has demonstrated benefit for chemotherapy-induced acute vomiting, but studies combining electroacupuncture with state-of-the-art antiemetics and in patients with refractory symptoms are needed to determine clinical relevance. Self-administered acupressure appears to have a protective effect for acute nausea and can readily be taught to patients though studies did not involve placebo control.

The Cochrane Collaboration also reviewed acupuncture and electroacupuncture for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]].  Because of the small number and poor quality of studies, they found no evidence to recommend its use for this condition.  The reviewers concluded:
:"Although the results of the study on electroacupuncture show that electroacupuncture may be beneficial to reduce symptomatic knee pain in patients with RA 24 hours and 4 months post treatment, the reviewers concluded that the poor quality of the trial, including the small sample size preclude its recommendation. The reviewers further conclude that acupuncture has no effect on ESR, CRP, pain, patient's global assessment, number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, general health, disease activity and reduction of analgesics. These conclusions are limited by methodological considerations such as the type of acupuncture (acupuncture vs electroacupuncture), the site of intervention, the low number of clinical trials and the small sample size of the included studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casimiro L, Barnsley L, Brosseau L |editor1-last=Casimiro |editor1-first=Lynn |title=Acupuncture and electroacupuncture for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD003788 |year=2005 |pmid=16235342 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003788.pub2 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003788.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found inconclusive evidence that electroacupuncture was effective for nausea and vomiting and [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van den Heuvel|first1=E|last2=Goossens|first2=M|last3=Vanderhaegen|first3=H|last4=Sun|first4=HX|last5=Buntinx|first5=F|title=Effect of acustimulation on nausea and vomiting and on hyperemesis in pregnancy: a systematic review of Western and Chinese literature.|journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=13 January 2016|volume=16|pages=13|doi=10.1186/s12906-016-0985-4|pmid=26758211|pmc=4711053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding EAV devices, "results are not reproducible when subject to rigorous testing and do not correlate with clinical evidence of allergy".&lt;ref name="Wuethrich"/&gt; There is no credible evidence of diagnostic capability.&lt;ref name="Wuethrich"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wüthrich B |title=Unproven techniques in allergy diagnosis |journal=J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=86–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16047707 |doi= |url=http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol15issue02/1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] has concluded that the evidence does not support the use of EAV "as a method that can diagnose, cure, or otherwise help people with cancer" or "as a reliable aid in diagnosis or treatment of .. other illness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/manualhealingandphysicaltouch/electrodermal-screening | title=Electrodermal Screening | work=ACS | accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In double-blind trials, "A wide variability of the measurements was found in most patients irrespective of their allergy status and of the substance tested. Allergic patients showed more negative skin electrical response at the second trial, compared to normal controls, independent of the tested substance. No significant difference in skin electrical response between allergens and negative controls could be detected."&lt;ref name="CEA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Semizzi M, Senna G, Crivellaro M |title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the diagnostic accuracy of an electrodermal test in allergic subjects |journal=Clin.

==Safety==
Researchers at the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (Rockville, Maryland) evaluated three representative devices intended for electrostimulation of acupuncture needles. The abstract at [[PubMed]] summarizes their findings:
:"Three representative electrostimulators were evaluated to determine whether they meet the manufacturers' labeled nominal output parameters and how the measured parameters compare with a safety standard written for implanted peripheral nerve stimulators. The pulsed outputs (pulse width, frequency, and voltage) of three devices were measured with an oscilloscope across a 500-ohm resistance, meant to simulate subdermal tissue stimulated during electroacupuncture. For each device, at least two measured parameters were not within 25% of the manufacturer's claimed values. The measured values were compared with the American National Standard ANSI/AAMI NS15 safety standard for implantable peripheral nerve stimulators. Although for two stimulators the pulse voltage at maximum intensity was above that specified by the standard, short-term clinical use may still be safe because the standard was written for long-term stimulation. Similarly, the net unbalanced DC current, which could lead to tissue damage, electrolysis, and electrolytic degradation of the acupuncture needle, was within the limits of the standard at 30 pulses per second, but not at higher frequencies. The primary conclusions are (1) that the outputs of electrostimulators must be calibrated and (2) that practitioners must be adequately trained to use these electrostimulators safely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/acm.2000.6.37 |vauthors=Lytle CD, Thomas BM, Gordon EA, Krauthamer V |title=Electrostimulators for acupuncture: safety issues |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10706234 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235227/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Floodplain restoration''' is the process of fully or partially restoring a river's [[floodplain]] to its original conditions before having been affected by the construction of [[levee]]s (dikes) and the draining of [[wetland]]s and [[marsh]]es. 

The objectives of restoring floodplains include the reduction of the incidence of [[flood]]s, the provision of [[habitats]] for [[Aquatic animal|aquatic species]], the improvement of [[water quality]] and the increased recharge of [[groundwater]].

[[Image:Greffern Polder inBetrieb.jpg|thumb|Road flooded intentionally in a [[Polder#Germany|polder]] on the [[Upper Rhine]]]]
=== Europe ===
In Europe very few schemes for restoring functional floodplains have been put in practice so far, despite a surge of interest in the topic among policy and research circles. One of the drivers for floodplain restoration is the EU [[Water Framework Directive]]. Early floodplain restoration schemes were undertaken in the mid-1990s in the Rheinvorland-Süd on the Upper [[Rhine]], the [[Bourret, Tarn-et-Garonne|Bourret]] on the [[Garonne]], and as part of the [[Long Eau]] project in England. Ongoing schemes in 2007 include [[Lenzen]] on the [[Elbe]], [[La Basse]] on the [[Seine]] and the [[Parrett]] Catchment Project in England.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Timothy and Jochen Monstadt: Restoring Floodplains in Europe. Policy Contexts and Project Experiences, International Water Association 2008, {{ISBN|1-84339-090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Elbe]] River near [[Lenzen]] (Brandenburg) 420 hectares of floodplain were restored in order to prevent a recurrence of the Elbe floods of 2002. A total of 20 floodplain restoration projects on the Elbe River were envisaged after the 2002 floods, but only two have been implemented as of 2009 according to the environmental group [[:de:BUND]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Europäischer Wirtscchaftsdients Wasser und Abwasser Nr. 34, August 18, 2009:Internationale Kommission zum Schutz der Elbe:Elbe-Hochwasser wie 2002 nicht mehr möglich&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]] examples of floodplain restoration can be found in the catchment area of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landstudies.com/legacysediments.html Land Studies:Legacy Sediments and Floodplain Restoration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514011253/http://www.landstudies.com/legacysediments.html |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Emiquon Project|Emiquon Preserve]] on the [[Illinois River]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/illinois/press/emiquon.html The Nature Conservancy Launches Landmark Floodplain Restoration at the Emiquon Preserve, May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Charlotte]], North Carolina &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charmeck.org/Departments/StormWater/Storm+Water+Professionals/Project+Floodplain+Restoration.htm Floodplain Restoration in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County]&lt;/ref&gt; and along the [[Baraboo River]] in Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sandcounty.net/programs/pioneers/floodplain_rehab/ Floodplain Rehabilitation along the Baraboo River] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006222835/http://www.sandcounty.net/programs/pioneers/floodplain_rehab/ |date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''graph isomorphism problem''' is the [[computational problem]] of determining whether two finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]].

The problem is not known to be solvable in [[polynomial time]] nor to be [[NP-complete]], and therefore may be in the computational [[complexity class]] [[NP-intermediate]].  It is known that the graph isomorphism problem is in the [[low hierarchy]] of [[class NP]], which implies that it is not NP-complete unless the [[polynomial time hierarchy]] collapses to its second level.{{sfnp|Schöning|1987}}  At the same time, isomorphism for many special classes of graphs can be solved in polynomial time, and in practice graph isomorphism can often be solved efficiently.{{sfnp|McKay|1981}}

This problem is a special case of the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]],{{sfnp|Ullman|1976}} which asks whether a given graph ''G'' contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to another given graph ''H'' and which is known to be NP-complete. It is also known to be a special case of the [[Abelian group|non-abelian]] [[hidden subgroup problem]] over the [[symmetric group]].{{sfnp|Moore|Russell|Schulman|2008}}

In the area of [[image recognition]] it is known as the [[exact graph matching]].&lt;ref name=endikaCh2&gt;Endika Bengoetxea, [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/ "Inexact Graph Matching Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms"], Ph.
 D., 2002, [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/Ch2.pdf Chapter 2:The graph matching problem] (retrieved June 28, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==State of the art==
The best currently accepted theoretical algorithm is due to {{harvtxt|Babai|Luks|1983}}, and is based on the earlier work by {{harvtxt|Luks|1982}} combined with a ''subfactorial'' algorithm of V. N. Zemlyachenko {{harv|Zemlyachenko|Korneenko|Tyshkevich|1985}}.  The algorithm has run time 2&lt;sup&gt;O({{sqrt|''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''}})&lt;/sup&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices and relies on the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. Without CFSG, a slightly weaker bound 
{{math|2&lt;sup&gt;O({{sqrt|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;|size=100%}} was obtained first for [[strongly regular graph]]s by {{harvs|authorlink=László Babai|first=László|last=Babai|year=1980|txt}}, and then extended to general graphs by {{harvtxt|Babai|Luks|1983}}.  Improvement of the exponent {{sqrt|''n''}} is a major open problem; for strongly regular graphs this was done by {{Harvtxt|Spielman|1996}}.  For [[hypergraph]]s of bounded rank, a [[Sub-exponential time|subexponential]] upper bound matching the case of graphs was obtained by {{Harvtxt|Babai|Codenotti|2008}}.

In November 2015, Babai announced a [[Time complexity#Quasi-polynomial time|quasipolynomial time]] algorithm for all graphs, that is, one with running time &lt;math&gt;2^{O((\log n)^c)}&lt;/math&gt; for some fixed &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mathematician claims breakthrough in complexity theory|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/math/2015/11/mathematician-claims-breakthrough-complexity-theory|work=Science|date=Nov 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Babai|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/  Video of first 2015 lecture linked from Babai's home page]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 2017, Babai retracted the quasi-polynomial claim and stated a [[sub-exponential time]] bound instead after [[Harald Helfgott]] discovered a flaw in the proof. On January 9, 2017, Babai announced a correction (published in full on January 19) and restored the quasi-polynomial claim, with Helfgott confirming the fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Babai|first= László|url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/update.html|title=Graph isomorphism update|date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Erika Klarreich}}, ''Graph Isomorphism Vanquished — Again'', Quanta Magazine,  January 14, 2017 [https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170114-graph-isomorphism-babai-fix/ see here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Helfgott further claims that one can take {{math|1=''c'' = 3}}, so the running time is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;O((log ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Helfgott|first=Harald|arxiv=1701.04372|title=Isomorphismes de graphes en temps quasi-polynomial (d'après Babai et Luks, Weisfeiler-Leman...)|date=January 16, 2017|bibcode=2017arXiv170104372A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new proof has not been fully peer-reviewed yet.

There are several competing practical algorithms for graph isomorphism, such as those due to {{harvtxt|McKay|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Schmidt|Druffel|1976}}, and {{harvtxt|Ullman|1976}}.  While they seem to perform well on [[random graphs]], a major drawback of these algorithms is their exponential time performance in the [[Best, worst and average case|worst case]].{{sfnp|Foggia|Sansone|Vento|2001}}

The graph isomorphism problem is computationally equivalent to the problem of computing the [[automorphism group]] of a graph, and is weaker than the [[permutation group]] isomorphism problem and the permutation group intersection problem.  For the latter two problems, {{harvtxt|Babai|Kantor|Luks|1983}} obtained complexity bounds similar to that for graph isomorphism.

==Solved special cases==
A number of important special cases of the graph isomorphism problem have efficient, polynomial-time solutions:
* [[Tree (graph theory)|Tree]]s{{sfnp|Kelly|1957}}{{sfnp|Aho|Hopcroft|Ullman|1974|p=84-86}}
* [[Planar graph]]s{{sfnp|Hopcroft|Wong|1974}} (In fact, planar graph isomorphism is in [[L (complexity)|log space]],{{sfnp|Datta|Limaye|Nimbhorkar|Thierauf|2009}} a class contained in [[P (complexity)|P]])
* [[Interval graph]]s{{sfnp|Booth|Lueker|1979}}
* [[Permutation graph]]s{{sfnp|Colbourn|1981}}
* [[Circulant graph]]s{{sfnp|Muzychuk|2004}}
*Bounded-parameter graphs
** Graphs of bounded [[treewidth]]{{sfnp|Bodlaender|1990}}
** Graphs of bounded [[genus (mathematics)|genus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1980}}; {{harvnb|Filotti|Mayer|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: planar graphs are graphs of genus 0)
** Graphs of bounded [[degree (graph theory)|degree]]{{sfnp|Luks|1982}}
** Graphs with bounded [[eigenvalue]] multiplicity{{sfnp|Babai|Grigoryev|Mount|1982}}
** ''k''-Contractible graphs (a generalization of bounded degree and bounded genus){{sfnp|Miller|1983}}
**Color-preserving isomorphism of [[colored graph]]s with bounded color multiplicity (i.e., at most ''k'' vertices have the same color for a fixed ''k'') is in class [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which is a subclass of [[P (complexity)|P]]{{sfnp|Luks|1986}}

== Complexity class GI ==&lt;!-- [[GI]] links and [[GI (complexity)]] redirects to this section --&gt;
Since the graph isomorphism problem is neither known to be NP-complete nor known to be tractable, researchers have sought to gain insight into the problem by defining a new class '''GI''', the set of problems with a [[polynomial-time Turing reduction]] to the graph isomorphism problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Booth|Colbourn|1977}}; {{harvnb|Köbler|Schöning|Torán|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If in fact the graph isomorphism problem is solvable in polynomial time, '''GI''' would equal '''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''.

As is common for [[complexity class]]es within the [[polynomial time hierarchy]], a problem is called '''GI-hard''' if there is a [[polynomial-time Turing reduction]] from any problem in '''GI''' to that problem, i.e.,  a polynomial-time solution to a GI-hard problem would yield a polynomial-time solution to the graph isomorphism problem (and so all problems in '''GI''').  A problem &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called [[complete (complexity)|complete]] for '''GI''', or '''GI-complete''', if it is both GI-hard and a polynomial-time solution to the GI problem would yield a polynomial-time solution to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The graph isomorphism problem is contained in both '''NP''' and co-'''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]'''. GI is contained in and [[low (complexity)|low]] for [[Parity P]], as well as contained in the potentially much smaller class [https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:S#spp SPP].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Köbler|Schöning|Torán|1992}}; {{harvnb|Arvind|Kurur|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; That it lies in Parity P means that the graph isomorphism problem is no harder than determining whether a polynomial-time [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] has an even or odd number of accepting paths. GI is also contained in and low for [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]&lt;sup&gt;NP&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfnp|Arvind|Köbler|2000}} This essentially means that an efficient [[Las Vegas algorithm]] with access to an NP [[oracle machine|oracle]] can solve graph isomorphism so easily that it gains no power from being given the ability to do so in constant time.

===GI-complete and GI-hard problems===

====Isomorphism of other objects====
There are a number of classes of mathematical objects for which the problem of isomorphism is a GI-complete problem. A number of them are graphs endowed with additional properties or restrictions:&lt;ref name=zkt&gt;{{harvtxt|Zemlyachenko|Korneenko|Tyshkevich|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

====GI-complete classes of graphs====
A class of graphs is called GI-complete if recognition of isomorphism for graphs from this subclass is a GI-complete problem. The following classes are GI-complete:&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;
*[[connected graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*graphs of [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] 2 and [[radius (graph theory)|radius]] 1&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;
*[[directed acyclic graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[regular graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[bipartite graph]]s without non-trivial [[strongly regular graph|strongly regular subgraphs]]&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*bipartite [[Eulerian graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;

*[[line graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[split graph]]s{{sfnp|Chung|1985}}
*[[chordal graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*regular [[self-complementary graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[polytopal graph]]s of general, [[simple polytope|simple]], and [[simplicial polytope|simplicial]] [[convex polytope]]s in arbitrary dimensions.{{sfnp|Kaibel|Schwartz|2003}}
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
Many classes of digraphs are also GI-complete.

====Other GI-complete problems====
There are other nontrivial GI-complete problems in addition to isomorphism problems.
*The recognition of self-complementarity of a graph or digraph.{{sfnp|Colbourn|Colbourn|1978}}
*A [[clique problem]] for a class of so-called ''M''-graphs. It is shown that finding an isomorphism for ''n''-vertex graphs is equivalent to finding an ''n''-clique in an ''M''-graph of size ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This fact is interesting because the problem of finding an (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ε'')-clique in a ''M''-graph  of size ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is NP-complete for arbitrarily small positive ε.{{sfnp|Kozen|1978}}
*The problem of homeomorphism of 2-complexes.{{sfnp|Shawe-Taylor|Pisanski|1994}}

====GI-hard problems====
*The problem of counting the number of isomorphisms between two graphs is polynomial-time equivalent to the problem of telling whether even one exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mathon|1979}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The problem of deciding whether two [[convex polytope]]s given by either the [[V-description]] or [[H-description]] are projectively or affinely isomorphic. The latter means existence of a projective or affine map between the spaces that contain the two polytopes (not necessarily of the same dimension) which induces a bijection between the polytopes.{{sfnp|Kaibel|Schwartz|2003}}

==Program checking==

{{harvs|first1=Manuel|last1=Blum|author1-link=Manuel Blum|first2=Sampath|last2=Kannan|year=1995|txt}} have shown a probabilistic checker for programs for  graph isomorphism. Suppose ''P'' is a claimed polynomial-time procedure that checks if two graphs are isomorphic, but it is not trusted. To check if ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic:

* Ask ''P'' whether ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic.
** If the answer is "yes':
*** Attempt to construct an isomorphism using ''P'' as subroutine. Mark a vertex ''u'' in ''G'' and ''v'' in ''H'', and modify the graphs to make them distinctive (with a small local change). Ask ''P'' if the modified graphs are isomorphic. If no, change ''v'' to a different vertex. Continue searching.
*** Either the isomorphism will be found (and can be verified), or ''P'' will contradict itself.
** If the answer is "no":
*** Perform the following 100 times. Choose randomly ''G'' or ''H'', and randomly permute its vertices. Ask ''P'' if the graph is isomorphic to ''G'' and ''H''. (As in [[AM (complexity)|AM]] protocol for graph nonisomorphism).
*** If any of the tests are failed, judge ''P'' as invalid program. Otherwise, answer "no".

This procedure is polynomial-time and gives the correct answer if ''P'' is a correct program for graph isomorphism. If ''P'' is not a correct program, but answers correctly on ''G'' and ''H'', the checker will either give the correct answer, or detect invalid behaviour of ''P''.
If ''P'' is not a correct program, and answers incorrectly on ''G'' and ''H'', the checker will detect invalid behaviour of ''P'' with high probability, or answer wrong with probability 2&lt;sup&gt;−100&lt;/sup&gt;.

Notably, ''P'' is used only as a blackbox.

== Applications ==

Graphs are commonly used to encode structural information in many fields, including [[computer vision]] and [[pattern recognition]], and [[graph matching]], i.e., identification of similarities between graphs, is an important tools in these areas. In these areas graph isomorphism problem is known as the exact graph matching.&lt;ref name=endikaAbstract&gt;Endika Bengoetxea, Ph.D., [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/ Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cheminformatics]] and in [[mathematical chemistry]], graph isomorphism testing is used to identify a [[chemical compound]] within a [[chemical database]].{{sfnp|Irniger|2005}} Also, in organic mathematical chemistry graph isomorphism testing is useful for generation of [[molecular graph]]s and for [[Combinatorial chemistry|computer synthesis]].

Chemical database search is an example of graphical [[data mining]], where the [[graph canonization]] approach is often used.{{sfnp|Cook|Holder|2007}} In particular, a number of [[identifier]]s for [[chemical substance]]s,  such as [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]], designed to provide a standard and human-readable way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web, use canonization step in their computation, which is essentially the canonization of the graph which represents the molecule.

In [[electronic design automation]] graph isomorphism is the basis of the [[Layout Versus Schematic]] (LVS) circuit design step, which is a verification whether the [[electric circuit]]s represented by a [[circuit diagram|circuit schematic]] and an [[integrated circuit layout]] are the same.{{sfnp|Baird|Cho|1975}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of [[scientific method]]. According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.  It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==
{{main|Scientific method}}
One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) ''Theory and Reality'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-left:1.25em;text-indent:-1.25em"&gt;
:'''''1'''''. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''.
:'''''2'''''. Form a conjecture ([[hypothesis]]): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:'''''3'''''. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume&amp;nbsp;'''''2''''' is true, what consequences follow?
:'''''4'''''. Test (or [[experiment]]): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. It is a logical error to seek&amp;nbsp;'''''3''''' directly as proof of&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. This [[formal fallacy]] is called ''[[affirming the consequent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} e.g., p. 58, devotes his chapter 5 to ''the error of confirmation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One possible sequence in this model would be '''''1''''', '''''2''''', '''''3''''', '''''4'''''. If the outcome of '''''4''''' holds, and '''''3''''' is not yet disproven, you may continue with '''''3''''', '''''4''''', '''''1''''', and so forth; but if the outcome of '''''4''''' shows '''''3''''' to be false, you will have to go back to '''''2''''' and try to invent a '''''new 2''''', deduce a '''''new 3''''', look for '''''4''''', and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely '''verify''' (prove the truth of) '''''2'''''. It can only '''[[Falsifiability|falsify]]''' '''''2'''''.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably." —[[Christiaan Huygens]], Letter to Pierre Perrault, 'Sur la préface de M.

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by [[Carl Hempel]] (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Murzi, Mauro (2001, 2008), "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm Carl Gustav Hempel (1905—1997)]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Murzi used the term relative frequency rather than probability.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a [[Bayesian analysis]], with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. [[Bayes' theorem]] shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also [[confirmation holism]].

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The [[raven paradox]] is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.  Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[John N.W. Watkins]] (1984), ''Science and Skepticism'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis.  Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such ''immunizing stratagems'' is conducive to the progress of science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1979, Rev. ed.), ''Objective Knowledge'', pp. 30, 360.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] claims the model ignores [[underdetermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/07/03/what-is-science/ |author=Sean Carroll |title=What is Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models'''

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Mesly |first= Olivier | date= 2015 |title= Creating Models in Psychological Research | location= United States | publisher= Springer Psychology  |pages= 126  |ISBN = 978-3-319-15752-8}}

'''''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation''''' is an influential [[computer science]] textbook by [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] on [[formal language]]s and the [[theory of computation]].  [[Rajeev Motwani]] contributed to the 2000, and later, edition.

== Nickname ==
Among experts also known as the '''''Cinderella Book'''''.  This nickname  is derived from a girl (putatively [[Cinderella]]) on the cover with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]].

== Edition history and reception ==
The forerunner of this book appeared under the title '''''Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata''''' in 1968. Forming a basis both for the creation of courses on the topic, as well as for further research, that book shaped the field of [[automata theory]] for over a decade, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).

[[File:Hopcroft-ullman-old.jpg|thumb|left|''Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata'' appeared in 1968, with an inornate cover.]]

The first edition of ''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'' was published in 1979, the second edition in November 2000, and the third edition appeared in February 2006. Since the second edition, [[Rajeev Motwani]] has joined Hopcroft and Ullman as third author. 
Starting with the second edition, the book features extended coverage of examples where [[automata theory]] is applied, whereas large parts of more advanced theory were taken out. While this makes the second and third editions more accessible to beginners, it makes it less suited for more advanced courses. The new bias away from theory is not seen positive by all: As [[Jeffrey Shallit|Shallit]] quotes one professor, "they have removed all good parts." (Shallit 2008).

The first edition in turn constituted a major revision of a previous textbook also written by Hopcroft and Ullman, entitled ''Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata''. It was published in 1968 and is referred to in the introduction of the 1979 edition. 
In a personal historical note regarding the 1968 book, Hopcroft states: "Perhaps the success of the book came from our efforts to present the essence of each proof before actually giving the proof" (Hopcroft 1989). Compared with the forerunner book, the 1979 edition was expanded, and the material was reworked to make it more accessible to students, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).
This gearing towards understandability at the price of succinctness was not seen positive by all. As Hopcroft reports on feedback to the overhauled 1979 edition: "It seems that our attempts to lower the level of our presentation for the benefit of students by including more detail and explanations had an adverse effect on the faculty, who then had to sift through the added material to outline and prepare their lectures" (Hopcroft 1989).

Still, the most cited edition of the book is apparently the 1979 edition: According to the website [[CiteSeerX]], 
over 3000 scientific papers freely available online cite this edition of the book (CiteSeerX, 2009).

'''Joseph Finnegan''' (April 12, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 8, 1980) was an [[United States|American]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] with [[Station Hypo]] during the [[Second World War]].

==War contribution==
In 2002, [[Tex Biard]] described Finnegan as "intuitive" and "brilliant", and second only to Station Hypo chief [[Joseph J. Rochefort]], saying that Finnegan's survival of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing]] of the ''[[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|USS Tennessee]]'' was a "fatal mistake" on the part of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]], and that Finnegan's survival "cost (the Japanese) the war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usspennsylvania.com/TheDungeon.htm Transcript of Tex Biard's 2002 speech] at USSPennsylvania.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin T. Layton]], in his book "''And I Was There:  Pearl Harbor and Midway -- Breaking the Secrets''" (1985) recounts a tremendous effort by Finnegan on the Hypo team concerning the exact date on which the attack on Midway would occur.  This involved the date-time groups in Japanese naval messages.

Layton refers to the date-time data as being “superenciphered,” meaning that this data was preencoded even before it was added to the [[JN-25]] cipher.  When Hypo made their all-out effort to crack this, they started by searching the stacks of printouts and [[punched cards]] for five-digit number sequences.  Those they found were in low grade codes, a poor starting point, but a starting point.

{{Cquote| Next they had to unravel the cipher itself.  It was Lieutenant Joseph Finnegan, a linguist-cryptanalyst, who finally hit upon the method that the Japanese had used to lock up their date-time groups.}}

Layton describes this method as "involving a 12 x 31 (12 rows for months, 31 columns for day) garble check.  The 31 kana [Japanese syllabic scripts] of the first row were A, I, U, E, O, KA, KI …………….HA, HI, HU, HE, HO.  The second row was I, U, E, O ……………HE, HO, A; the third, U, E, O ……….HO, A, I, and so on, for 12 rows.  At the left, representing the 12 months, was a column of 12 kana, different from those in the table – SA, AI, SU, SE, SO, TA, TI, TU, TE, TO, NA, NI (SA for January, NI for December).  To encipher, for example 27 May, one picked the 5th line (May=SO), ran across to the twenty-seventh column, HA, and recorded the kana at that intersection, HO.  The encipherment, then, was SO, HA, HO, the third kana providing the garble check." (Layton, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–428)

== Importance of land change modeling ==
[[File:Spycharka DT 75.JPG|thumb|Bulldozers are often used to clear land for development or agriculture.]]
Changes in [[land systems]] have consequences for climate and environmental change on every scale. Therefore, decisions and policies in relation to land systems are very important for reacting these changes and working towards a more sustainable society and planet.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land change models are significant in their ability to help guide the land systems to positive societal and environmental outcomes at a time when attention to changes across land systems is increasing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Briassoulis|first=Helen|date=2000-01-01|title=Analysis of Land Use Change: Theoretical and Modeling Approaches|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/rriwholbk/17.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plethora of science and practitioner communities have been able to advance the amount and quality of data in land change modeling in the past few decades. That has influenced the development of methods and technologies in model land change. The multitudes of land change models that have been developed are significant in their ability to address land system change and useful in various science and practitioner communities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For the science community, land change models are important in their ability to test theories and concepts of land change and its connections to human-environment relationships, as well as explore how these dynamics will change future land systems without real-world observation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Land change modeling is useful to explore spatial land systems, uses, and covers. Land change modeling can account for complexity within dynamics of land use and land cover by linking with climactic, ecological, biogeochemical, biogeophysical and socioeconomic models. Additionally, LCMs are able to produce spatially explicit outcomes according to the type and complexity within the land system dynamics within the spatial extent. Many biophysical and socioeconomic variables influence and produce a variety of outcomes in land change modeling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Model uncertainty ==
[[File:Uriage Land Cover Change.png|thumb|300x300px|Land change is visible in this image from Japan. Models cannot be as certain as satellite imagery.]]
A notable property of all land change models is that they have some irreducible level of uncertainty in the model structure, parameter values, and/or input data. For instance, one uncertainty within land change models is a result from [[wikt:temporal|temporal]] non-stationarity that exists in land change processes, so the further into the future the model is applied, the more uncertain it is.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=XiaoHang|last2=Andersson|first2=Claes|date=2004-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of temporal dynamics on land-use change modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971502000455|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|series=Geosimulation|volume=28|issue=1–2|pages=107–124|doi=10.1016/S0198-9715(02)00045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another uncertainty within land change models are data and [[parameter]] uncertainties within physical principles (i.e., surface typology), which leads to uncertainties in being able to understand and predict physical processes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Furthermore, land change model design are a product of both decision-making and physical processes. Human-induced impact on the socio-economic and ecological environment is important to take into account, as it is constantly changing land cover and sometimes model uncertainty. To avoid model uncertainty and interpret model outputs more accurately, a model diagnosis is used to understand more about the connections between land change models and the actual land system of the spatial extent. The overall importance of model diagnosis with model uncertainty issues is its ability to assess how interacting processes and the landscape are represented, as well as the uncertainty within the landscape and its processes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Approaches to land change modeling ==

=== Machine learning &amp; statistical models ===
A [[Machine learning|machine-learning approach]] uses land-cover data from the past to try to assess how land will change in the future, and works best with large datasets. There are multiple types of machine-learning and statistical models - a study in western Mexico from 2011 found that results from two outwardly similar models were considerably different, as one used a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] and the other used a simple weights-of-evidence model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pérez-Vega|first=Azucena|last2=Mas|first2=Jean-François|last3=Ligmann-Zielinska|first3=Arika|date=2012-03-01|title=Comparing two approaches to land use/cover change modeling and their implications for the assessment of biodiversity loss in a deciduous tropical forest|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481521100209X|journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software|volume=29|issue=1|pages=11–23|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular models ===
A [[Cellular automaton|cellular]] land change model uses maps of suitability for various types of land use, and compares areas that are immediately adjacent to one another to project changes into the future. Variations in the scale of cells in a cellular model can have significant impacts on model outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Ying|last2=Roth|first2=Andreas|last3=Yu|first3=Zhenrong|last4=Doluschitz|first4=Reiner|date=2010-08-01|title=The impact of variation in scale on the behavior of a cellular automata used for land use change modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971510000244|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|volume=34|issue=5|pages=400–408|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2010.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sector-based &amp; spatially disaggregated economic models ===
Economic models are built on principles of [[supply and demand]]. They use mathematical parameters in order to predict what land types will be desired and which will be discarded. These are frequently built for urban areas, such as a 2003 study of the highly dense [[Pearl River Delta]] in southern [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seto|first=Karen C.|last2=Kaufmann|first2=Robert K.|date=2003-02-01|title=Modeling the Drivers of Urban Land Use Change in the Pearl River Delta, China: Integrating Remote Sensing with Socioeconomic Data|url=http://le.uwpress.org/content/79/1/106|journal=Land Economics|language=en|volume=79|issue=1|pages=106–121|doi=10.2307/3147108|issn=0023-7639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agent-based models ===
Agent-based models try to simulate the behavior of many individuals making independent choices, and then see how those choices affect the landscape as a whole. Agent-based modeling can be complex - for instance, a 2005 study combined an agent-based model with computer-based [[genetic programming]] to explore land change in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatan peninsula]] of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manson|first=Steven M.|date=2005-12-01|title=Agent-based modeling and genetic programming for modeling land change in the Southern Yucatán Peninsular Region of Mexico|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880905002422|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=111|issue=1–4|pages=47–62|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2005.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid approaches ===
Many models do not limit themselves to one of the approaches above - they may combine several in order to develop a fully comprehensive and accurate model.

== Implementation opportunities for land change modeling ==

Scientists use LCMs to build and test theories in land change modeling for a variety of human and environmental dynamics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=500 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20001|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land change modeling has a variety of implementation opportunities in many science and practice disciplines, such as in decision-making, policy, and in real-world application in public and private domains. The science disciplines use LCMs to formalize and test land change theory, and the explore and experiment with different scenarios of land change modeling. The practical disciplines use LCMs to analyze current land change trends and explore future outcomes from policies or actions in order to set appropriate guidelines, limits and principles for policy and action. Research and practitioner communities may study land change to address topics related to land-climate interactions, water quantity and quality, food and fiber production, and urbanization, infrastructure, and the built environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Improvement and advancement of land change modeling ==

=== Improved land observational strategies ===
[[File:Markham-suburbs aerial-edit2.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography can be used in conjunction with satellite imagery and ground data to improve land change models.]]
One improvement for land change modeling can be made through better data and integration with available data and models. Improved observational data can influence modeling quality. Finer spatial and temporal resolution data that can integrate with [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and biogeophysical data can help land change modeling couple the socioeconomic and biogeological modeling types. Land change modelers should value data at finer scales. Fine data can give a better conceptual understanding of underlying constructs of the model and capture additional dimensions of land use. It is important to maintain the temporal and spatial continuity of data from airborne-based and survey-based observation through constellations of smaller satellite coverage, image processing algorithms, and other new data to link [[Satellite imagery|satellite-based]] land use information and land management information. It is also important to have better information on land change actors and their beliefs, preferences, and behaviors to improve the predictive ability of models and evaluate the consequences of alternative policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel|date=October 2013|title=Opportunities to improve impact, integration, and evaluation of land change models|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2013.07.012|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=5|pages=452–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aligning model choices with model goals ===
One important improvement for land change modeling can be made though better aligning model choices with model goals. It is important to choose the appropriate modeling approach based on the scientific and application contexts of the specific study of interest. For example, when someone needs to design a model with policy and policy actors in mind, they may choose an agent-based model. Here, structural economic or agent-based approaches are useful, but specific patterns and trends in land change as with many ecological systems may not be as useful. When one needs to grasp the early stages of problem identification, and thus needs to understand the scientific patterns and trend of land change, machine learning and cellular approaches are useful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrating positive and normative approaches ===
Land Change Modeling should also better integrate positive and normative approaches to explanation and prediction based on evidence-based accounts of land systems. It should also integrate optimization approaches to explore the outcomes that are the most beneficial and the processes that might produce those outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrating across scales ===
It is important to better integrate data across scales. A models design is based on the dominant processes and data from a specific scale of application and spatial extent. Cross-scale dynamics and feedbacks between temporal and spatial scales influences the patterns and processes of the model. Process like tele-coupling, indirect land use change, and adaption to climate change at multiple scales requires better representation by cross-scale dynamics. Implementing these processes will require a better understanding of feedback mechanisms across scales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Opportunities in research infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure support ===
As there is continuous reinvention of modeling environments, frameworks, and platforms, land change modeling can improve from better research infrastructure support. For example, model and [[Software development process|software infrastructure development]] can help avoid duplication of initiatives by land change modeling community members, co-learn about land change modeling, and integrate models to evaluate impacts of land change. Better data infrastructure can provide more data resources to support compilation, curation, and comparison of heterogeneous data sources. Better community modeling and governance can advance decision-making and modeling capabilities within a community with specific and achievable goals. Community modeling and [[Community government|governance]] would provide a step towards reaching community agreement on specific goals to move modeling and data capabilities forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of modern challenges in land change modeling can potentially be addressed through contemporary advances in cyberinfrastructure such as crowd-source, “mining” for distributed data, and improving [[High Performance Computing|high-performance computing]]. Because it is important for modelers to find more data to better construct, calibrate, and validate structural models, the ability to analyze large amount of data on individual behaviors is helpful. For example, modelers can find point-of-sales data on individual purchases by consumers and internet activities that reveal social networks. However, some issues of privacy and propriety for crowdsourcing improvements have not yet been resolved.

The land change modeling community can also benefit from Global Positioning System and Internet-enabled mobile device data distribution. Combining various structural-based data-collecting methods can improve the availability of microdata and the diversity of people that see the findings and outcomes of land change modeling projects. For example, [[Crowdsourcing|citizen-contributed data]] supported the implementation of [[Ushahidi]] in [[Haiti]] after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], helping at least 4,000 disaster events. Universities, non-profit agencies, and volunteers are needed to collect information on events like this to make positive outcomes and improvements in land change modeling and land change modeling applications. Tools such as mobile devices are available to make it easier for participants to participate in collecting micro-data on agents. [[Google Maps]] uses cloud-based mapping technologies with datasets that are co-produced by the public and scientists. Examples in agriculture such as coffee farmers in Avaaj Otalo showed use of mobile phones for collecting information and as an interactive voice.

Cyberinfrastructure developments may also increase the ability of land change modeling to meet computational demands of various modeling approaches given increasing data volumes and certain expected model interactions. For example, improving the development of processors, data storage, network bandwidth, and coupling land change and environmental process models at high resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=90–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model evaluation ===
An additional way to improve land change modeling is through improvement of [[Evaluation|model evaluation]] approaches. Improvement in [[sensitivity analysis]] is needed to gain a better understand of the variation in model output in response to model elements like input data, model parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and model structure. Improvement in [[Pattern recognition|pattern validation]] can help land change modelers make comparisons between model outputs parameterized for some historic case, like maps, and observations for that case. Improvement in uncertainty sources is needed to improve forecasting of future states that are non-stationary in processes, input variables, and boundary conditions. One can explicitly recognize stationarity assumptions and explore data for evidence in non-stationarity to better acknowledge and understand model uncertainty to improve uncertainty sources. Improvement in structural validation can help improve acknowledgement and understanding of the processes in the model and the processes operating in the real world through a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This is a list of [[Catholic]] churchmen&lt;ref&gt;This list includes priests, bishops (including popes), deacons, monks, abbots, and those who received minor orders in the Church&lt;/ref&gt; throughout history who have made contributions to science. These churchmen-scientists include [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Georges Lemaître]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], [[Nicole Oresme]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Christopher Clavius]], [[Nicolas Steno]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], [[William of Ockham]], and others listed below. The Catholic Church has also produced many [[List of Catholic scientists|lay scientists and mathematicians]].

The [[Jesuits]] in particular have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and [[seismology]] has been described as "the Jesuit science."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elizabeth Hough, ''Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man'', Princeton University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0691128073}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvmDeAxEiO8C&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Woods|2005|p=109}} The Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century."{{Sfn|Lindberg|Numbers|1986|p=154}} According to [[Jonathan Wright (historian)|Jonathan Wright]] in his book ''God's Soldiers'', by the eighteenth century the Jesuits had "contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes, to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics and electricity. They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on [[Jupiter]]’s surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn’s rings. They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon effected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light."{{Sfn|Wright|2004|p=200}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Cuculiformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is incomprehensive, as not all Cuculiformes have had their numbers quantified.

[[File:IBM 526 Printing Summary Punch.JPG|thumb|IBM 526 Printing Summary Punch, ca. 1948, with French keyboard layout]]

The following is a partial list of products, services, and subsidiaries of [[International Business Machines|International Business Machines (IBM)]] Corporation and its predecessor corporations, beginning in the 1890s. 

This list is [[wikt:eclectic|eclectic]]; it includes, for example, the ''[[AN/FSQ-7]]'', which was not a product in the sense of ''offered for sale'', but was a product in the sense of ''manufactured—produced by the labor of IBM''. Several machines manufactured for the Astronomical Computing Bureau at Columbia University are included, as are some machines built only as demonstrations of IBM technology. Missing are [[RPQ]]s, [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] products (semiconductors, for example), and supplies (punched cards, for example). These products and others are missing simply because no one has added them.

IBM sometimes uses the same number for a system and for the principal component of that system. For example, the [[IBM 604]] Calculating Unit is a component of the [[IBM 604]] Calculating Punch. And different IBM divisions used the same model numbers; for example ''IBM 01'' without context clues could be a reference to a keypunch or to IBM's first electric typewriter.

Number sequence may not correspond to product development sequence. For example, the 402 tabulator was an improved, modernized, 405.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bashe | first = Charles J. | title = IBM's Early Computers | publisher = MIT |page=70 | year = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

IBM uses two naming structures for its modern hardware products. Products are normally given a three- or four-digit machine type and a model number (can be a mix of letters and numbers). A product may also have a marketing or brand name. For instance, 2107 is the machine type for the IBM System Storage DS8000. While the majority of products are listed here by machine type, there are instances where only a marketing or brand name is used. Care should be taken when searching for a particular product as sometimes the type and model numbers overlap. For instance the IBM storage product known as the [[IBM Enterprise Storage Server|Enterprise Storage Server]] is machine type 2105, and the IBM printing product known as the IBM Infoprint 2105 is machine type 2705, so searching for an [[IBM 2105]] could result in two different products—or the wrong product—being found.

IBM introduced the 80-column rectangular hole punched card in 1928. Pre-1928 machine models that continued in production with the new 80-column card format had the same model number as before. Machines manufactured prior to 1928 were, in some cases, [[Keypunch#Hollerith and IBM keypunches, 1890 through 1930s|retrofitted with 80-column card readers and/or punches]] thus there existed machines with pre-1928 dates of manufacture that contain 1928 technology.

This list is organized by classifications of both machines and applications, rather than by product name. Thus some (few) entries will be duplicated. The 1420, for example, is listed both as a member of the 1401 family and as a machine for Bank and finance.

IBM product names have varied over the years; for example these two texts both reference the same product.
* Mechanical Key Punch, Type 1 (in Machine Methods of Accounting, IBM, 1936)
* Mechanical Punch, Type 001 (in IBM Electric Punched Card Accounting Machines: Principles of Operation, IBM, 1946)
This article uses the name, or combination of names, most descriptive of the product. Thus the entry for the above is  
* IBM 001: Mechanical Key Punch

Products of [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company|The Tabulating Machine Company]] can be identified by date, before 1933 when the subsidiaries were merged into IBM.

===Keypunches and verifiers===

* [[Keypunch|Hollerith Keyboard (pantograph) punch]]: Manual card punch, 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Truesdell | first = Leon E. | title = The Development of Punch Card Tabulation in the Bureau of the Census 1890-1940 | publisher = US GPO | year = 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---- * [[IBM 002]]: Port-a-punch *** The Poulsen list (in references below) is the only known source identifying the IBM Port-A-Punch as "IBM 002".  While not disputing that claim, it seems odd for 002 to not have been assigned in the same time period as 001 (1910) and 003 (1920).  It is likely the case that Port-A-Punch was a supplies division product and thus, even if numbered, even if the number was 002—that number is not part of the data processing division numbering and is best omitted from this list.  Port-A-Punch is listed by name as the last entry in this section. -----&gt;

Some software listings are for software families, not products (''Fortran'' was not a product; ''Fortran H'' was a product).

Some IBM software products were distributed free (no charge for the software itself, a common practice early in the industry). The term "Program Product" was used by IBM to denote that it's freely available&lt;ref&gt;Unlike a [[Request price quotation |PRPQ]].&lt;/ref&gt; but not for free.&lt;ref name="unbundling-announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2014/06/102712825/102712825-05-01-acc.pdf|title=IBM Announcement of Program Products/SHARE 1969|date=June 23, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to June 1969, the majority of software packages written by IBM were available at no charge to IBM customers; with the June 1969 announcement, new software not designated as "System Control Programming" became Program Products, although existing non-system software remained available for free.&lt;ref name="unbundling-announcement"/&gt;

In mathematics, the terms '''continuity''', '''continuous''', and '''continuum''' are used in a variety of related ways.

== Continuity of functions and measures ==

* [[Continuous function]].
* [[Absolute continuity|Absolutely continuous function]].
* [[Absolute continuity#Absolute continuity of measures|Absolute continuity of a measure with respect to another measure]].
* [[Continuous probability distribution]].  Sometimes this term is used to mean a probability distribution whose [[cumulative distribution function]] (c.d.f.) is (simply) continuous.  Sometimes it has a less inclusive meaning: a distribution whose c.d.f. is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]].  This less inclusive sense is equivalent to the condition that every set whose Lebesgue measure is 0 has probability&amp;nbsp;0.

== Continuum ==

* [[Continuum (set theory)]], the [[real line]] or the corresponding cardinal number.
* [[Linear continuum]], any ordered set that shares certain properties of the real line.
* [[Continuum (topology)]], a nonempty compact connected [[metric space]] (sometimes a [[Hausdorff space]]).
* [[Continuum hypothesis]], a conjecture of Georg Cantor that there is no cardinal number between that of countably infinite sets and the cardinality of the set of all real numbers.  The latter cardinality is equal to the cardinality of the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set.
* [[Cardinality of the continuum]], a cardinal number that represents the size of the set of real numbers.

The '''matrix of domination''' or '''matrix of oppression''' is a sociological paradigm that explains issues of oppression that deal with [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and [[gender]], which, though recognized as different social classifications, are all interconnected. Other forms of classification, such as [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], or [[ageing|age]], apply to this theory as well. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] is credited with introducing the theory in her work entitled ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/252.html|title=Patricia Hill Collins, Black Feminist Thought in the Matrix of  	Domination|website=www.hartford-hwp.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
As the term implies, there are many different ways one might experience domination, facing many different challenges in which one obstacle, such as race, may overlap with other sociological features.  Characteristics such as race, age, and sex, may affect an individual in extremely different ways, in such simple cases as varying geography, socioeconomic status, or simply throughout time. Other scholars such as Kimberle Crenshaw's ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color'' are credited with expanding Collins' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=1991|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color |journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination is a way for people to acknowledge their privileges in society. How one is able to interact, what social groups on is in, and the networks one establishes is all based on different interconnected classifications.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wmst.gmu.edu/center/publications|title=Publications|work=Women and Gender Studies|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory applied ==
Though Collins' main focus of the theory of the matrix of domination was applied to [[African-American women]], there are many other examples that can be used to illustrate the theory. Other examples include [[Log Cabin Republicans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Mary F.|last2=Lott|first2=Phillip B.|date=1997|title=Backlash, the Matrix of Domination, and Log Cabin Republicans|jstor=4121156|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|pages=497–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; female criminality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernard|first=April|date=May 15, 2012|title=The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1557085112445304|journal=Feminist Criminology|volume=8|pages=3–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American Muslim Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byng|first=Michelle D.|date=1998|title=Mediating Discrimination: Resisting Oppression among African-American Muslim Women |journal=Social Problems|volume=45|issue=4|pages=473–487|doi=10.2307/3097208}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key concepts of the matrix of domination is that the different categories, like race and gender, are separate groups, rather than a combination. This is a problem that can be seen in the law as well when it comes to discrimination because the courts fail to view discrimination as an overarching umbrella of intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cousins|first1=Oswald B.|title=The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective|date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A way in which the Matrix of Domination works with regards to privilege can be if two people all have the same classification, except one person has an education and one does not have as high of an education. Their gender, race, sexuality, educational attainment all intersect to identify who they are. However, compared to other people one classification can point out privilege and, in turn, open more opportunities for one individual over the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the main aspects of the matrix of domination is the fact that one may be privileged in one area, yet they can be oppressed in a different aspect of their identity. Some people believe that racial discrimination is on its way to being eradicated from the United States when they look as people like Colin Powell, a very successful, African-American, middle-aged man. Although Powell obtains the characteristics of a person that may not face oppression (upper-class, middle-aged, male), he is still discriminated against because of his race. This shows one of the key components of the matrix of domination; the idea that one cannot look at the individual facets of someone's identity, but rather that they are all interconnected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rampages.us/oliviapryor/tag/matrix-of-domination/|title=matrix of domination {{!}} A so-sociologist|website=rampages.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Matrix of Domination Compared to Intersectionality ==

=== Historical Background on the Matrix of Domination ===
In Collins’ ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment'', she first describes the concept of matrix thinking within the context of how black women in America encounter institutional discrimination based upon their race and gender.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill. (2000) ''Black Feminist Thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment''. New York, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example of this in the 1990s was racial segregation, especially as it related to housing, education, and employment. At the time, there was very little encouraged interaction between whites and blacks in these common sectors of society. Collins argues that this demonstrates how being black and female in America continues to perpetuate certain common experiences for African-American women. As such, African-American women live in a different world than those who are not black and female.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Collins notes how this shared social struggle can actually result in the formation of a group-based collective effort, citing how the high concentration of African-American women in the domestic labor sector in combination with racial segregation in housing and schooling contributed directly to the organization of the black feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The collective wisdom shared by black women that held these specific experiences constituted a distinct viewpoint for African-American women concerning correlations between their race and gender and the resulting economic consequences.

Moolman points out the main issue concerning matrix thinking is how one accounts for the power dynamics between varying identifying categories that are ingrained in both oppression and domination instead of the traditional approach, reducing experiences to a single identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14725843.2013.775843|title=Rethinking ‘masculinities in transition’ in South Africa considering the ‘intersectionality’ of race, class, and sexuality with gender|last=Moolman|first=Benita|date=2013|website=tandfonline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, black women’s experiences with society are used to illustrate how even though white scholars have attempted to use intersectionality in their research, they may still be inclined to default towards single-identity thinking that often fails to address all aspects of black women’s experiences, thus ignoring the organization the matrix objectively offers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281204860_Pursuing_Intersectionality_Unsettling_Dominant_Imaginaries|title=Pursuing Intersectionality, Unsettling Dominant Imaginaries|last=May|first=Vivian|date=2015-01-01|isbn=9780415808408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matrix of domination in the colonial era and white society has also been carefully examined. The societal hierarchy determined by race and implemented under apartheid locates different racial populations in regards to their privilege, with African Americans usually at the bottom of the ladder. Dhamoon argues that on a global scale, the spot occupied by African Americans in such context is interchangeable with indigenous populations, as marginalized peoples are systematically working both within and across a matrix of interrelated axes of “penalty and privilege”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feralfeminisms.com/rita-dhamoon/|title=feral feminisms » A FEMINIST APPROACH TO DECOLONIZING ANTI-RACISM: RETHINKING TRANSNATIONALISM, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND SETTLER COLONIALISM|website=www.feralfeminisms.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interconnectivity of different identities in regards to power in racial structures in post-colonial era societies help illustrate what changes make a difference. The framework setup of the matrix of domination connects its origin theory and thought to existing struggles in the political and social spheres of society. A closer look at both specific and broader aspects of matrix thought will shed more light on the inner-workings and mechanisms that determine how different relationship dynamics influence matrix categorizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

May cites that an important implication that matrix thinking inspires is that it directly goes against what is often described as the socially inclusive ‘add and stir’ approach.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This is often used when describing the addition of one or more identity group to existing epistemological approaches, political strategies or research methodologies. This accounts for the proper weighing of power dynamics and their impact on different groups of people. Intersectionality centers power in a multi-pronged way as shifting across different sites and scales at the same time. Therefore, it is not neutral but evolved out of histories of struggle that pursue multidimensional forms of justice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Historical Background on Intersectionality ===
[[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberlé Crenshaw]], the founder of the term [[intersectionality]], brought national and scholarly credential to the term through the paper ''Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics'' in The University of Chicago Legal Forum.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=uclf|journal=Chicago Unbound|volume=|pages=139–167|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, she uses intersectionality to reveal how feminist movements and antiracist movements exclude and women of color.  Focusing on the experiences of Black women, she dissects several court cases, influential pieces of literature, personal experiences, and doctrinal manifestations as evidence for the way Black women are oppressed through many different experiences, systems and groups.

Though the specifics differ, the basic argument is the same: Black women are oppressed in a multitude of situations because people are unable to see how their identities intersect and influence each other. Feminism has been crafted for white middle class women, only considering problems that affect this group of people. Unfortunately, this only captures a small facet of the oppression women face. By catering to the most privileged women and addressing only the problems they face, feminism alienates women of color and lower class women by refusing to accept the way other forms of oppression feed into the sexism they face. Not only does feminism completely disregard the experiences of women of color, it also solidifies the connection between womanhood and whiteness when feminists speak for “all women”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; (Crenshaw:154) Oppression cannot be detangled or separated easily in the same way identities cannot be separated easily. It is impossible to address the problem of sexism without addressing racism, as many women experience both racism and sexism. This theory can also be applied to the antiracist movement, which rarely addresses the problem of sexism, even though it is thoroughly intertwined with the problem of racism. Feminism remains white, and antiracism remains male. In essence, any theory that tries to measure the extent and manner of oppression Black women face will be wholly incorrect without using intersectionality.

Patricia Hill Collins wrote a book entitled ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment'', which articulated "Black Feminist Thought" in relation to  intersectionality with a focus on the plight of Black women in face of the world, the white feminist movement, and the male antiracism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins references Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality and relates it to the matrix of domination, "The term matrix of domination describes this overall social organization within which intersecting oppressions originate, develop, and are contained.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality and the Matrix of Domination ===
Both intersectionality and the matrix of domination help sociologists understand power relationships and systems of oppression in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gouws|first=Amanda|date=June 2017|title=Feminist intersectionality and the matrix of domination in South Africa|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/10130950.2017.1338871?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Agenda|volume=31|pages=19–27|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination looks at the overall organization of power in society while intersectionality is used to understand a specific social location of an identity using mutually constructing features of oppression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The concept of intersectionality today is used to move away from one dimensional thinking in the matrix of domination approach by allowing for different power dynamics of different identity categories at the same time.  Researchers in public health are using Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) Framework to show how social categories intersect to identify health disparities that evolve from factors beyond an individual’s personal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowleg|first=L.|date=2012|title=The Problem With the Phrase Women and Minorities: Intersectionality - an Important Theoretical Framework for Public Health|url=http://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300750|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102 |issue=7|pages=1267–1273|via=DOI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferlatte applied an IBPA framework and used structural interviews to identify barriers to the allocation of HIV prevention funding for gay men. He highlighted policy more likely to cause harm than reduce the epidemic stemming from policy makers missing the ‘intersections of oppression, sex panic, and medicalization’.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlatte, Olivier. (2012). Are There Enough Gay Dollars? An Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis of HIV Prevention Funding for Gay Men in British Columbia, Canada. 189-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersectionality can also be used to correct for the over-attribution of traits to groups and be used to emphasize unique experiences within a group. As a result, the field of social work is introducing intersectional approaches in their research and client interactions. At the University of Arkansas, the curriculum for a Master of Social Work (MSW) is being amended to include the Multi-Systems Life Course (MSLC) approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy-Erby|first=Yvette|last2=Christy-McMullin|first2=Kameri|last3=Stuass|first3=Kimberly|last4=Schriver|first4=Joe|date=August 2010|title=Multi-Systems Life Course: A New Practice Perspective and Its Application in Advanced Practice with Racial and Ethnic Populations|url=|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=20|pages=672–687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christy and Valandra apply an MSLC approach to intimate partner violence and economic abuse against poor women of color to explain that symbols of safety (such as police) in one population can be symbols of oppression in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christy|first=Kameri|last2=Valandra|first2=Dr.|date=September 2017|title=A Multi-Systems Life Course Perspective of Economic Abuse|url=|journal=Advances in Social Work|volume=18, No. 1|issue=Special Issue: Trauma-Informed Practice|pages=80–102|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; By teaching this approach to future social workers, the default recommendation for these women to file a police report is amended and an intervention rooted in the individual case can emerge.

== Implications of the Matrix of Domination ==
Many approaches have been used that consider the concepts of identity, societal structures, and representation to be mutually exclusive, but the introduction of Patricia Hill Collins’ matrix of domination addresses the interlocking patterns of privilege and marginalization along the lines of race, class, gender, and class inside social institutions as well as at the community level.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winker|first=Gabriele|last2=Degele|first2=Nina|date=2011|title=Intersectionality as multi-level analysis: Dealing with social inequality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350506810386084|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=18|pages=51–66|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this work has come greater recognition of the various effects that each identity holds in different societal contexts, in both the micro- and macro-level structures within the systems of oppression that exist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== In Female Criminality ===
In April Bernard's article, “The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality”, Bernard applies Patricia Hill Collins’ work to the study of feminist criminology, as a means of explaining the cumulative effects of identity in a system of oppression on women’s decisions to commit a crime.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernard|first=April|date=2013|title=The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality|url=|journal=Feminist Criminology|volume=8|pages=3–19|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard employs an intersectional approach to dissect the complexities that act as determinant factors in a woman’s decision to partake in criminal activities, and more specifically, the limiting pressures of a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In particular, this article is framed in response to Robert Merton’s claims about deviance as a response to a lack of adequate resources to achieve cultural goals, as Bernard employs an intersectional paradigm model that explores female criminality as an expression of constraint and circumscription, rather than a “strained reality”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With this alternative framework, Bernard suggests that societal goals are not unanimous, and are instead shaped by individuals’ experiences in economic, political, and social spaces; for marginalized women, access to the means through which they build success are impacted by micro- and macro-level norms and histories that have created indicators of class (e.g. racial, economic, political, sexual) and subjugated them to limited networks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, identity makes women with marginalized identities more vulnerable in the legal system, subjugates to oppressive states within multiple institutions, and creating a need for policies that move toward creating an equitable reality for them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== In the Welfare State ===
In the United States, especially, the matrix of domination has implications within the welfare state. Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics, Gender, and Concepts|last=Mazur|first=Amy G.|last2=Goertz|first2=Gary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521897761|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In “''Politics, Gender, and Concepts''”, Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race. As such, using the idea of a matrix of domination in these kinds of studies provides a basis for empirical research on the relationship between social positions and policies, and also, for a comparison between the outcomes of social policies on marginalized and privileged women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Intersectionality of Gender and Class ==

=== Benefits Among Class ===

The benefits that upper-class citizens receive from their employer are far different from that of working-class employees. This is due to the upper class taking jobs that give them a higher status or position, whereas the working class take jobs with lower status such as retail and blue-collar jobs.&lt;ref name="Pacific Standard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/economics/work-life-balance-benefits-low-wage-workers-employers-35733.|title=Work-Life Balance Benefits Low-Wage Workers, Employers|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious benefit that differs between classes is the amount of money made. Upper-class workers receive significantly more pay than the working class, and while the upper class receive salaries, the lower class typically receive their pay based off hourly wages.&lt;ref name="Pacific Standard"/&gt; Moreover, the chance of getting a raise is greater for the higher-ups. More benefits that the upper class enjoy over the working class are vacation time, flexible hours, retirement savings, and greater coverage of healthcare and insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://workingclassstudies.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/who-is-working-class/|title=Who is working class?|date=2008-07-28|work=Working-Class Perspectives|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits Among Gender ===

When it comes to workplace benefits such as health insurance coverage, pensions, sick leave, and disability plans, there are gender differences in whether or not these benefits are offered. Women are less likely to be offered pensions, health coverage and disability plans. In fact, high poverty rates among elderly women have been linked to lack of pension coverage. Additionally, many female heads of household remain on welfare because they cannot find jobs with adequate health insurance coverage. When it comes to union contracts, men are also twice as likely to be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3386/w4265 |title=Gender Gaps in Benefits Coverage |last=Currie |first=Janet |date=January 1993 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 4265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gender gap in benefits coverage may be due to the fact that women tend to have higher medical expenditures than males of the same age. As a result, some of the observed gap in wages between males and females in the United States could be the result of employers compensating for the higher cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. This further perpetuates gender discrimination because it means that firms who offer ESI (Employer Sponsored Insurance) will prefer to hire males. Another effect of women generally having greater healthcare expenses than men is that they are likely to place a higher value on insurance and be more inclined to pass up jobs for insurance-related reasons. This lowers the probability of obtaining jobs that pay higher wages directly and decrease a woman's bargaining power with her current employer. Indeed, health insurance has a larger (negative) effect on the job mobility of women, which they attribute to women's elevated healthcare expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=Employer-sponsored health insurance and the gender wage gap |journal=Journal of Health Economics|language=en|volume=45|pages=103–114|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.09.008|issn=0167-6296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage Gap Among Class ===

In the United States there is an unequal distribution of income between social classes for multiple reasons. Level of education has a great influence on average salaries. The higher the socioeconomic status (SES) of an individual the more likely they are to graduate from high school and potentially obtain a college degree, which in return increases their chances of a larger salary. The average salary of an individual with a high school diploma is about $35,000, but increases to about $60,000 by obtaining a bachelor's degree after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-education-level|title=The Average Salary by Education Level - SmartAsset|website=SmartAsset|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap in salary increases with each additional level of education received. Those in the lower class face more obstacles and have less opportunities to pursue additional education due to their lack of resources. The wage gap is even larger for individuals affected by poverty and racial barriers. Whites have a median income of about $71,000 while blacks have a median income of about $43,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/|title=1. Demographic trends and economic well-being|date=2016-06-27|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that blacks make up 16% of public high school graduates, 14% of those enrolling in college, and only 9% of those receiving a bachelor's degree. At the same time, whites make up 59%, 58%, and 69%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/24/more-hispanics-blacks-enrolling-in-college-but-lag-in-bachelors-degrees/|title=More Hispanics, blacks enrolling in college, but lag in bachelor’s degrees|date=2014-04-24|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is a 61% difference between blacks not obtaining a bachelor's degree and whites graduating with one. Individuals in poverty already face a disadvantage in obtaining the same level of income as their upper class coworkers, but when also affected by racial barriers the chances of reaching the same income are even fewer.

=== Wage Gap Among Gender ===

There is definitely intersectionality and inequality with women and men when it comes to wage gaps. Careers that pay well are often male dominated, and do not tolerate women and their personal needs. There has been a stable “pay gap” between men and women which has remained between 10-20% difference in their average earnings. (Women, careers and work life preferences).  When discussing wage gaps between genders, scientists takes into account two questions, the first being “is there differential access jobs on the basis of gender?” and the second being, “ is women’s work perceived to have less value than comparable work done by men?”.  When women begin to increase their numbers in certain job positions the status or value of the job decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|date=18 January 2017|title=Women, careers, and work-life preferences|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03069880600769118|journal=Taylor Francis Online|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualizing intersectionality through class, gender and race then identifying the barriers that create inequality in Work organizations is found in the idea of “inequality regimes”. Workplaces are prominent locations to analyze the continuous efforts of inequalities because many societal inequality issues stem in such areas. In the works of Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations, inequality in gender, race, class are examined through intersectionality in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alksins|first=Christine|date=21 May 2008|title=Workforce Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap: Is "Women's" Work Valued as Highly as "Men's"?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00354.x|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joane Acker discussed Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations in Sociologists for Women in Society Feminists Lecture through studies conducted using Swedish Bank.

=== Representation Among Class ===

Social class plays a large role on people’s everyday life, yet their representation is not always fair. In television and popular culture, those who fall into the lower class are often portrayed differently based on if they are a woman or a man. If they are a woman, they often are portrayed as being more intelligent and responsible than their husbands, almost acting as their mothers.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The male head of the household is typically portrayed as being less intelligent, with some redeeming qualities, but typically is not respected.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/socialclass.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Social Class and Television|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they can be shown in a light that makes them seem lazy or dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Taniesha|date=October 25, 2004|title=The Development of Stereotypes About the Rich and Poor: Age, Race, and Family Income Differences in Beliefs|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108157/Stereotype%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper class however, does not face these same issues with representation in the media. The man of the household takes on stereotypical male qualities, while the woman takes on stereotypical female qualities. The children in this upper class scenario are what provides entertainment value, rather than focusing on the unintelligent and unorganized adults as in the lower class model.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Overall, in the upper-class family unit, they are portrayed as organized and put together, while the lower class model are portrayed as lazy and unorganized.

=== Representation Among Gender ===

In American society and many other societies around the world, being a largely represented group in a position of power means that one has succeeded in life. Whether one is a manager of a fast food restaurant or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, authority is power and power is advantage. But just like the widespread power struggle, there is a widespread equality struggle. One of the largest workplace and societal inequalities is the inequality between genders. A prime example of this is the wage gap. Women in 2016 earned, on average, 82 cents to a man’s dollar. This unequal pay is part of the reason that many women are the ones to leave the workforce when it is determined that a stay-at-home parent is required; if women are contributing less to the household income, it will make less of an impact if they quit their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/04/pf/equal-pay-day-gender-pay-gap/index.html|title=5 things to know about the gender pay gap|last=Vasel|first=Kathryn|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also not granted the same opportunities for employment as men. A clear example is the U.S. military. Women were banned from all combat roles until recently. In 2011, only 14 percent of the armed forces were female, and only 14 percent of officers were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/24/us/military-women-glance/index.html|title=By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military - CNN|last=Staff|first=By CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the U.S. congress. In 2015, 80 percent of the Senate was male, and only 20 was female. This numbers were similar for the House, at 80.6 percent male and 19.4 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/|title=The new Congress is 80 percent white, 80 percent male and 92 percent Christian|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=2015-01-05|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender composition of the military and the government, along with the wage gap, shines a lights on the gender inequality experienced right here at home, but this inequality is more greatly felt abroad. Some countries place strict limitations on women, not allowing them to vote or work or even drive a car. While the U.S. is seen as a country of dreams and opportunity, is far easier to see this when compared to an even more unequal country. The United States has been trending toward gender equality in recent years, but it has a while to go.

=== Research contributions ===

An article found in the November 1998 issue of ''Social Problems'' details the conflict involving racial domination by identifying the complexity African-Americans face.  In many cases, sociologists and laypersons alike are often limited in their approach to the problem.  Michelle Byng, in "Mediating Discrimination: Oppression among African-American Muslim Women"—the 1998 article—brings to focus new approaches to understanding discrimination, but also, she writes to illustrate the many overlooked opportunities in which the discriminated are able to empower themselves in certain situations.

==Intersectionality in Court Cases==
There are countless numbers of court cases that examine intersectionality within the workforce that did not allow individuals to have equal opportunities because of their race, gender, and social class.

The case, '''DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors''', provides an example when the law does an injustice to those that face discrimination. Five black female production workers were laid off, and took it to court claiming that the company was violating [[Title VII]] because, "it perpetrated past discriminatory practices of not hiring Black females." The court looked at each of the categories, race and gender, separately therefore they missed the discrimination of a person being both African-American and female. "It was argued, black women can expect little protection as long as approaches, such as that in DeGraffenreid, which completely obscure problems of intersectionality prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, Oswald B. (November 10, 2017). "The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case, '''Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai'i''', where intersectionality was the core reason behind the problem that emerged. Maivan Lam was not offered a job twice when she applied to be the Director of the Law School's Pacific Asian Legal Studies Program. Two times, the university was looking for a director and when the final offer came around, and she was the best candidate available, the university simply cancelled their search. In the first search, Professor Lam made it to the final round, but was not offered the job before the whole search was simply shut down. The second time, the position was offered to another candidate and the other candidate refused to accept, the search was simply cancelled without it being offered to Professor Lam. When Lam brought this situation up to the Dean, he suggested reopening the search so that male candidates who had not applied on time could submit their applications. It is stated, "Early in the 1989-90 academic year, the new appointments committee reviewed applications for a commercial law position. At one meeting, a male committee member stated that the Law School should not have two women teaching commercial law. This comment was reported to the Dean, who said that he recognized that the professor had difficulty dealing with women but took no action to remove him from the committee or otherwise to remedy the problem.".&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i, 1994, Maivan Lam, Plaintiff-appellant, v. University of Hawai'i; Albert Simone, in His Capacity Aspresident of the University of Hawai'i; Andjeremy Harrison, in His Capacity As Deanof the Richardson School Oflaw, Defendants-appellees, 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; There was clear intersectionality as Professor Lam was not only arguing regards to race but also how her gender affected her position.

In the case, '''Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Association''', April 21, 1980, Dafro M. Jefferies claimed that her former employer failed to promote her to a higher position because of her race and sex. In 1967 she was employed by Harris County Community Action Association as a Secretary to the Director of Programs. She was later promoted to Personal Interviewer in 1970. Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction for her. However, between 1971 and April 1974, Jefferies applied for promotions in various positions and departments without any luck. She realized that her employer was discriminating against her when two Field Representative positions opened. Jefferies immediately applied. However, the positions were already staffed by a white female and black male the same day that she was told about the vacant position. The company had purposefully told her about the open positions knowing that they were already filled by other staff members. After several complaints to the company, on April 23, 1974 Jefferies was placed on probation. In June 1974, she was terminated from the job because she had called the company out for discriminating against her because of her race and sex. There was clear evidence of intersectionality in this case; Jefferies was not promoted to a higher position because she was both black and a female.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28343">The '''Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment''' ('''MDVE''') evaluated the effectiveness of various [[police]] responses to [[domestic violence]] calls in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. This experiment was implemented during 1981-82 by [[Lawrence W. Sherman]], Director of Research at the [[Police Foundation]], and by the [[Minneapolis Police Department]] with funding support from the [[National Institute of Justice]].&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

The results of the study, showing a deterrent effect for arrest, had a "virtually unprecedented impact in changing then-current police practices."&lt;ref name="buzawa"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Buzawa, E.

Buzawa |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Domestic Violence: The Criminal Justice Response|publisher=Sage|year=1990 |pages=94–99|isbn=0-7619-2448-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, numerous states and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] enacted policies for mandatory [[arrest]], without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], for domestic violence cases in which the responding police officer had [[probable cause]] that a crime had occurred.

==Background==
Domestic violence historically has been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve government or [[criminal justice]] intervention.&lt;ref name="fagan1995"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf |title=Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits|author=Fagan, Jeffrey|conference=Conference on Criminal Justice Research and Evaluation|year=1995|booktitle=Research Report|publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the early 1970s, [[Policing in the United States|police in the United States]] favored a "hands-off" approach to domestic violence calls, with arrest only used as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Training Key 16: Handling Disturbance Calls|author= International Association of Chiefs of Police|publisher=International Association of Chiefs of Police|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parnas, Raymond I.|year=1967|title=The Police Response to the Domestic Disturbance|journal=Wisconsin Law Review|volume=31|pages=914–960}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, domestic violence cases were typically classified as [[misdemeanor]] [[assault]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Buzawa, Eve S.  |author2=Carl G. Buzawa  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Traditional and Innovative Police Responses to Domestic Violence |title=Critical Issues in Policing |editor=Dunham, Roger G. |editor2=Geoffrey P. Albert |publisher=Waveland Press |year=2005 |edition=5th |isbn=1-57766-352-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, many U.S. jurisdictions did not authorize the police to make arrests in any misdemeanor assault, whether it involved a domestic partner or not, unless the assault occurred in the officer's presence.  A 1978 court order in [[New York City]] mandated that arrests only be made in cases of serious violence, thus officers instead made effort to mediate family disputes.&lt;ref name="nyt-19840415"&gt;{{cite news|author=LeMoyne, James|title=A Firmer Response to Family Strife |publisher=The New York Times|date=April 15, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, [[clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] argued that police should make an effort to mediate disputes.&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"/&gt;

Statistics on incidence of domestic violence, published in the late 1970s, helped raise public awareness of the problem and increase [[activism]].&lt;ref name="fagan1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="straus1980"&gt;{{cite book |author=Straus, M., Gelles, R., &amp; Steinmetz, S. |year=1980 |title=Behind Closed Doors: Violence in the American Family |publisher=Anchor/Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1976 by the Police Foundation found that the police had intervened at least once in the previous two years in 85 percent of spouse [[homicide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Police Foundation|year=1976|title=Domestic Violence and the Police: Studies in Detroit and Kansas City|publisher=The Police Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminism|feminists]] and battered women's advocacy groups were calling on police to take domestic violence more seriously and change intervention strategies.&lt;ref name="gelles1993"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0002764293036005003|author=Gelles, Richard J.|title=Constraints against family violence: how well do they work?|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=36|date=May–June 1993|pages=575–587 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, these groups took legal action against police departments, including in [[Oakland, California]] and New York City, to get them to make arrests in domestic violence cases.&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"/&gt; They claimed that police assigned low priority to domestic disturbance calls.&lt;ref&gt;Straus (1980), and references below, "Criticism of police response"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] published a report, ''Deterrence and Incapacitation: Estimating the Effects of Criminal Sanctions on Crime Rates'', which called for more rigorous assessments of policies and practices based on [[social control theory|social control]] theories and use of [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]] for crime control.&lt;ref name="buzawa"/&gt;  Based on the Academy's recommendations, the National Institute of Justice began funding studies of the deterrent effects of criminal sanctions and, in 1980, one of the sponsored studies was the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment.

==The study==

===Methodology===
The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment looked at effectiveness of methods used by police to reduce domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crim.upenn.edu/aec/lsherman.htm |title=AEC Presidents: Lawrence W. Sherman |publisher=Academy of Experimental Criminologists |accessdate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602023850/http://www.crim.upenn.edu/aec/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2007-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases used in the study were [[misdemeanor]] assault calls, which make up the bulk of domestic violence [[calls for service]]. Both the victim and [[offender]] needed to still be present when the police arrived, in order to be included in the study.

51 patrol officers in the Minneapolis Police Department participated in the study.  Each was asked to use one of three approaches for handling domestic violence calls, in cases where officers had probable cause to believe an assault had occurred:
# Send the abuser away for eight hours.
# Advice and mediation of disputes.
# Make an arrest.

Interviews were conducted during a 6-month follow-up period, with both victims and offenders, as well as official records consulted to determine whether or not re-offending had occurred.  The study lasted approximately 17 months and included 330 cases.&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"/&gt;

===Findings===
Arrest was found to be the most effective police response. The study found that the offenders assigned to be arrested had lower rates of [[recidivism|re-offending]] than offenders assigned to counseling or temporarily sent away. (19% for arrest 37% for advise and 34% for Send)&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"/&gt;

==Policy response==
The results of the study received a great deal of attention from the news media, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' and prime-time news coverage on television.&lt;ref name="buzawa"/&gt; Many U.S. police departments responded to the study, adopting a mandatory arrest policy for spousal violence cases with [[probable cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elliott, Delbert S. |chapter=Criminal Justice Procedures in Family Violence Crimes |editor=Oblin, Lloyd |editor2=Michael Tonry |title=Family Violence. Crime and Justice: A Review of Research |pages=427–480 |publisher=University of Chicago |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City Police Department]] Commissioner [[Benjamin Ward]] quickly issued a new mandate for officers to make arrests, after reading the results of the study in a Police Foundation report.&lt;ref name="nyt-19840415"/&gt; Ward stated his belief that "arresting violent members of a household would be more effective in protecting other family members and help safeguard police officers called in to stop the highly charged quarrels. I thought it was about time to put policemen out of the counseling business and into what they really are best at, which is making arrests, then let the judge decide."&lt;ref name="nyt-19840415"/&gt; With this mandate, Ward also included [[cohabitation|cohabitants]] and [[homosexuality|same-sex]] couples in the police definition of family.&lt;ref name="nyt-19840415"/&gt; The [[Houston Police Department|Houston]] and [[Dallas Police Department]]s were also quick to change their approach to domestic disturbance calls, and make more arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arrest May Be Deterrent In Domestic Violence, Study Shows |publisher=Associated Press / New York Times |date=May 30, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, the number of police departments using arrest as a strategy in domestic violence cases jumped from 10 to 31%, and to 46% by 1986.&lt;ref name="buzawa"/&gt; Numerous other police departments had partially changed their approach to domestic violence cases.&lt;ref name="buzawa"/&gt;

In 1984, the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]]'s Task Force on Family Violence report drew heavily upon the Minneapolis study, in recommending that domestic violence be handled with a [[criminal justice]] approach.&lt;ref name="gelles1993"/&gt; Within eight years, 15 states and the [[District of Columbia]] enacted new domestic violence laws that required the arrest of violent domestic offenders.&lt;ref name="schmidt1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schmidt, Janell D.  |author2=Lawrence W. Sherman  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Does Arrest Deter Domestic Violence? |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |volume=36 |year=1993 |pages=601–609 |doi=10.1177/0002764293036005005 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, 23 states and the District of Columbia had enacted mandatory arrest for domestic assault, without warrant, given that the officer has probable cause and regardless of whether or not the officer witnessed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoctor, M. |title=Domestic Violence as a Crime against the State |journal=California Law Review |volume=85 |year=1997 |pages=643–700 |doi=10.2307/3481154 |jstor=3481154 |issue=3 |publisher=California Law Review, Vol. 85, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Minneapolis study also influenced policy in other countries, including [[New Zealand]], which adopted a pro-arrest policy for domestic violence cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2006/family-violence-pro-arrest-policy-literature-review/chapter-2.html |title=Family violence and the pro-arrest policy: a literature review |chapter=Historical development of the pro-arrest policy in  |publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Justice |author=Carswell, Sue |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory arrest policies==
Mandatory [[arrest]] laws were implemented in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s due, in great part, to the impact of the Minneapolis Experiment. The [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 added to the volume of [[legislation]] in the 1990s pertaining to mandatory [[arrest]] laws, affecting those states that lacked such laws themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Violence Against Women Act of 1994, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.3355.ENR:], "The Library of Congress", 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws "require the police to make arrests in domestic violence cases when there was probable cause to do so, regardless of the wishes of the victim." &lt;ref&gt;Clute, Penelope D., [http://www.correctionhistory.org/northcountry/html/knowlaw/mandatoryarrestcharges3.htm “Know the Law: Domestic Violence Mandatory Arrest”]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the laws were put into effect, [[police]] officers were required to [[witness]] the [[abuse]] occurring first hand prior to making an arrest. Currently, 23 states use mandatory arrest policies. 
&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"&gt;National Institute of Justice, [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/publications/dv-dual-arrest222679/exhibits/table1.htm “Table 1: States With Mandatory Arrest”]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states leave the decision to arrest to the discretion of the responding officers.

===History of mandatory arrest policy in the U.S.===
Prior to the implementation of mandatory arrest policies in the United States, police often were not able to arrest individuals suspected of domestic violence. In an article from the ''[[California Law Review]]'' titled "Domestic Violence as a Crime Against the State," Machaela Hoctor explained that "when officers did respond to a domestic violence call, they usually attempted to mediate the dispute. This "mediation" consisted of a variety of approaches, including attempts by officers to convince the parties to reconcile immediately at the scene or to use formal alternative dispute resolution programs."&lt;ref&gt;Hoctor, Machaela, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3481154 “Domestic Violence as a Crime Against the State”], "California Law Review", May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
The debate over mandatory arrest is still underway, as many people believe it has negative effects on the [[assailant]], victim, and their family members including but not limited to the breakdown of the family, the economic deprivation of the victim, the [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] associated with separation of families, and the lack of childcare in situations of dual arrest. Sometimes when police respond, they arrest both parties involved in a domestic violence situation. As described by Margaret Martin in the ''[[Journal of Family Violence]]'', "The practice of dual arrest, the arrest of two parties, usually a man and a woman engaged in a 'domestic dispute,' has arisen in localities which employ presumptive and mandatory arrest".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Margaret, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1w4876lx0300rn4/ “Double Your Trouble: Dual Arrest in Family Violence”], "Journal of Family Violence", 1997, Volume 12, Number 2, 139-157,&lt;/ref&gt; Police are more likely to arrest both parties if the primary [[:wikt:aggressor|aggressor]] is female &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;National Institute of Justice, [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/publications/dv-dual-arrest-222679/ch1/findings.htm#one “Domestic Violence Cases: What Research Shows about Arrest and Dual Arrest Rates”], "Office of Justice Programs"&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every [[domestic violence]] situation results in dual arrest. Police Officers are trained to deduce who the primary aggressor is in a domestic violence dispute, leading to the arrest of the [[assailant]] and not the victim.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Circumstances for arrest===
Some states will arrest simply based on [[probable cause]] to believe an act of domestic violence has been committed, while others do not allow for an arrest after a specific amount of time following the incident. For example, in [[Alaska]] the police cannot make an arrest if the abuse occurred more than 12 hours prior to notification &lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"/&gt; [[Police]] are specifically trained to assess the situation and decide whether they have the required probable cause to make an arrest. For instance, [[Wisconsin]] has a list of requirements that must be met before an officer can arrest a suspect. These include the age of the suspect(s), their relationship to the victim(s), and whether the act could be considered an intentional assault. The officer must also be able to identify the "predominant aggressor" &lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, [http://www.wcadv.org/sites/default/files/resources/Mandatory_Arrest_Checklist.pdf “Mandatory Arrest Checklist”], Published 1989, Updated 2008, Sec. 968.075, Wis. Stats&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern arrests===
Research has consistently reported an increase in the use of arrest for domestic violence in the United States.  One large (but not necessarily representative) study of over 650,000 incidents drawn from 2,819 jurisdictions in 19 states during the year 2000 found that in the 197,064 incidents when victims and offenders were intimate partners, police made one or more arrests in 48.0 percent of incidents, and dual arrests in 1.9 percent of incidents &lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Justice, [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/publications/dv-dual-arrest-222679/exhibits/ex1-victim-offender-intimate-partners.htm“Exhibit 1: Arrests by Victim-Offender Relationship: Intimate Partners”], "Office of Justice Programs"&lt;/ref&gt;
In regards to [[same-sex relationships]], the arrest rates for [[domestic violence]] were the same as those for [[heterosexual]] couples. For all [[intimate relationship|intimate]] partner relationships, offenders were more likely to be arrested if the incident of violence was a serious [[aggravated assault]]. The NIJ also reported that "arrest occurred more frequently in cases involving intimate partners if the offender was white" and "cases involving intimate partners and acquaintances were more likely to result in arrest if the offender was 21 or older".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The increased use of arrest has led to concerns about increases in arrests of women or arrests of two or more persons (dual arrests) in the same incident.

==Criticism==
The Minneapolis study was criticized for its methods and its conclusions.&lt;ref name="buzawa"/&gt; The follow-up period of six months may have been too short to capture the episodic and cyclical patterns that can occur with domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fagan, Jeffrey |title=Cessation of Family Violence: Deterrence and Dissuasion |journal=Crime and Justice: an Annual Review of Research |volume=11 |year=1989 |pages=377–425 |doi=10.1086/449158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Minneapolis may have been unusual, in that they kept arrestees overnight in [[jail]], whereas in other jurisdictions arrestees might be sent home much quicker.&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"/&gt;

While the Minneapolis design had many methodological strengths, randomized experiments look at the average [[Causality|causal effects]] for the group as a whole.  Conclusions may be made that apply to most individuals in the group, but not all individuals, with some possibly experiencing negative effects of the intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=What the Scientific Evidence Shows: On the Average, We Can Do No Better Than Arrest |author=Berk, Richard A. |title=Current Controversies on Family Violence |editor=Gelles, Richard J. |editor2=Donileen R. Loseke |publisher=Sage Publications |year=1993 |page=328 |isbn=0-8039-4674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, arrest may provoke the abuser and increase the possibility of more retributive violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Domestic Violence: Facts and Fallacies |author=Davis, Richard L. |publisher=Praeger |year=1998 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minneapolis Experiment was based on deterrence theory, which includes the assumption that the offender is making [[rational choice theory|rational decisions]]. In the case of domestic violence (and many other offenses), offenders 
often show little rational behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fagan, Jeffrey |title=The Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits |publisher=National Institute of Justice |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Minneapolis Experiment did not measure whether being arrested increased the offenders' fear of future sanctions, a crucial element in deterrence theory.

==Replication==
Beginning in 1986, the National Institute of Justice sponsored six replications of the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment.&lt;ref name="schmidt1993"/&gt;  While each site was an independent study, NIJ required that each study had to 1) use an experimental design (i.e., random assignment), 2) address domestic violence incidents that come to the attention of the police, 3) use arrest as one of the treatments, and 4) measure repeat offending using official police records and interviews with victims. The study sites included police departments in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weisz | first = Arlene | title = Spousal assault replication program: studies of effects of arrest on domestic violence | url = http://www.vawnet.org/advanced-search/print-document.php?doc_id=394&amp;find_type=web_desc_AR | date = November 2001 |publisher = National Electronic Network on Violence Against Women }} [http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/AR_arrest.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Metro-Dade, 907 cases were used, compared to 1,200 cases in Milwaukee and over 1,600 cases in Colorado Springs.&lt;ref name="schmidt1993"/&gt;  A study initiated in Atlanta was never completed.&lt;ref name = "Garner &amp; Maxwell, 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Garner | first1 = Joel H. | last2 = Maxwell | first2 = Christopher D. | title = What are the lessons of the police arrest studies? | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–114 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J146v04n01_05 | date = September 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J146v04n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these five studies have been described as replications of the Minneapolis experiment, they each varied considerably from that study and from each other in methods and measures.&lt;ref name = "Garner, et al. 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Garner | first1 = Joel H. | last2 = Maxwell | first2 = Christopher D. | last3 = Fagan | first3 = Jeffrey | title = Published findings from the spouse assault replication program: a critical review | journal = [[Journal of Quantitative Criminology]] | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–28 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF02221298 | date = March 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02221298 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/45108/10940_2005_Article_BF02221298.pdf?sequence=1 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''Monoclonal''' cells are a group of cells produced from a single ancestral cell by repeated cellular replication.&lt;ref name="Mosby-monoclonal"/&gt;  Thus they can be said to form a single [[cloning#Cellular cloning|clone]]. The term ''monoclonal'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''monos'', meaning "alone" or "single", and ''klon'', meaning "twig".&lt;ref name="Mosby-monoclonal"&gt;{{Cite book
|chapter=Monoclonal |title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition=8th |date=2009 |publisher=Elsevier
|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/monoclonal
|access-date=June 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of replication can occur ''[[in vivo]]'', or may be stimulated ''[[in vitro]]'' for laboratory manipulations.  The use of the term typically implies that there is some method to distinguish between the cells of the original population from which the single ancestral cell is derived, such as a random genetic alteration, which is inherited by the progeny.

Common usages of this term include:
*[[Monoclonal antibody]]:  A single [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]] cell, which by chance includes the appropriate [[V(D)J recombination]] to produce the desired antibody, is cloned to produce a large population of identical cells.  In informal laboratory jargon, the monoclonal antibodies isolated from [[cell culture]] [[Precipitation (chemistry)|supernatant]]s of these hybridoma clones (hybridoma lines) are simply called ''monoclonals''.
*Monoclonal [[neoplasm]] (tumor): A single aberrant cell which has undergone [[carcinogenesis]] reproduces itself into a cancerous mass.
*Monoclonal plasma cell (also called [[plasma cell dyscrasia]]): A single aberrant plasma cell which has undergone carcinogenesis reproduces itself, which in some cases is cancerous.

'''Petrus Jacobus Kipp''' ([[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], 5 March 1808 &amp;ndash; [[Delft]], 3 February 1864) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[apothecary]], [[chemist]] and [[Scientific instrument|instrument maker]]. He became known as the inventor of the [[Kipp apparatus]], chemistry equipment for the development of gases.

==Biography==
Kipp passed his [[pharmacist]] exam in 1829 in [[Utrecht]] with a thesis on seven substances.&lt;ref name='kipp'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kippzonen.com/?page/37172/History.aspx | title = History of Kipp &amp; Zonen | publisher = Kipp &amp; Zonen | accessdate = 2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he found that, contrary to the academic medicine education with national value, his exam had mere local value, to start a pharmacy in faraway [[Delft]], he had to pass a further test at the provincial medical council. At the beginning of the 19th century, in Delft as in other cities, there was a surplus of pharmacists. Many decided to combine their work with other activities. So too Kipp started in 1830 in Delft a trade in scientific instruments and chemicals. At first his chemicals business made most profit, but after publishing a catalogue in 1850 with instruments imported from Germany and France, his sales of instruments grew in importance.

In 1840, Kipp was elected into the medical council of the city of Delft. In this responsibility, he conducted various chemical investigations assigned by the authorities, e.g., of [[drinking water]] and of [[lamp oil]] used in [[street lighting]]. Many pharmacists in those times were working on professionalisation of the profession. Kipp was one of the founders in 1842 of the Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter Bevordering der Pharmacy (Dutch Company for the advancement of Pharmacy). Also in 1842, in Delft the [[Delft University of Technology|Polytechnische Hogeschool]] was founded by [[William II of the Netherlands|King Willem II]]. The following year, Kipp's friend [[Carel Frederik Donnadieu]] was appointed Professor of Chemistry there. Between 1844 and 1850, Kipp earned extra money by translation of German [[chemistry]] books to [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]] for use at the university.

In 1842, Kipp published the results of research into the presence of [[arsenic]] in [[liver]]s and [[kidney]]s in rabbits. For this research, he used an apparatus to generate [[hydrogen]], which had been developed in 1836 by the English scientist [[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]]. Because the [[hydrogen production]] could not easily be stopped during the experiments, Kipp was dissatisfied with the design, and decided to develop his own [[gas generator]]. His first version was created by the German [[glassblower]] [[Heinrich Geißler]]; but was very fragile. The same year, Kipp make a new design, created again by Geißler. This design would be the model for all future versions of the [[Kipp's apparatus]]. In 1844, Kipp published two descriptions in the Tijdschrift voor Handel and Nijverheid (Journal for trade and industry).&lt;ref name='kipp'/&gt; The oldest known copy of the apparatus is owned by the [[Boerhaave Museum]] in [[Leiden]]. It is 62&amp;nbsp;cm high and was made between 1845 and 1875.

Kipp was married with Hanna Petronella Regina Heijligers. Together they had ten children. After his death in 1864, his activities were continued by his wife and their sons Willem and Anton under the name of 'P.J. Kipp en Zonen.' Willem ran the pharmacy, later under his own name 'W.A. Kipp,' while Anton did the trade of chemicals and instruments. At the end of the 19th century, the own production of scientific and medical instruments grew in importance more than the import of foreign products. In 2008, the three companies still are active: the Delft pharmacy W.A. Kipp, the Delft instrument maker Kipp &amp; Zonen, and the trade company Salm and Kipp.

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by Parmenides) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy R.

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A.

He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of [[entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

=====Time, causality, and process=====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic. Consequently, [[free will]] is essential and inherent to the universe.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be also be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilv8Xpxb7UAhVGOCYKHaBCB-UQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1990. "Towards a more dynamic plant morphology". ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 38: 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1992. "Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution". ''[[Canadian Journal of Botany]]'' 70: 708–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|year=|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 |url=https://www.amazon.com/too-late-theology-ecology/dp/0962680737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged out of the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]--especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction". ''Process Studies'' vol. 29, no. 1 (Spring–Summer 2000): 97–102; cf.

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===

[[Scientific research]] is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S.

(2007) Ensuring reliable datasets for environmental models and forecasts. Ecological Informatics, 2(3):237–247&lt;/ref&gt; Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of data provenance. Examples of these initiatives are [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy, as well as the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].&lt;ref name="Ma, et al."&gt;Ma, X.; Fox, P.; Tilmes, C.; Jacobs, K.; Waple, A. (2014) Capturing and presenting provenance of global change information. Nature Climate Change 4 (6), 409-413.&lt;/ref&gt; Some international academic consortia, such as the [[Research Data Alliance]], have specific group to tackle issues of provenance. In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group.&lt;ref&gt;https://rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-provenance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
Within [[computer science]], [[Information science|informatics]] uses the term 'provenance'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yu Shyang|last2=Ko|first2=Ryan K.L.|last3=Holmes|first3=Geoff|date=November 2013|title=Security and Data Accountability in Distributed Systems: A Provenance Survey|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832103/|journal=2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications &amp; 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.221|isbn=9780769550886}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the [[Data lineage|lineage of data]], as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323–326, 2008. Springer. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.7394&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, J. (2010) "[http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and the PROV Ontology&lt;ref&gt;Lebo et al. (eds.) "[https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ PROV-O: The PROV Ontology]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; make extensive use of metadata models such as [[Dublin Core]] and [[Semantic Web]] technologies such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM's successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khalidbelhajjame.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/w3c-prov-implementations/ "W3C PROV Implementations: Preliminary Analysis", Khalid Belhajjame, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

'''PyLadies''' is an international [[mentorship]] group which focuses on helping more women become active participants in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] [[open-source community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pantozzi|first=Jill|title=Presenting PyLadies: Python Programmers|url=http://www.themarysue.com/pyladies/|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutPyLadies&gt;{{cite web|title=About PyLadies|url=http://www.pyladies.com/about/|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GitHub&gt;{{cite web|title=PyLadies|url=https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies#readme|publisher=GitHub|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Python Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=n5h&amp;AN=B2IDMKE11G004069-001&amp;site=ehost-liv|title=$10,000 Raised for PyLadies at PyCon 2013|last=|first=|date=25 March 2013|work=Marketwire|access-date=21 November 2018|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started in [[Los Angeles]] in 2011. The mission of the group is to create a diverse Python community through [[outreach]], education, conferences and social gatherings. PyLadies also provides funding for women to attend open source conferences. The aim of PyLadies is increasing the participation of women in computing. PyLadies became a multi-chapter organization with the founding of the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington (D.C.)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Pyladies Meetup|url=http://www.meetup.com/dc-pyladies/|publisher=Meetup.com|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; chapter in August 2011. The group currently has more than 40 chapters around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Pyladies Locations|url=http://www.pyladies.com/locations/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
The organization was created in [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heatherpayne.ca/review-of-pyladies-intro-to-python-workshop|title=Review of PyLadies:Intro to Python|last=Payne|first=Heather|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2011 by seven women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.pyladies.com/pyladies-intro-to-python-workshop-recap/|title=PyLadies Intro to Python Workshop – PyLadies|website=blog.pyladies.com|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Audrey Roy Greenfeld, Christine Cheung, Esther Nam, Jessica Stanton, Katharine Jarmul, Sandy Strong, and Sophia Viklund. Around 2012, the organization filed for nonprofit status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/arts/geek-chicks-pyladies-a-gang-of-female-computer-programmers-2373431|title=Geek Chicks: PyLadies, a Gang of Female Computer Programmers|last=Shah|first=Angilee|date=2012-02-16|work=L.A.

==About==
PyLadies has conducted outreach events for both beginners and experienced users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nam|first=Esther|title=Events, Workshops, Hackathons and startup kits|url=http://www.women2.com/pyladies-events-workshops-hackathons-and-startup-kits/|publisher=Women 2.0|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geek Chicks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzales|first=Nanette|title=Pyladies, a gang of female computer programmers|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2012/02/pyladies_django_python.php|publisher=LaWeekly|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; PyLadies has conducted hackathons, ladies' nights and workshops for Python enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each chapter is free to run themselves as they wish as long as they are focused on the goal of empowering women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://canaltech.com.br/carreira/empoderamento-feminino-grupos-incentivam-mulheres-a-trabalhar-com-tecnologia-109500/|title=Empoderamento feminino: conheça grupos que ajudam mulheres a programar - Carreira|last=Kohn|first=Stephanie|date=2018-03-08|work=Canaltech|access-date=2018-11-22|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up the majority of the group, but membership is not limited to women and the group is open to helping people who identify as other [[Gender identity|gender identities]] as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-python-is-so-popular-with-developers-3-reasons-the-language-has-exploded/|title=Why Python is so popular with developers: 3 reasons the language has exploded|last=Rayome|first=Alison DeNisco|date=12 September 2018|work=TechRepublic|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22903">The '''recognition heuristic''', originally termed the recognition principle, has been used as a model in [[decision making|the psychology of judgment and decision making]] and as a [[heuristic]] in [[artificial intelligence]]. The goal is to make inferences about a criterion that is not directly accessible to the decision maker, based on recognition retrieved from memory. This is possible if recognition of alternatives has relevance to the criterion. For two alternatives, the heuristic is defined as:&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Daniel G.|author2=Gigerenzer, Gerd |title=Models of ecological rationality: The recognition heuristic.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 2002|volume=109|issue=1|pages=75–90|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.109.1.75|pmid=11863042}} [http://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/RecognitionPsychReview.pdf Full text (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gigerenzer|first=Gerd|title=Simple heuristics that make us smart|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195143817|edition=1st|author2=Todd, Peter M. |author3=Group, the ABC Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reasoning the fast and frugal way: Models of bounded rationality|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|issue=4|pages=650–669|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.103.4.650|pmid=8888650|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=Gerd|last2=Goldstein|first2=Daniel G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|If one of two objects is recognized and the other is not, then infer that the recognized object has the higher value with respect to the criterion.|}}

The recognition heuristic is part of the "adaptive toolbox" of "fast and frugal" heuristics proposed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein. It is one of the most frugal of these, meaning it is simple or economical.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newell|first=Ben R.|author2=Fernandez, Duane |title=On the binary quality of recognition and the inconsequentiality of further knowledge: two critical tests of the recognition heuristic|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=1 October 2006|volume=19|issue=4|pages=333–346|doi=10.1002/bdm.531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosburg 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosburg|first=T.|author2=Mecklinger, A. |author3=Frings, C. |title=When the Brain Decides: A Familiarity-Based Approach to the Recognition Heuristic as Evidenced by Event-Related Brain Potentials|journal=Psychological Science|date=3 November 2011|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1527–1534|doi=10.1177/0956797611417454|pmid=22051608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their original experiment, [[Daniel Goldstein]] and [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] quizzed students in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] on the populations of both German and American cities. Participants received pairs of city names and had to indicate which city has more inhabitants. In this and similar experiments, the recognition heuristic typically describes about 80–90% of participants' choices, in cases where they recognize one but not the other object (see criticism of this measure below). Surprisingly, American students scored higher on German cities, while German participants scored higher on American cities, despite only recognizing a fraction of the foreign cities. This has been labeled the "[[#less-is-more effect|less-is-more effect]]" and mathematically formalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katsikopoulos | first1 = K. V. | year = 2010 | title = The less-is-more effect: Predictions  and tests | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 244–257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain specificity ==

The recognition heuristic is posited as a domain-specific strategy for inference. It is ecologically rational to rely on the recognition heuristic in domains where there is a correlation between the criterion and recognition. The higher the recognition validity α for a given criterion, the more ecologically rational it is to rely on this heuristic and the more likely people will rely on it. For each individual, α can be computed by

:'''α = C/(C+W)'''
 
where C is the number of correct inferences the recognition heuristic would make, computed across all pairs in which one alternative is recognized and the other is not, and W is the number of wrong inferences. Domains in which the recognition heuristic was successfully applied include the prediction of geographical properties (such as the size of cities, mountains, etc.),&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 1999"/&gt; of sports events (such as Wimbledon and soccer championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Serwe S, Frings C|year=2006|title=Who will win Wimbledon? The recognition heuristic in predicting sports events|journal=J. Behav. Decis. Mak.|volume=19|issue=4|pages=321–32|doi=10.1002/bdm.530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Scheibehenne B, Bröder A|year=2007|title=Predicting Wimbledon 2005 tennis results by mere player name recognition|journal=Int.

N. | year = 2011 | title = Forecasting elections with mere recognition from lousy samples | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 73–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also shows that the recognition heuristic is relevant to marketing science. Recognition based heuristics help consumers choose which brands to buy in frequently purchased categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hauser | first1 = J. | year = 2011 | title = A marketing science perspective on recognition-based heuristics (and the fast-and-frugal paradigm) | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 396–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies addressed the question of whether people rely on the recognition heuristic in an ecologically rational way. For instance, name recognition of Swiss cities is a valid predictor of their population (α = 0.86) but not their distance from the center of Switzerland (α = 0.51).

If α &gt; β, and α, β are independent of n, then a less-is-more effect will be observed. Here, β is the knowledge validity, measured as C/(C+W) for all pairs in which both alternatives are recognized, and n is the number of alternatives an individual recognizes. A less-is-more effect means that the function between accuracy and n is inversely U-shaped rather than monotonically increasing. Some studies reported less-is-more effects empirically among two, three, or four alternatives&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Frosch C, Beaman CP, McCloy R|year=2007|title=A little learning is a dangerous thing: an experimental demonstration of ignorance-driven inference|journal=Q.

Smithson explored the "less-is-more effect" (LIME) with the recognition heuristic and challenges some of the original assumptions. The LIME occurs when a "recognition-dependent agent has a greater probability of choosing the better item than a more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items." A mathematical model is used in describing the LIME and Smithson’s study used it and attempted to modify it. The study was meant to mathematically provide an understanding of when the LIME occurs and explain the implications of the results. The main implication is "that the advantage of the recognition cue depends not only on the cue validities, but also on the order in which items are learned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smithson | first1 = M. | year = 2010 | title = When less is more in the recognition heuristic | url = http://journal.sjdm.org/10/rh3/rh3.pdf| journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 230–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuropsychological evidence ==
The recognition heuristic can also be depicted using neuroimaging techniques. A number of studies have shown that people do not automatically use the recognition heuristic when it can be applied, but evaluate its ecological validity. It is less clear, however, how this evaluation process can be modeled. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested whether the two processes, recognition and evaluation, can be separated on a neural basis.&lt;ref name="Volz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volz | first1 = KG | last2 = Schooler | first2 = LJ | last3 = Schubotz | first3 = RI | last4 = Raab | first4 = M | last5 = Gigerenzer | first5 = G | last6 = von Cramon | first6 = DY | year = 2006 | title = Why you think Milan is larger than Modena: neural correlates of the recognition heuristic | url = | journal = J.

Milan?"), while the second involved an inference in which participants could rely on the recognition heuristic ("Which city has the larger population: Milan or Modena?"). For mere recognition judgments, activation in the precuneus, an area that is known from independent studies to respond to recognition confidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yonelinas | first1 = AP | last2 = Otten | first2 = LJ | last3 = Shaw | first3 = KN | last4 = Rugg | first4 = MD | year = 2005 | title = Separating the brain regions involved in recollection and familiarity in recognition memory | url = | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 25 | issue = 11| pages = 3002–8 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.5295-04.2005| pmid = 15772360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was reported. In the inference task, precuneus activation was also observed, as predicted, and activation was detected in the anterior frontomedian cortex (aFMC), which has been linked in earlier studies to evaluative judgments and self-referential processing. The aFMC activation could represent the neural basis of this evaluation of ecological rationality.

Some researchers have used [[Event-related potential|event-related potentials (ERP)]] to test psychological mechanisms behind the recognition heuristic. Rosburg, Mecklinger, and Frings used a standard procedure with a city-size comparison task, similar to that used by Goldstein and Gigerenzer. They used ERP and analyzed familiarity-based recognition occurring 300-450 milliseconds after stimulus onset in order to predict the participants’ decisions. Familiarity-based recognition processes are relatively automatic and fast so these results provide evidence that simple heuristics like the recognition heuristic utilize basic cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosburg | first1 = T. | last2 = Mecklinger | first2 = A. | last3 = Frings | first3 = C. | year = 2011 | title = When the brain decides: A familiarity-based approach to the recognition heuristic as evidenced by event-related brain potentials | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1527–1534 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611417454 | pmid = 22051608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Research on the recognition heuristic has sparked a number of controversies.

=== Trade-offs ===

The recognition heuristic is a model that relies on recognition only. This leads to the testable prediction that people who rely on it will ignore strong, contradicting cues (i.e., do not make trade-offs; so-called noncompensatory inferences). In an experiment by [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]] participants were presented with pairs of cities, which included actual cities and fictional cities.  Although the recognition heuristic predicts that participants would judge the actual (recognizable) cities to be larger, participants judged the fictional (unrecognizable) cities to be larger, showing that more than recognition can play a role in such inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oppenheimer | first1 = D. M. | year = 2003 | title = Not so Fast! (and not so Frugal!): Rethinking the Recognition Heuristic | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 90 | issue = 1| pages = B1–B9 | doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00141-0| pmid = 14597272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newell &amp; Fernandez&lt;ref name="Newell 2006" /&gt; performed two experiments to try to test the claims that the recognition heuristic is distinguished from [[Availability heuristic|availability]] and [[Fluency heuristic|fluency]] through binary treatment of information and inconsequentiality of further knowledge. The results of their experiments did not support these claims. Newell &amp; Fernandez  and Richter &amp; Späth tested the non-compensatory prediction of the recognition heuristic and stated that "recognition information is not used in an all-or-none fashion but is integrated with other types of knowledge in judgment and decision making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richter | first1 = T. | last2 = Späth | first2 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Recognition is used as one cue among others in judgment and decision making | url = https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb01/fileadmin/groups/w_270518/pub_richter/Richter_Spaeth_in_press.pdf| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 150–162 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.32.1.150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reanalysis of these studies at an individual level, however, showed that typically about half of the participants consistently followed the recognition heuristic in every single trial, even in the presence of up to three contradicting cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pachur T, Bröder A, Marewski JN|year=2008|title=The recognition heuristic in memory-based inference: Is recognition a noncompensatory cue?|journal=J. Behav. Decis. Mak.|volume=21|issue=2|pages=183–210|doi=10.1002/bdm.581}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in response to those criticisms, Marewski et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Marewski JN, Gaissmaier W, Schooler LJ, Goldstein DG, Gigerenzer G|year=2010|title=From recognition to decisions: extending and testing recognition-based models for multi-alternative inference|journal=Psychon. Bull. Rev.|volume=17|issue=3|pages=287–309|doi=10.3758/PBR.17.3.287|url=http://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/Marewski_Recognition_PBR2010.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that none of the studies above formulated and tested a compensatory strategy against the recognition heuristic, leaving the strategies that participants relied on unknown. They tested five compensatory models and found that none could predict judgments better than the simple model of the recognition heuristic.

=== Measurement ===
One major criticism of studies on the recognition heuristic that was raised was that mere accordance with the recognition heuristic is not a good measure of its use. As an alternative, Hilbig et al. proposed to test the recognition heuristic more precisely devised a multinomial processing tree model for the recognition heuristic. A multinomial processing tree model is a simple statistical model often used in cognitive psychology for categorical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batchelder | first1 = W. H. | last2 = Riefer | first2 = D. M. | year = 1999 | title = Theoretical and empirical review of multinomial process tree modeling | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 57–86 | doi = 10.3758/BF03210812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilbig et al. claimed that a new model of recognition heuristic use was needed due to the confound between recognition and further knowledge. The multinomial processing tree model was shown to be effective and Hilbig et al. claimed that it provided an unbiased measure of the recognition heuristic.&lt;ref name=Hilbig /&gt;

Pachur&lt;ref name="Pachur 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pachur|first=T.|title=The limited value of precise tests of the recognition heuristic|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|volume=6|issue=5|pages=413–422|url=http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh21/rh21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that it is an imperfect model but currently it is still the best model to predict people’s recognition-based inferences. He believes that precise tests have a limited value basically because certain aspects of the recognition heuristic are often ignored and so the results could be inconsequential or misleading.

=== Intuitive strategy ===

Hilbig et al.&lt;ref name=Hilbig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbig|first=Benjamin E.|author2=Erdfelder, Edgar |author3=Pohl, Rüdiger F. |title=One-reason decision making unveiled: A measurement model of the recognition heuristic.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1 January 2010|volume=36|issue=1|pages=123–134|doi=10.1037/a0017518}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that heuristics are meant to reduce effort and that the recognition heuristic reduces effort in making judgments by relying on one single cue and ignoring other information. In their study, they found that the recognition heuristic is more useful in deliberate thought than in intuitive thought. This means it is more useful when thoughts are intentional and not impulsive as opposed to intuitive thought, which is based more on impulse rather than conscious reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbig | first1 = B. E. | last2 = Scholl | first2 = S. G. | last3 = Pohl | first3 = R. F. | year = 2010 | title = Think or blink—Is the recognition heuristic an "intuitive" strategy? | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 300–309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In contrast, a study by Pachur and Hertwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pachur T, Hertwig R|year=2006|title=On the psychology of the recognition heuristic: retrieval primacy as a key determinant of its use|journal=J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem. Cogn.|volume=32|issue= 5|pages=983–11002|url=http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/tp/TP_On_2006.pdf|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.32.5.983|pmid=16938041}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that it is actually the faster responses that are more in line with the recognition heuristic. Also, judgments accorded more strongly with the recognition heuristic under time pressure. In line with these findings, neural evidence suggests that the recognition heuristic may be relied upon by default.&lt;ref name="Volz" /&gt;

== Support ==

Goldstein and Gigerenzer&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gigerenzer|first=G.|author2=Goldstein, D. G. |title=The beauty of simple models: Themes in recognition heuristic research|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2011|volume=6|issue=5|pages=392–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that due to its simplicity, the recognition heuristic shows to what degree and in what situations behavior can be predicted.  Some researchers suggest that the idea of the recognition heuristic should be retired but Pachur believes that a different approach should be taken in testing it. There are some researchers who believe that the recognition heuristic should be investigated using precise tests of the exclusive use of recognition.

Another study by Pachur&lt;ref name="Pachur 2008"/&gt; suggested that the recognition heuristic is more likely a tool for exploring natural rather than induced recognition (i.e. not provoked in a laboratory setting) when inferences have to be made from memory. In one of his experiments, the results showed that there was a difference between participants in an experimental setting vs. a non-experimental setting.

== Synopsis ==

Using an [[adversarial collaboration]] approach, three special issues of the [[open access]] journal ''Judgment and Decision Making'' have been devoted to unravel the support for and problems with the recognition heuristic, providing the most recent and comprehensive synopsis of the epistemic status quo. In their Editorial to Issue III, the three guest editors strive for a cumulative theory integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marewski | first1 = J. N. | last2 = Pohl | first2 = R.

'''Science Olympiad''' is an [[United States|American]] team competition in which students compete in 23 events pertaining to various [[scientific]] disciplines, including earth science, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Over 7,800 middle school and high school teams from 50 U.S. states compete each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-11%20at%2012.24.14%20PM.png 2017 Science Olympiad Membership Map]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Olympiad History"&gt;[http://soinc.org/history Science Olympiad History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soinc.org/join/state-websites|title=State Websites {{!}} Science Olympiad|website=www.soinc.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. territories do not compete; however, since 2012 high school teams from Japan have competed at the national tournament as unranked guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Japanese_International_Team|title=Japanese International Team - Science Olympiad Student Center Wiki|website=scioly.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple levels of competition: invitational, regional, state, and national. Invitational tournaments, run by high schools and universities, are unofficial tournaments and serve as practice for regional and state competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soinc.org/invitationals/ Science Olympiad Invitational Tournaments]&lt;/ref&gt; Teams that excel at regional competitions advance to the state level; the top one or two teams from each state (depending on the state) then advance the national level. Winners later receive several kinds of awards, including medals, trophies and plaques, as well as scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wright.edu/event/science-olympiad-2017/scholarships|title=Scholarships {{!}} Science Olympiad 2017 {{!}} Wright State University|website=www.wright.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program for elementary-age students is less common and consistent.  Schools have flexibility to implement the program to meet their needs.  Some communities host competitive elementary tournaments.

Science Olympiad is not associated with the [[International Science Olympiad]]s, which follow a completely different format and set of rules.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==History==

The first recorded Science Olympiad was held on Saturday, November 23, 1974 at [[St. Andrews Presbyterian College]] in [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]], [[North Carolina]]. Dr.  Barnes and Dr. David Wetmore were the originators of this event. Fifteen schools from North and South Carolina participated in this event.  It was a day-long affair, with competitions and demonstrations for high school students in the areas of biology, chemistry, and physics. There were four event periods during this day and each event period had one fun event (like beaker race or paper airplane), one demonstration (like glassblowing and holography), and one serious event (like periodic table quiz or Science Bowl). An article by David Wetmore was published in the [[Journal of Chemical Education]] in January 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed055p43 | volume=55 | title=Student recruitment through a science olympiad | year=1978 | journal=Journal of Chemical Education | page=43 | last1 = Wetmore | first1 = David E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; documenting the success of recruiting students through Science Olympiad. St. Andrews Presbyterian College continues to host a Science Olympiad tournament to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenc.com/tournament-information/laurinburg/laurinburg.php Science Olympiad Tournament at St. Andrew's Presbyterian College]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. John C. "Jack" Cairns was a teacher at [[Dover High School (Delaware)|Dover High School]] in Delaware when he learned about the [[North Carolina Science Olympiad|Science Olympiad tournament in North Carolina]]. He shared this information with Dr. Douglas R. Macbeth, the Delaware State Science Supervisor. Mr. Cairns was appointed to a steering committee to organize the first Science Olympiad in Delaware&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympiad.k12.de.us/ Delaware Science Olympiad]&lt;/ref&gt; which took place at [[Delaware State University]] in the Spring of 1977.  A write-up in ''[[The Science Teacher]]'' of December 1977 caught the attention of [[Dr. Gerard Putz]], who proposed that the program be expanded throughout the United States. After competition tests in [[Michigan]] at the [[Lawrence Institute of Technology]] and [[Oakland University]] in 1983 and 1984, Putz and Delaware director John Cairns took their plan for a national competition to the [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teachers Conference]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The first National Tournament was attended by representatives of 17 states, held at [[Michigan State University]] in 1985. Since then, the program has expanded greatly, with 60 teams present in each division at the National Tournament.&lt;ref name="Science Olympiad History"/&gt;  In 2012, a Global Ambassador Team from Japan was invited to attend the national tournament at the University of Central Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[[Science Olympiad National Tournament 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan continues to send a team, as of the 2017 National Tournament.

==Divisions==
There are three divisions in the hierarchy of Science Olympiad:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/divisions_abc&lt;/ref&gt;

* Division A for elementary school (grades K-6)
* Division B for middle school (grades 6-9)
* Division C for high school (grades 9-12)

However, the national tournament and generally state and regional tournaments are only for divisions B and C. Division A teams usually have separate interscholastic tournaments, apart from the more common intra-school competitions. Note that 6th and 9th graders have the option of competing in either of the two divisions in which they meet the grade requirements and are part of the competing school. A middle school may, however, only use up to 5 members who have graduated to the next school if they are in 9th grade or lower. Students in grades lower than the division in which the school competes in may also be on the team. Teams are restricted to five 9th graders for division B and seven 12th graders for division C. Students may not participate on multiple teams, e.g. a 9th grader on both a high school and middle school team would not be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soinc.org/divisions_abc Divisions Science Olympiad Divisions]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and Event History==
In Divisions B and C, teams may compete in up to twenty-three main events, which usually occur over a single day (some tournaments, such as the Texas State tournament, run competitive events over multiple days); done by a team of no more than 15 members.  Events fall into five main categories: Life, Personal, and Social Science, Earth &amp; Space Science, Physical Science &amp; Chemistry, Technology &amp; Engineering, Inquiry &amp; Nature of Science.  They are either knowledge-based (for example, written tests on [[earth science]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], or [[biology]]), hands-on (for example, [[chemistry]] lab practicals or events involving both device testing and an exam), or engineering-based (participants construct a device to do specified tasks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://soinc.org/short_event_descriptions Event Descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge-based events generally have two participants taking a test and/or mathematically analyzing data. Examples of such events are Anatomy and Physiology, Meteorology, and Remote Sensing.

Hands-on events generally consist of two participants performing experiments or interacting with physical objects to achieve a certain goal. Some examples are Forensics, Experimental Design, and Hovercraft.

Engineering-based events have a team of two to three participants. They are to construct a device following a specific event's parameters and test the device against others. Examples include Battery Buggy, Towers, and Mission Possible.

The majority of events allow two team members, though a few allow more.  If one member is unable to attend an event, the other is able to continue, depending on the event, with the [[competition]], though at an obvious disadvantage. If the team has one available, a backup team member may be placed with the member as opposed to their former partner.

The list and rules for events change and are updated every year to input dynamism and to limit the advantages of more experienced teams.

States have substantial leeway in how they run their organization; several states, notably [[North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencenc.com/events.php#b North Carolina-specific events Division B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencenc.com/events.php#c North Carolina-specific events Division C&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Texas]], run altered slates of events; in the case of Texas, teams can choose to replace National events with state-exclusive events.

==Trial/Pilot Events==
Trial/Pilot events are, at Regional and State tournaments, events that are specific to that state that are being considered as events for the next year. At Regionals and States, these events may count towards the team's score. At Nationals, however, there is a completely different set of Trial/Pilot events, sometimes known as "alternate events" because the people entering them do not have to be on the official team. These do not count towards the team's score, but ribbons and medals are usually awarded.

===Distinction Between Trial and Pilot Events===
The terms "trial event" and "pilot event" (also called "exploratory event") are sometimes interchangeable, both pertaining to an event that is not an official, national event for the year. However, at the National Tournament, there are often two differences. First, in 2010, it was announced that medals would only be awarded to the top 3 in the Trial events, but not at all in the Pilot events.  Also, the Trial event are often much closer to becoming official events for following years than pilot events. Almost all of the Trial events from recent National tournaments have become official events within a few years of the tournament, while the same is not true for almost any of the pilot events.

==Team Structure==
Teams are hosted by the [[school]] from which the participants attend. Science Olympiad is most often run as an after-school [[extracurricular activity]], but some schools offer Science Olympiad classes that allow students to receive academic credit for participation.  A [[teacher]], [[parent]], or [[student]] (usually a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]) coordinates the team in practice and preparation for the [[competition]].  Often there are others who coach individual events as well.  A team can consist of up to 15 [[students]] and any number of alternates; some states allow more students per team.  At the [[middle school]] level at nationals, only five ninth graders are allowed to compete on one team; at the [[high school]] level, only seven twelfth graders are allowed per team. However, state organizations occasionally amend these rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencenc.com/policy-information/team_size.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homeschooling|Homeschool]] groups may also form [[team]]s to compete.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/home_virtual_schools&lt;/ref&gt;

Although teams may have an unlimited number of alternates, it is implicitly stated within the rules that competitors present at the event must have completed all of the work on their event. This is specifically aimed at building events. It is illegal for teams to have their alternates as "builders" and their formal team members as "thinkers". Judges at the event are allowed to ask any question of the machine or contraption in an effort to keep the scenario above from occurring. Nonetheless, competitors, coaches, and entire teams are expected to have integrity and to abide by this rule.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/building_tools_policy&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of strategy usually goes into forming a [[team]]. Since events go on at the same time as other events during a competition and conflicts may occur, the coach or coordinator must make decisions based on the competitor's specialty and ability in order to correctly place him/her. Sometimes, usually during the reformation of competitors when a team advances a level, a competitor who wasn't originally planned to compete in a certain event may have to compete in it to fill the certain event slot.

==Scoring==

The [[Wikt:winner|winner]] of the competition is determined by each team's overall [[Score (gaming)|score]].  Each [[school]] is ranked in every event based on that event's rules. For each type of event, the ranking differs. Knowledge events are scored by the correct number of answers; the team with the highest score will receive 1st place, the second highest will receive 2nd place, and so on. If two teams are tied, there are usually tiebreaker questions that apply only to those teams that are tied. The non-testing events are scored based off the individual requirements listed in the Science Olympiad rule book, released each year to reflect new events, requirements, and clarifications. Some events, such as the knowledge/testing-based will rank teams by using the highest scores. However others may use the lowest score. The team's overall score is then calculated by adding together the rank of the school in all events (e.g. 1st place receives 1 point, 2nd place 2 points, etc.). The [[team]] with the lowest overall score is declared the winner. However, it should be noted that some state competitions choose to score the competition by awarding more points per place (e.g. 13 points for 1st place, 12 points for 2nd place, etc.) and having the team with the most points being declared the winner.

There are several ways to break a [[tie (draw)]]:

* One method for tie-breaking is based on [[medals]] where the team with more first place medals wins. If both teams have the same amount of first places, it moves to second place medals and so on. This is the method that the National Tournament uses.
* Before a competition, the event organizer decides on several events to be used as [[Tiebreaker|tie-breakers]].  If two teams get the same score overall, the team that rates highest in that one event will take the lead.
* A third way of tie-breaking is to use a team's score in trial/pilot events. The team with the best combined score in trial events would win the competition when this method is used.
* In some competitions, there also may questions added into event, labeled as tie-breakers. If needed, these questions can be used as tie breakers, although this type of tie-breaker is generally for only the event and not the overall rank.

==Competition Levels==

Science Olympiad competitions occur at the [[regional]], [[U.S. state|state]] and [[nation]]al level.  Normally, the top few teams advance from the regional level to state competition, the exact number depending on how many regions there are and how many teams compete.  For example, in Ohio, the number of teams qualifying for the state tournament from each regional depends solely on the number of teams participating at that regional,&lt;ref&gt;https://ohso.osu.edu/regional-tournaments&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in New York the allocation system involved determining whether or not the winning team in a regional tournament had won the previous year (this method has since been discontinued). In most states, the top team advances from the state to the national competition.  Some states with a larger number of teams are allotted a second spot at the national competition to represent their larger participation.  Currently, 120 teams compete at the national level each year (60 from Division B and 60 from Division C); the number has changed over the years to accommodate growing participation.

Many states also hold invitational tournaments. These competitions serve as "practice rounds" for qualifying tournaments, and are hosted by individual middle schools, high schools and/or colleges.&lt;ref&gt;https://ohso.osu.edu/invitational-tournaments&lt;/ref&gt; Invitationals occur most commonly in January or February,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/invitationals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scioly.org/wiki/Invitational&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/state_websites&lt;/ref&gt; although there have been some as early as October&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/rmsstscio/home&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/a/cfisd.net/cypress-falls-science-olympiad-invitational/&lt;/ref&gt; or as late as April.&lt;ref name="atxscioly.com"&gt;http://atxscioly.com/competition.html&lt;/ref&gt; Teams can participate in invitationals from multiple states depending on availability.  At some invitationals, only a few events are held. However, many invitational tournaments mimic regional and state competitions in their competitive intensity. For example, MIT hosts an invitational tournament each year with around 70 teams from over a dozen states, including 20 or more past national qualifiers.&lt;ref name="scioly.mit.edu"&gt;http://scioly.mit.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=218&amp;t=7617#p283276&lt;/ref&gt; Other tournaments, especially in the midwest, are well known for their quality and competitiveness. In this way, teams can gain extra practice before competing in regional, state, or national tournaments. In 2014, [[Yale University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://yuso.yale.edu&lt;/ref&gt; became one of the first institutions of higher education to host a tournament run by Science Olympiad alumni, with several more following over the next few years.&lt;ref name="scioly.mit.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://goldengateso.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornellscioly.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atxscioly.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ricesoaa.weebly.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pennscienceolympiad.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeton.edu/~scioly/&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Tournament==

The National Science Olympiad competition is held in late May at a different university every year. Teams compete at the state competition with the top two schools in Division B and Division C each earning a spot at the national competition. Some states are given a second slot, based on the membership within the division.  The total number of invited teams in each division is equal to 60 and the national tournament hosts 120 teams. In 2012, at the [[University of Central Florida]], a team from Japan was invited as a Global Ambassador Team. Although they competed in several events, their scores were not tallied against the state teams.

The competition officially begins with opening ceremonies on Friday night that usually include a notable speaker, such as a [[Nobel Laureate]]. A traditional Swap Meet follows the opening ceremonies which is an opportunity for teams to meet and greet. They bring state memorabilia to trade with other teams. The most popular items include hats, license plates, T-shirts, and key chains.

Saturday includes several time blocks. Each block includes a 60-minute section for each study event, plus a 15-minute break time for competitors to get from one event to another.

That night, a formal Awards Ceremony is held. It opens with a short speech followed by awarding medals for the top six teams in each event.  Points for all the events are added together to determine an overall national team winner.  The trial events are not included in this tally. The top ten teams in each division are recognized with trophies and plaques.

In some national tournaments, scholarships are awarded to the top teams in each event. For the 2005 and 2010 competitions, held at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], first-place event winners received full four-year tuition waivers to the university. At the 2006 National Tournament, host [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] awarded $7,000 annual scholarships to those who finished first place in Division C and who attend the university in their freshman year. [[The George Washington University]] offered Division C gold medalists at its 2008 National Tournament a $20,000 stipend for those who were accepted and attended GWU.  In 2012, the [[University of Central Florida]] offered $30,000 scholarships to the university for first place medalists in Division C.  Additional awards may also provided by sponsors and industry leaders for specific events.  For example, the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] provided first place medalists in Disease Detectives (Divisions B &amp; C) with a trip for the two competitors and their coach to tour the [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] facility in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

Six universities have hosted the National Tournament twice: [[Michigan State University]], [[Ohio State University]], [[University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign]], [[Indiana University-Bloomington]], [[University of Central Florida]], and [[Wright State University]].

==Division A==
Division A generally covers elementary school students (through 6th grade). Schools which wish to start a Science Olympiad program at their school can take advantage of the resources offered on the National Science Olympiad website.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/elementary&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no National membership fee required to participate in Elementary Division activities.&lt;ref name="soinc.org"&gt;https://www.soinc.org/competitive_tournaments&lt;/ref&gt;  An appropriate program will depend upon the objectives and resources of the local school or community.  Programs can range from a Fun Night&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/fun_day_night&lt;/ref&gt; to a large competitive tournament.&lt;ref name="soinc.org"/&gt;  Some Elementary programs have existed as long as the National program, and have developed additional resources that schools may find helpful.&lt;ref&gt;http://macombso.org/index.php/esoresources&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17527">'''Simulation theory of empathy''' is a theory that holds that humans anticipate and make sense of the behavior of others by activating mental processes that, if carried into action, would produce similar behavior. This includes intentional behavior as well as the expression of emotions. The theory states that children use their own emotions to predict what others will do. Therefore, we project our own mental states onto others.&lt;br /&gt;
Simulation theory is not primarily a theory ''of'' [[empathy]], but rather a theory of how people understand others—that they do so ''by way of'' a kind of empathetic response. This theory uses more biological evidence than other theories of mind, such as the [[theory-theory]].

== Origin ==
Simulation theory is based in [[philosophy of mind]], a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and its relationship to the brain,  especially the work of Alvin Goldman and Robert Gordon. The discovery of [[mirror neurons]] in macaque monkeys has provided a physiological mechanism for the common coding between perception and action (see [[Wolfgang Prinz]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=di Pellegrino, G.|author2=Fadiga, L.|author3=Fogassi, L.|author4=Gallese, V.|author5=Rizzolatti, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Understanding motor events - A neurophysiological study|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=91|issue=1|pp=176–180|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/dipellegrino_etal_understmotorevents_ebr1992.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF00230027|pmid=1301372}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hypothesis of a similar mirror neuron system in the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Preston, S.D.|author2=de Wall, F.B.M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Empathy: its ultimate and proximate bases|journal= Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=25|issue=1|pp=1–72|pmid=12625087|url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Preston_dewaal2002.pdf|doi=10.1017/S0140525X02000018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Iacoboni, M.|author2=Woods, R. P.|author3=Brass, M.|author4link=Harold Bekkering|author4=Bekkering, H.|author5=Mazziotta, J. C.|author6=Rizzolatti, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1999|title=Cortical mechanisms of human imitation|journal=Science|volume=286|issue=5449|pp=2526–2528|pmid=10617472|doi=10.1126/science.286.5449.2526|citeseerx=10.1.1.555.8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the discovery of the mirror neuron system, many studies have been carried out to examine the role of this system in action understanding, emotion and other social functions.

== Development ==
Mirror neurons are activated both when actions are executed and the actions are observed. This unique function of mirror neurons may explain how people recognize and understand the states of others; mirroring observed action in the brain as if they conducted the observed action.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gallese, V.|author2=Keysers, C.|author3=Rizzolatti, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=A unifying view of the basis of social cognition|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=8|issue=9|pp=396–403|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.07.002|pmid=15350240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two sets of evidence suggest that mirror neurons in the monkey have a role in action understanding.  First, the activation of mirror neurons requires biological effectors such as hand or mouth. Mirror neurons do not respond to the action with tools like pliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gallese, V.|author2=Fadiga, L.|author3=Fogassi, L.|author4=Rizzolatti, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Action recognition in the premotor cortex|journal= Brain|volume=119|issue=Pt 2|pp=593–609|doi=10.1093/brain/119.2.593|pmid=8800951|url=https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/brain/119/2/10.1093/brain/119.2.593/2/119-2-593.pdf?Expires=1503967362&amp;Signature=Os76kN4jb5~VnamS8nnnGygb1NgkSFeJOnUd31~p4yGzlf1Wq1Rcy2qY5PG7Ge6cY8c~y6rACSooAufP7LVv3jJ6wbQtPs~EeAsD4ipU1X3BaZPivdKn71LmaJzH-16an64ebBEND3aeKOgbWfoflI~O4nmNbwhm-LJlbspzmiJqb4GdnxxPYJ00cDkoyLiXpElbqPvkbX7-v8mJQG6Jeyh9BWjvofIJo1sRmBgJ6FEJ0fINEXVAzhuxod8ggtUbJNNS9x29N1Yc2sGigsLL-kCY~i~9AOFH8mR6kayfNA27GEKkp1dm2lxxfJSNTbuyxSGkbXBJZs6D9AyBIhsRxg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror neurons respond to neither the sight of an object alone nor an action without an object (intransitive action). Umilta and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Umilta, M. A.|author2=Kohler, E.|author3=Gallese, V.|author4=Fogassi, L.|author5=Fadiga, L.|author6=Keysers, C.|displayauthors=etal|year=2001|title=I know what you are doing: A neurophysiological study|journal=Neuron|volume=31|issue=1|pp=155–165|pmid=11498058|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301003373|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00337-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that a subset of mirror neurons fired when final critical part of the action was not visible to the observer. The experimenter showed his hand moving toward a cube and grasping it, and later showed the same action without showing later part grasping the cube (placing the cube behind the occluder). Mirror neurons fired on both visible and invisible conditions. On the other hand, mirror neurons did not discharge when the observer knew that there was not a cube behind the occluder.

Second, responses of mirror neurons to same actions are different depending on context of the action. A single cell recording experiment with monkeys demonstrated the different level of activation of mouth mirror neurons when monkey observed mouth movement depending on context (ingestive actions such as sucking juice vs. communicative actions such as lip-smacking or tongue protrusions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ferrari, P. F.|author2=Gallese, V.|author3=Rizzolatti, G.|author4=Fogassi, L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Mirror neurons responding to the observation of ingestive and communicative mouth actions in the monkey ventral premotor cortex|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=17|issue=8|pp=1703–1714|pmid=12752388|doi=10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02601.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.177.2287|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.2287&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[fMRI]] study also showed that mirror neurons respond to the action of grasping a cup differently depending on context (to drink a cup of coffee vs. to clean a table on which a cup was placed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Iacoboni, M.|author2=Molnar-Szakacs, I.|author3=Gallese, V.|author4=Buccino, G.|author5=Mazziotta, J. C.|author6=Rizzolatti, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Grasping the intentions of others with one's own mirror neuron system|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=3|issue=3|pp=529–535|pmid=15736981|pmc=1044835|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism of mirror neurons is that since they show that same muscle groups is used for someone watching an action as someone completing an action, they only predict actions, not beliefs or desires.  While someone acts a certain way, they may not believe that what they are doing is the right thing.

=== Emotion understanding ===
Shared neural representation for a motor behavior and its observation has been extended into the domains of feelings and emotions.  Not only movements but also facial expressions activate the same brain regions that are activated by direct experiences.  In an fMRI study, same brain regions on action representation found to be activated when people both imitated and observed emotional facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, disgust, and afraid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carr, L.|author2=Iacoboni, M.|author3=Dubeau, M. C.|author4=Mazziotta, J. C.|author5=Lenzi, G. L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Neural mechanisms of empathy in humans: A relay from neural systems for imitation to limbic areas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100|issue=9|pp=5497–5502|pmid=12682281|pmc=154373|doi=10.1073/pnas.0935845100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observing video clips that displayed facial expression of feeling disgust activated the neural networks typical of direct experience of disgust.&lt;ref name="Wicker2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wicker, B.|author2=Keysers, C.|author3=Plailly, J.|author4=Royet, J. P.|author5=Gallese, V.|author6=Rizzolatti, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Both of us disgusted in my insula: The common neural basis of seeing and feeling disgust|journal=Neuron|volume=40|issue=3|pp=655–664|pmid=14642287|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00679-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627303006792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results have been found in the case of touch. Watching movies that someone touched legs or faces activated the [[somatosensory cortex]] for direct feeling of the touch.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keysers, C.|author2=Wicker, B.|author3=Gazzola, V.|author4=Anton, J. L.|author5=Fogassi, L.|author6= Gallese, V.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=A touching sight: SII/PV activation during the observation and experience of touch|journal=Neuron|volume=42|issue=2|pp=335–346|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627304001564|pmid=15091347|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00156-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mirror system exists in perceiving pain. When people see other people feel pain, people feel pain not only affectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Avenanti, A.|author2=Paluello, L. M.|author3=Bufalari, I.|author4=Aglioti, S. M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=Stimulus-driven modulation of motor-evoked potentials during observation of others' pain|journal=NeuroImage|volume=32|issue=1|pp=316–324|pmid=16675270|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also sensorially.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Singer, T.|author2=Seymour, B.|author3=O'Doherty, J.|author4=Kaube, H.|author5=Dolan, R. J.|author6=Frith, C. D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Empathy for pain involves the affective but not sensory components of pain|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5661|pp=1157–1162|pmid=14976305|doi=10.1126/science.1093535|jstor=3836287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These results suggest that understanding other's feelings and emotions is driven not by cognitive deduction of what the stimuli means but by automatic activation of somatosensory neurons. A recent study on pupil size directly demonstrated emotion perception was automatic process modulated by mirror systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harrison, N. A.|author2=Singer, T.|author3=Rotshtein, P.|author4=Dolan, R. J.|author5=Critchley, H. D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=Pupillary contagion: Central mechanisms engaged in sadness processing|journal=SCAN|volume=1|issue=1|pp=5–17|pmid=17186063|doi=10.1093/scan/nsl006|pmc=1716019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people saw sad faces, pupil sizes influenced viewers in perceiving and judging emotional states without explicit awareness of differences of pupil size. When pupil size was 180% of original size, people perceived a sad face as less negative and less intense than when pupil was smaller than or equal to original pupil size. This mechanism was correlated with brain regions that implicated in emotion process, the [[amygdala]]. Furthermore, viewers mimic the size of their own pupils to those of sad faces they watched. Considering that pupil size is beyond voluntary control, the change of pupil size upon emotion judgment is a good indication that understanding emotions is automatic process. However, the study could not find other emotional faces such as happiness and anger influence pupil size as sadness did.

=== Epistemological role of empathy ===
Understanding other's actions and emotions is believed to facilitate efficient human communication.  Based on findings from neuroimaging studies, de Vignemont and Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=de Vignemont, F.|author2=Singer, T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=The empathic brain: How, when and why?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=10|issue=10|pp=435–441|pmid=16949331|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed empathy as a crucial factor in human communication arguing its epistemological role; "Empathy might enable us to make faster and more accurate predictions of other people's needs and actions and discover salient aspects of our environment."  Mental mirroring of actions and emotions may enable humans to understand other's actions and their related environment quickly, and thus help humans communicate efficiently.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In an fMRI study, a mirror system has been proposed as common neural substrates to mediate the experiences of basic emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chakrabarti, B.|author2=Bullmore, E.|author3=Baron-Cohen, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=Empathizing with basic emotions: Common and discrete neural substrates|journal=Social Neuroscience|volume=1|issue=3&amp;4|pp=364–384|pmid=18633800|doi=10.1080/17470910601041317}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants watched video clips of happy, sad, angry and disgust facial expressions, and measured their [[empathy quotient]] (EQ). Specific brain regions relevant to the four emotions were found to be correlated with the EQ while the mirror system (i.e., the left dorsal inferior [[frontal gyrus]]/[[premotor cortex]]) was correlated to the EQ across all emotions.  The authors interpreted this result as an evidence that action perception mediates face perception to emotion perception.

==Empathy for pain==
A paper published in Science (Singer et al., 2005)&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; challenges the idea that pain sensations and mirror neurons play a role in empathy for pain. Specifically, the authors found that activity in the anterior insula and the anterior [[cingulate cortex]] was present both when one's self and another person were presented with a painful stimulus, two regions known to be responsible for the affective experience of pain, but the rest of the pain matrix, responsible for sensation, was not active. Furthermore, participants merely saw the hand of another person with the electrode on it, making it unlikely that 'mirroring' could have caused the empathic response. However, a number of other studies, using [[magnetoencephalography]] and functional MRI have since demonstrated that empathy for pain does involve the [[somatosensory cortex]], which supports the simulation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cheng, Y.|author2=Yang, C.Y.|author3=Lin, C.P.|author4=Lee, P.R.|author5= Decety, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2008|title=The perception of pain in others suppresses somatosensory oscillations: a magnetoencephalography study|journal=NeuroImage|volume=40|issue=4|pp=1833–1840|pmid=18353686|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moriguchi, Y.|author2=Decety, J.|author3=Ohnishi, T.|author4=Maeda, M.|author5=Matsuda, H.|author6=Komaki, G. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Empathy and judging other's pain: An fMRI study of alexithymia|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=17|issue=9|pp=2223–2234|pmid=17150987|doi= 10.1093/cercor/bhl130|url=https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhl130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lamm, C.|author2=Nusbaum, H.C.|author3=Meltzoff, A.N.|author4=Decety, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=What are you feeling?

Support for anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex being the neural substrates of empathy include Wicker et al., 2003 who report that their "core finding is that the anterior insula is activated both during observation of disgusted facial expressions and during the emotion of disgust evoked by unpleasant odorants"&lt;ref name="Wicker2003"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;655).

Furthermore, one study demonstrated that "for actions, emotions, and sensations both animate and inanimate touch activates our inner representation of touch." They note, however that "it is important at this point to clarify the fact that we do not believe that the activation we observe evolved in order to empathize with other objects or human beings"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  (p.&amp;nbsp;343).

==Empathy activating altruism==

This model states that empathy activates only one interpersonal motivation: altruism. Theoretically, this model makes sense, because empathy is an other-focused emotion.  There is an impressive history of research suggesting that empathy, when activated, causes people to act in ways to benefit the other, such as receiving electric shocks for the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C. D|title=The Altruism Question: Toward a Social-Psychological Answer|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first=C. D.|author2=Gilbert, D. T. |author3=Fiske, S. T. |author4=Lindzey, G. |title=The handbook of social psychology|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have often been interpreted in terms of empathy causing increased altruistic motivation, which in turn causes helping behavior.

'''Spontaneous generation''' refers to an obsolete body of thought on the ordinary formation of living organisms without descent from similar organisms. The theory of spontaneous generation held that living creatures could arise from nonliving matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular. For instance, it was hypothesized that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust, or that [[maggot]]s could arise from dead flesh.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Man Made: A History of Synthetic Life|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/man-made-a-history-of-synthetic-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant idea was that of '''equivocal generation''', in which species such as [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] arose from unrelated living organisms, now understood to be their [[Host (biology)|hosts]]. The idea of '''univocal generation''', by contrast, refers to effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related parent(s), generally of the same [[species]].

The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brack, André |editor=Brack, André |title=The Molecular Origins of Life |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-56475-5 |page=1 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/64755/excerpt/9780521564755_excerpt.pdf | quote=Aristotle gathered the different claims into a real theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled and expanded the work of [[Pre-Socratic_philosophy|earlier natural philosophers]] and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms, and was taken as scientific fact for two millennia. Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of [[Francesco Redi]] and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], spontaneous generation was not disproved until the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[John Tyndall]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"&gt;Tyndall, John; Fragments of Science, Vol 2, chapters IV, XII (1876), XIII(1878); Pub.

After sterilizing a nutrient broth in these flasks, he removed the swan necks of the controls. Microorganisms grew only in the controls, refuting spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt;]]

Rejection of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists.

Spontaneous generation refers both to the supposed processes by which different types of life might repeatedly emerge from specific sources other than seeds, eggs, or parents, and also to theoretical principles presented in support of any such phenomena. Crucial to this doctrine are the ideas that life comes from non-life and that no causal agent, such as a parent, is needed. The hypothetical processes by which life routinely emerges from nonliving matter on a time scale of minutes, weeks, or years (e.g. in the supposed seasonal generation of mice and other animals from the mud of the [[Nile]]) are sometimes referred to as ''abiogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;Stillingfleet, Edward. ''Origines Sacrae''. Cambridge University Press 1697. May be downloaded from [https://archive.org/details/originessacraeor00stil]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas have no operative principles in common with the modern hypothesis of [[abiogenesis]], which asserts that life emerged in the early ages of the planet, over a time span of at least millions of years, and subsequently diversified, and that there is no evidence of any subsequent repetition of the event.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernal |first=J.

The term ''equivocal generation'', sometimes known as ''heterogenesis'' or ''xenogenesis'', describes the supposed process by which one form of life arises from a different, unrelated form, such as tapeworms from the bodies of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Wiener, Philip P. | title=Dictionary of the History of Ideas | accessdate=2009-01-22 | year=1973 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | chapter=Spontaneous Generation | chapterurl=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;chunk.id=dv4-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment, the term "spontaneous generation" fell increasingly out of favor. Experimentalists used a variety of terms for the study of the origin of life from nonliving materials. ''Heterogenesis'' was applied to the generation of living things from once-living organic matter (such as boiled broths), and [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] proposed the term ''archebiosis'' for life originating from inorganic materials. Disliking the randomness and unpredictability implied by the term "'spontaneous' generation," in 1870 Bastian coined the term ''biogenesis'' to refer to the formation of life from nonliving matter. Soon thereafter, however, English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] proposed the term ''[[abiogenesis]]'' to refer to this same process and adopted ''[[biogenesis]]'' for the process by which life arises from existing life; it is this latter set of definitions that became dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strick |first=James |title=Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |date=April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
===Presocratic philosophers===
Active in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, early Greek philosophers, called ''physiologoi'' in antiquity (Greek: φυσιολόγοι; in English, physical or [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]]), attempted to give natural explanations of [[phenomena]] that had previously been ascribed to the agency of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie|Guthrie, William Keith Chambers]], ''The Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'', p. 13, {{ISBN|0-317-66577-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''physiologoi'' sought the material principle or ''[[arche]]'' (Greek: ἀρχή) of things, emphasizing the rational unity of the external world and rejecting theological or mythological explanations.&lt;ref name="seyffert480"&gt;Seyffert, Oskar (1894), ''Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', page 480&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Anaximander]], who believed that all things arose from the elemental nature of the universe, the ''[[Apeiron_(cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (ἄπειρον) or the "unbounded" or "infinite," was likely the first western thinker to propose that life developed spontaneously from nonliving matter. The [[substance theory|primal chaos]] of the ''apeiron,'' eternally in motion, served as a substratum in which elemental opposites (e.g., wet and dry, hot and cold) generated and shaped the many and varied things in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author=Curd, Patricia |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press| page=77 |isbn=0-691-01182-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in the third century CE, Anaximander claimed that fish or fish-like creatures were first formed in the "wet" when acted on by the heat of the sun and that these aquatic creatures gave rise to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Charles H. |title=Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology |date=1994 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=0872202550 |pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century, reports:

{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], a pupil of Anaximander, thought that air was the element that imparted life and endowed creatures with motion and thought. He proposed that plants and animals, including human beings, arose from a primordial terrestrial slime, a mixture of earth and water, combined with the sun's heat. [[Anaxagoras]], too, believed that life emerged from a terrestrial slime. However, he held that the seeds of plants existed in the air from the beginning, and those of animals in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. [[Xenophanes]] traced the origin of man back to the transitional period between the fluid stage of the earth and the formation of land, under the influence of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborn |first=Henry Fairfield |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |title=From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea|date=1894 |publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what has occasionally been seen as a prefiguration of a concept of [[natural selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |title=Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species" |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |date=1941 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] accepted the spontaneous generation of life but held that different forms, made up of differing combinations of parts, spontaneously arose as though by trial and error: successful combinations formed the species we now see, whereas unsuccessful forms failed to reproduce.

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|[[Aristotle]] proposed that in sexual reproduction, the child inherits [[Hylomorphism|form]] (eidos) from the father and matter from the mother, as well as heat (pneuma) either from the father or from the environment.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spontaneous generation, the environment could effectively replace the parents' contributions of form, matter, and heat.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22/&gt;]]

In his biological works, the natural philosopher Aristotle theorized extensively the reproduction of various animals, whether by [[sexual reproduction|sexual]], [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], or spontaneous generation. In accordance with his fundamental theory of [[hylomorphism]], which held that every physical entity was a compound of matter and form, Aristotle's basic theory of sexual reproduction contended that the [[semen|male's seed]] imposed form, the set of characteristics passed down to offspring on the "matter" (menstrual blood) supplied by the female. Thus female matter is the [[Four_causes#Matter|material cause]] of generation—it supplies the matter that will constitute the offspring—while the male semen is the [[Four_causes#Agent|efficient cause]], the factor that instigates and delineates the thing's existence.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014/&gt; Yet, as proposed in the ''[[History of Animals]]'', many creatures form not through sexual processes but by spontaneous generation:

{{quote|Now there is one property that animals are found to have in common with plants. For some plants are generated from the seed of plants, whilst other plants are self-generated through the formation of some elemental principle similar to a seed; and of these latter plants some derive their nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow inside other plants ... So with animals, some spring from parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow spontaneously and not from kindred stock; and of these instances of spontaneous generation some come from putrefying earth or vegetable matter, as is the case with a number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their several organs.&lt;ref name="HistAnimV"&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson | title=History of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/ | accessdate=2008-12-20 | volume=| origyear=c. 343 BCE | year=1910 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book V | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/book5.html | isbn=90-6186-973-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Part 1}}

According to this theory, living things may come forth from nonliving things in a manner roughly analogous to the "enformation of the female matter by the agency of the male seed" seen in sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonliving materials, like the seminal fluid present in sexual generation, contain ''[[pneuma]]'' (πνεῦμα, "breath"), or "[[vital heat]]". According to Aristotle, pneuma had more "heat" than regular air did, and this heat endowed the substance with certain vital properties:
{{quote|The power of every soul seems to have shared in a different and more divine body than the so called [four] elements ... For every [animal], what makes the seed generative inheres in the seed and is called its "heat." But this is not fire or some such power, but instead the pneuma that is enclosed in the seed and in foamy matter, this being analogous to the element of the stars. This is why fire does not generate any animal ... but the heat of the sun and the heat of animals does, not only the heat that fills the seed, but also any other residue of [the animal's] nature that may exist similarly possesses this vital principle.|Aristotle|''[[Generation of Animals]]'', 736b29ff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle drew an analogy between the "foamy matter" (τὸ ἀφρῶδες) found in nature and the "seed" of an animal, which he viewed as being a kind of foam itself (composed, as it was, from a mixture of water and pneuma). For Aristotle, the generative materials of male and female animals (semen and menstrual blood) were essentially refinements, made by male and female bodies according to their respective proportions of heat, of ingested food, which was, in turn, a byproduct of the elements earth and water. Thus any creature, whether generated sexually from parents or spontaneously through the interaction of vital heat and elemental matter, was dependent on the proportions of pneuma and the various elements which Aristotle believed comprised all things.&lt;ref name="Lehoux2017p26"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle recognized that many living things emerged from putrefying matter, he pointed out that the putrefaction was not the source of life, but the byproduct of the action of the "sweet" element of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by Arthur Platt | title=On the Generation of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/ | accessdate=2009-01-09 | origyear=c. 350 BCE | year=1912 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book III | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/book3.html | isbn=90-04-09603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Animals and plants come into being in earth and in liquid because there is water in earth, and air in water, and in all air is vital heat so that in a sense all things are full of soul. Therefore living things form quickly whenever this air and vital heat are enclosed in anything. When they are so enclosed, the corporeal liquids being heated, there arises as it were a frothy bubble.|Aristotle|''[[Generation of Animals]]'', Book III, Part 11}}

[[File:Argopecten irradians.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle stated that [[scallop]]s form spontaneously in sand.&lt;ref name=HistAnimV/&gt;]]

With varying degrees of observational confidence, Aristotle theorized the spontaneous generation of a range of creatures from different sorts of inanimate matter. The [[testacea]]ns (a genus which for Aristotle included [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and snails), for instance, were characterized by spontaneous generation from mud, but differed based upon the precise material they grew in—for example, [[clam]]s and [[scallop]]s in sand, [[oyster]]s in slime, and the [[barnacle]] and the [[limpet]] in the hollows of rocks.&lt;ref name=HistAnimV/&gt;

===Latin and early Christian sources===
[[Vitruvius]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[architect]] and writer of the 1st century BCE, advised that [[libraries]] be placed facing eastwards to benefit from morning light, but not towards the south or the west as those winds generate [[Bookworm (insect)|bookworms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Marcus Vitruvius Pollio | authorlink=Vitruvius | editor=Joseph Gwilt (translator) | others=electronic format by Bill Thayer |title=On Architecture (de Architectura) | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/home.html | accessdate=2009-02-03 | volume=Book VI | origyear=c. 25 BCE | year=1826 | publisher=Priestley and Weale | location=London | chapter=Part 4 | chapterurl=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/6*.html#4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] did not argue against the anatomic limits of eels, but stated that eels reproduce by budding, scraping themselves against rocks, liberating particles that become eels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Gaius Plinius Secundus | authorlink=Pliny the Elder | editor=[[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]] | title=Natural History | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc | accessdate=2009-02-03 | volume= BOOK IX.

On the other hand, Athenaeus also dissented towards spontaneous generation, claiming that a variety of [[anchovy]] did not generate from [[roe]], as Aristotle stated, but rather, from [[sea foam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Athenaeus of Naucratis | authorlink=Athenaeus | editor=Yonge, C.D. | title=The deipnosophists, or, Banquet of the learned of Athenæus | url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=browse&amp;scope=Literature.DeipnoSub | accessdate=2009-02-03 | series=University of Wisconsin Digital Collection | volume= I | publisher=Henry G.

As the dominant view of philosophers and thinkers continued to be in favour of spontaneous generation, some Christian theologians accepted the view. [[Augustine of Hippo]] discussed spontaneous generation in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' and ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'', citing Biblical passages such as "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:20|KJV|}}) as decrees that would enable ongoing creation.&lt;ref name ="irisfry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry | first=Iris | title=The Emergence of Life on Earth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA17,M1| chapter=Chapter 2: Spontaneous Generation — Ups and Downs | accessdate=2009-01-21 | year=2000 | publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]] in 5th century to the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, the influence of Greek science declined, although spontaneous generation generally went unchallenged. New descriptions were made. Of the numerous beliefs, some had doctrinal implications outside of the [[Book of Genesis]]. For example, the idea that a variety of bird known as the ''[[barnacle goose#Folklore|barnacle goose]]'' emerged from a crustacean known as the ''[[goose barnacle]]'', had implications on the practice of fasting during [[Lent]].  In 1188, [[Gerald of Wales]], after having traveled in Ireland, argued that the "unnatural" generation of barnacle geese was evidence for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Giraldus Cambrensis | authorlink=Gerald of Wales | title=Topographia Hiberniae | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1188geraldwales-barnacle.html | accessdate=2009-02-01 | year=1188 | isbn=0-85105-386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the practice of fasting during Lent allowed fish, but prohibited fowl, the idea that the goose was in fact a fish suggested that its consumption be permitted during Lent. The practice was eventually prohibited by decree of [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lankester | first=Sir Edwin Ray | authorlink=Edwin Lankester | title=Diversions of a Naturalist | url=https://books.google.com/?id=d1GnwwmfvC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate= 2009-02-01 | edition=illustrated | origyear=1915 | year=1970 | publisher=Ayer Publishing | isbn=978-0-8369-1471-9 |pages=117–128 | chapter=XIV.

Aristotle, in Arabic translation, was reintroduced to Western Europe.  During the 13th century, Aristotle reached his greatest acceptance. With the availability of Latin translations Saint [[Albertus Magnus]] and his student, Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], raised Aristotelianism to its greatest prominence. Albert wrote a paraphrase of Aristotle, ''De causis et processu universitatis'', in which he removed some and incorporated other commentaries by Arabic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | date=March 20, 2006 | contribution=Albert the Great | contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/albert-great/ | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N.

Spontaneous generation is discussed as a fact in literature well into the [[Renaissance]].  Where, in passing, [[Shakespeare]] discusses snakes and crocodiles forming from the mud of the [[Nile]] ({{Shakecite|Ant|F1|2|7}}), [[Izaak Walton]] again raises the question of the origin of eels "as rats and mice, and many other living creatures, are bred in Egypt, by the sun's heat when it shines upon the overflowing of the river...". While the ancient question of the origin of eels remained unanswered and the additional idea that eels reproduced from corruption of age was mentioned, the spontaneous generation of rats and mice engendered no debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Walton | first=Izaak | authorlink=Izaak Walton | others=transcribed by Risa Bear | title=The Compleat Angler or the Contemplative Man's Recreation | url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~rbear/walton/index.html | accessdate=2009-02-05 | origyear=1653 | year=1903  | publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons  | chapter=XIII.

The Dutch biologist and microscopist [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637 - 1680) rejected the concept that one animal could arise from another or from putrification by chance because it was impious and like others found the concept of spontaneous generation irreligious, and he associated it with atheism and Godless opinion.&lt;ref name="OslerFarber2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Osler, Margaret J. |author2=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S.

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1580–1644) used experimental techniques, such as growing a willow for five years and showing it increased mass while the soil showed a trivial decrease in comparison.  As the process of [[photosynthesis]] was not understood, he attributed the increase of mass to the absorption of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Ducheyne | first=Steffen | year=2006 | title=Joan Baptista van Helmont and the Question of Experimental Modernism | pages=305–332 | url=http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/Physis%20-%20Van%20Helmont.pdf | accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notes also describe a recipe for mice (a piece of soiled cloth plus wheat for 21 days) and scorpions (basil, placed between two bricks and left in sunlight).

The ancient beliefs were subjected to testing.  In 1668, [[Francesco Redi]] challenged the idea that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.  In the first major [[experiment]] to challenge spontaneous generation, he placed meat in a variety of sealed, open, and partially covered containers.&lt;ref name="slowdeath"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/cellintro/cellintro_reading/Spontaneous_Generation.html | title=The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859) | accessdate=2008-12-19 | author=Levine, Russell |author2=Evers, Chris | year=1999 | publisher=National Health Museum | location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Realizing that the sealed containers were deprived of air, he used "fine Naples veil", and observed no worm on the meat, but they appeared on the cloth.&lt;ref name="fredi"&gt;{{cite book | author=Redi, Francesco | authorlink=Francesco Redi |editor=Mab Bigelow (translator) | title=Experiments on the Generation of Insects | url=https://books.google.com/?id=w7ZRAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Francesco+Redi+experiment&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate=2008-12-19 | origyear=1669 | year=1909 | publisher=Open Court | location=Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redi used his experiments to support the preexistence theory put forth by the Church at that time, which maintained that living things originated from parents.&lt;ref name="Fry2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fry, Iris |title=Emergence of Life on Earth: A Historical and Scientific Overview |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;pg=PA27 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |date=1 February 2000 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6 |pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scientific circles Redi's work very soon had great influence, as evidenced in a letter from [[John Ray]] in 1671 to members of the [[Royal Society]] of London:

{{quote|Whether there be any spontaneous or anomalous generation of animals, as has been the constant opinion of naturalists heretofore, I think there is good reason to question. It seems to me at present most probable, that there is no such thing; but that even all insects are the natural issue of parents of the same species with themselves. F. Redi has gone a good way in proving this, having cleared the point concerning generation ''ex materia putrida''. But still there remain two great difficulties. The first is, to give an account of the production of insects bred in the by-fruits and excrescencies of vegetables, which the said Redi doubts not to ascribe to the vegetative soul of the plant that yields those excrescencies. But for this I refer you to Mr. Lister. The second, to render an account of insects bred in the bodies of other animals. I hope shortly to be able to give you an account of the generation of some of those insects which have been thought to be spontaneous, and which seem as unlikely as any to be after the ordinary and usual way.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Society (Great Britain); Hutton, Charles, 1737-1823; Shaw, George, 1751-1813; Pearson, Richard, 1765-1836.

[[Pier Antonio Micheli]], around 1729, observed that when fungal spores were placed on slices of melon the same type of fungi were produced that the spores came from, and from this observation he noted that fungi did not arise from spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Agrios2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnzbgZgby60C&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-044565-3 |pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, [[John Needham]] performed a series of experiments on boiled broths.  Believing that boiling would kill all living things, he showed that when sealed right after boiling, the broths would cloud, allowing the belief in spontaneous generation to persist.  His studies were rigorously scrutinized by his peers and many of them agreed.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt;

[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] modified the Needham experiment in 1768, attempting to exclude the possibility of introducing a contaminating factor between boiling and sealing. His technique involved boiling the broth in a sealed container with the air partially evacuated to prevent explosions.  Although he did not see growth, the exclusion of air left the question of whether air was an essential factor in spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, by that time there was already widespread scepticism among major scientists, to the principle of spontaneous generation. Observation was increasingly demonstrating that whenever there was sufficiently careful investigation of mechanisms of biological reproduction, it was plain that processes involved basing of new structures on existing complex structures, rather from chaotic muds or dead materials. [[Joseph Priestley]], after he had fled to America and not long before his death, wrote a letter that was read to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1803. It said in part:

{{quote|There is nothing in modern philosophy that appears to me so extraordinary, as the revival of what has long been considered as the exploded doctrine of equivocal, or, as Dr. Darwin calls it, spontaneous generation; by which is meant the production of organized bodies from substances that have no organization, as plants and animals from no pre-existing germs of the same kinds, plants without seeds, and animals without sexual intercourse.

The germ of an organized body, the seed of a plant, or the embrio of an animal, in its first discoverable state, is now found to be the future plant or animal in miniature, containing every thing essential to it when full grown, only requiring to have the several organs enlarged, and the interstices filled with extraneous nutritious matter. When the external form undergoes the greatest change, as from an aquatic insect to a flying gnat, a caterpillar to a crysalis, a crysalis to a butterfly, or a tadpole to a frog, there is nothing new in the organization; all the parts of the gnat, the butterfly, and the frog, having really existed, though not appearing to the common observer in the forms in which they are first seen. In like manner, every thing essential to the oak is found in the acorn.&lt;ref name="PriestleySG" &gt;Priestley, Joseph.

In 1837, [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]], a physicist, and [[Theodor Schwann]], one of the founders of cell theory, published their independent discovery of [[yeast]] in [[alcoholic fermentation]].  They used the [[microscope]] to examine foam left over from the process of brewing [[beer]].  Where [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] described "small spheroid globules", they observed yeast cells undergo [[cell division]].  Fermentation would not occur when sterile air or pure oxygen was introduced if yeast were not present.  This suggested that airborne [[microorganisms]], not spontaneous generation, was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Springer | first=Alfred | date=October 13, 1892 | title=The Micro-organisms of the Soil | journal=Nature | volume=46 | issue=1198 | pages=576–579 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | issn=0028-0836| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT138&amp;lpg=PT138 | doi=10.1038/046576b0|bibcode=1892Natur..46R.576. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the idea of spontaneous generation had been in decline for nearly a century, its supporters did not abandon it all at once. As [[James Rennie]] wrote:

{{quote|...inability to trace the origin of minute plants and insects led to the doctrine of what is called spontaneous or equivocal generation, of which the fancies above-mentioned are some 'of the prominent branches. The experiments of Redi on the hatching of insects from eggs, which were published at Florence in 1668, first brought discredit upon this doctrine, though it had always a few eminent disciples. At present it is maintained by a considerable number -of distinguished naturalists, such as Blumenbach, Cuvier, Bory de St. Vincent, R. Brown, &amp;c. "The notion or spontaneous generation," says Bory, " is at first revolting to a rational mind, but it is, notwithstanding, demonstrable by the microscope. The fact is averred : Willer has seen it, I have seen it, and twenty other observers have seen it: the pandorinia exhibit it every instant. "These pandorinia he elsewhere describes as probably nothing more than " animated scions of Zoocarpae".  It would be unprofitable to go into any lengthened discussion upon this mysterious subject; and we have great doubts whether the ocular demonstration by the microscope would succeed except in the hands of a disciple of the school. Even with naturalists, whose business it is to deal with facts, the reason is often wonderfully influenced by the imagination...&lt;ref name=JRIT&gt;Rennie, James. Insect Transformations. Page 10.

===Pasteur and Tyndall===

[[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment is widely seen as having settled the question of spontaneous generation.  He boiled a meat broth in a flask that had a long neck that curved downward, like that of a goose or swan.  The idea was that the bend in the neck prevented falling particles from reaching the broth, while still allowing the free flow of air.  The flask remained free of growth for an extended period.  When the flask was turned so that particles could fall down the bends, the broth quickly became clouded.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, minority objections were persistent and not always unreasonable, given that the experimental difficulties were far more challenging than the popular accounts suggest. The investigations of [[John Tyndall]], a correspondent of Pasteur and a great admirer of Pasteur's work, were decisive in disproving spontaneous generation and dealing with lingering issues. Still, even Tyndall encountered difficulties in dealing with the effects of [[Endospore |microbial spores]], which were not well understood in his day. Like Pasteur, he boiled his cultures to sterilize them, and some types of bacterial spores can survive boiling. The [[autoclave]], which eventually came into universal application in medical practice and microbiology to sterilise equipment, was not an instrument that had come into use at the time of Tyndall's experiments, let alone those of Pasteur.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"/&gt;

In 1862, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] paid a special attention to the issue and established a prize "to him who by well-conducted experiments throws new light on the question of the so-called spontaneous generation" and appointed a commission to judge the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engelhardt |first1=Hugo Tristram |last2=Caplan |first2=Arthur L. |title=Scientific Controversies: Case Studies in the Resolution and Closure of Disputes in Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nkSX63VsLkC&amp;pg=PA107 |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-27560-6 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Student orientation''' or '''new student orientation''' (often encapsulated into an '''Orientation week''', '''Frosh Week''', '''Welcome Week'''&lt;ref&gt;)[http://www.ofyp.umn.edu/en/welcome-week.html Welcome Week&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Freshers' Week''') is a period before the start of an academic year at a [[university]] or [[tertiary education|tertiary]] institutions. A variety of events are held to orient and welcome new [[students]] during this period. The name of the period varies by country.

Although usually described as a ''week'', the length of this period varies widely from university to university and country to country, ranging from about three days to a month or even more (e.g. four or five weeks, depending on program, at [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers]]). The length of the week is often affected by each university's tradition as well as financial and physical constraints. During this period, students participate in a wide range of social activities.

==Terminology==

The week before the term starts is known as: ''Frosh'' (or ''frosh week'') in some{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} colleges and universities in Canada. In the US, most call it by the acronym SOAR for Student Orientation And Registration;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=Student+Orientation+And+Registration|title=Student Orientation And Registration - Google Search|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Freshers' week'' in the majority of the United Kingdom and Ireland and ''Orientation week'' or ''O-week'' in countries such as Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, and also in many Canadian universities.  In Sweden, it is known as ''nollning'' (from ''nolla'', "zero", in this case meaning the students have not earned any credit points yet) or ''inspark'' (being "kicked in" to university life). Orientation week is the coming phrase{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} in the United States.  Some schools use the acronym WOW for Week of Welcome.

In Canada, first-year students are called "Frosh" or "first-years". The terms "freshies" and "freshers" are also emerging. In the United States, first-year university students are typically{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} referred to as [[First year|freshmen]]. In Australia and New Zealand, first-year students are known simply as "first-years", although in some the colleges of the [[University of Melbourne]] and the [[University of Sydney]] they are also called "Freshers". In the U.K. and Ireland first-year students are known as ''freshers'' or ''first-years''. ''Freshies'' is also an emerging term in New Zealand. In Sweden, the student is a ''nolla'' (a "zero") during the orientation period and usually upgraded to the status of an ''etta'' (student who is in her/his first college term) at a ceremony involving a fancy three-course dinner and a lots of singing.

==Around the world==
===Australia===
In Australia, some universities require students to arrive at university a week before classes start in order to gain course approval. This also allows students a chance to orient themselves to student life without the pressure of lectures—hence the term ''Orientation week'' is used to describe this week of induction into university life.

In Australian universities, such as the [[University of Melbourne]], [[University of New South Wales]] and [[University of Sydney]], the last or second last night is usually celebrated with a large-scale event such as a famous band playing at an entertainment venue on campus. This is generally followed by continued partying and drinking, especially among students living in [[residential college]]s such as [[Janet Clarke Hall]] and [[Ormond College]].

The [[Adelaide University]] O-Week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/student/new/oweek/timetbl/auu.html|title=Orientation|website=www.adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs from Monday to Thursday in the week before lectures begin. During O-Week sporting clubs and societies set up a variety of tented areas where clubs display their activities. The [[Adelaide University Union]] coordinates a variety of events centering around beer, bands and barbecues on the lawns near the Union complex. A major event for the week is the O-Ball (live entertainment and licensed areas) which takes place in the Cloisters (Union House). The O-Ball attracts many thousands of revellers, not all of whom are Adelaide University students. In recent times [[Adelaide University Sports Association|Sports]] and Clubs have sought to distance themselves from the student union and [[SAUA|student association]] controlled activities and have set themselves up on the Maths lawns.

The [[Australian National University]] has a full week (Sunday to Sunday)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.anu.edu.au/events/o-week]&lt;/ref&gt; of events, parties and social activities open to all students of the university, organised by the [[Australian National University Students Association]]. The residential colleges often have their own "O-week" activities catered primarily for residents as well as the annual "Burgmann Toga Party" held at [[Burgmann College]] open to students from all residential colleges. "Burgmann Toga" is the largest party held at a university residence in the Southern Hemisphere.

[[File:Frosh2006.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Winters College Frosh Students and Bosses playing icebreakers during O-Week at [[York University]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2006]]

===Canada===
In Canada, the nature and length of orientation week varies considerably between Universities. For instance, [[Ottawa]], has two universities within its urban centre; the [[University of Ottawa]] and [[Carleton University]], both with orientations spanning approximately 7 days. At The University of Ottawa, Frosh Week is Called 101 week. At Carleton University there are multiple orientations, SPROSH (Sprott Frosh), ENG Frosh, Radical Frosh, and the largest, CUSA/RRRA/SEO Frosh.
In the province of [[Quebec]], because of the [[CEGEP]] system, "froshies" are of legal [[drinking age]] and Frosh activities may include the option to drink alcohol. Moreover, the proximity of the two Ottawa universities also allows them to take advantage of the drinking age in neighbouring [[Gatineau]], Quebec.  The [[University of British Columbia]] cancels the first day of class for all students, and hosts an orientation day for new students, called Imagine Day.  As of 2007, the Faculty of Science also holds an annual, day-long Science Frosh event for approximately 300 first-year students, while the commerce faculty holds a 3-day-long frosh weekend before classes begin. The [[University of Toronto]] has a number of different "Frosh Weeks" organized concurrently by different student groups within the university; including college societies, professional faculties (perhaps the best known being organized by Engineering Society, [[Skule (engineering society)]], in which 'F!ROSH' and 'F!ROSH Leedurs' dye their bodies purple) and the University of Toronto Students' Union. Similarly, [[Ryerson University]] also has a number of "Frosh Weeks" organized by different student groups, although it also has a central frosh team known as the 'Ryerson Orientation Crew'. At the Friday of frosh week, the Ryerson Students' Union holds a concert that is free for all Ryerson students; the headliners for the 2015 concert included [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] and [[Future (rapper)|Future]]. McMaster University also organizes many events during what they term "Welcome Week". The week strongly encourages solidarity, first with members of one's own residence or for off-campus students, and later the members of a student's faculty.  [[University of Guelph]] holds many orientation activities for its incoming students.  The main event is the pep rally in which students from each residence perform a dance on the football field.  The Guelph Engineering Society also hosts a series of special events for Engineering Frosh including frosh olympics, beach day, and a scavenger hunt. [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]] hosts the largest orientation program in Canada, involving 1200 student volunteers and an entire week of activities. St Thomas University, in Fredericton, New Brunswick, hosts a week-long event including activities for each residence and activities for new students.  As a rule, Frosh week at [[Queen's University]] is so secretive and confidential that no one knows what happens during the week long adventure except Queen's Students and Alumni.  [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] has by definition a Lit orientation week.

===Finland===
[[File:First year student orientation, University of Tampere, Finland, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|200px|First-year "fuksi" (tursas) student orientation, Tampere University of Applied Sciences, Finland, 2014]]

In Finnish universities, the student organizations for each department independently organize orientation activities for the new students in their respective departments. New students are often assigned in groups to an upperclassman tutor and participate in many activities with their tutoring group. New students may be referred to as ''piltti'' (child), ''fuksi'' (freshman), ''fetus'' or other names according to their major subject. Activities for new students may include "orienteering", pub crawls, sporting events, swimming in fountains or other forms of "baptism", [[sitsit]] parties and saunas, often done wearing homemade fancy-dress costumes. It is also considered important for the new students to participate in the regular activities of the student department organizations.

[[File:OSPEK.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Indonesia student orientation better known as OSPEK (Student Orientation and Campus Introduction)]]

===Indonesia===
In past years a typical orientation may consist of verbal harassment as well as initiation leading to humiliation. An orientation of freshers in Indonesia is usually called OSPEK for some universities and MOS in middle and high school. Orientations in Indonesia has event organizers that consists of seniors and the presidium of universities. The most basic form of orientation in Indonesia consist of an educational board run and introduction of campus cultural behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kampus.okezone.com/read/2010/08/18/373/364282/ribuan-mahasiswa-baru-ui-jalani-orientasi|title=Okezone Kampus : Berita seputar kampus dan Informasi beasiswa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What makes orientation in Indonesia (for some universities and schools) distinctive to other countries would arguably be the freshmens' requirement to wear unusual accessories or hairstyles (i.e. Freshmens were asked to wear hats made of bird's nest, [[necktie]] made of folded paper, military hairstyle for male students or intricate braids for females, and the usage of a sack instead of a rucksack). Harsh physical punishments were not uncommon during the [[Suharto]] era, and mass media continues to report inhumane activities during those orientation that led to a few cases of death.

Nowadays, however, orientation is more tolerable as physical abuse is now forbidden by the law, however it is still criticized by many psychologists and people as 'too much' because of excessive verbal harassment like dissing and insulting the juniors, and the usage of unusual and humiliating attributes typically found in orientations on Junior High and High Schools. As well, it is also criticized by many parents for being economically inconvenient. The reason cited by psychologists is that orientation is often used as a tool of revenge done by the board of organizers for what the seniors did to them during their freshman year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edukasi.kompasiana.com/2010/07/13/ospek-hal-terbodoh-dalam-dunia-pendidikan/|title=Ospek: Hal Terbodoh dalam Dunia Pendidikan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And because of this there are so many people who believes that "MOS" or "OSPEK" is a useless traditions that needs to be erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabarindonesia.com/berita.php?pil=20&amp;jd=Masih+Perlukah+OSPEK?&amp;dn=20100422001753|title=Masih Perlukah OSPEK? - HOKI - Harian Online KabarIndonesia|website=www.kabarindonesia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detiknews.com/read/2010/07/13/052824/1397930/10/mos-tidak-perlu-jika-hanya-jadi-ajang-perploncoan|title=detikNews - Berita hari ini di Indonesia dan Internasional|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'cruelty' of MOS and OSPEK varies between universities and schools in Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indrani.net/index.php?q=2007/04/plonco_ospek_hazing|title=Plonco, Ospek, Hazing|website=indrani.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in (most) major universities and institutes that kind of humiliation and harassment doesn't exist anymore, or greatly limited to pending applicants or pledges for certain campus organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://oskmitb2013.com/index.php/home/single&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
As in Australia, in New Zealand students have a week to orient themselves to university life before the start of formal classes. This ''orientation week'' is a time for many social events, and is often a reason for alcohol fests.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Riordan, R. B., Scarf, D., &amp; Conner, T. S. |year=2015 |title=Is orientation week a gateway to persistent alcohol use in university students? A preliminary investigation. |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs |volume=76 |pages=204–2011 |doi=10.15288/jsad.2015.76.204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat warmings are often held within the time limit to couple the alcohol oriented event with the general party week.

In New Zealand's main university towns such as [[Dunedin]] and [[Palmerston North]] (where students make up around one fifth of the population) orientation week leads a wide range of events. Many top overseas and local bands tour the country at this time, and the orientation tour is one of the highlights of the year's music calendar. The [[University of Otago]] in the Scottish-settled city of Dunedin traditionally holds a parody of the [[Highland Games]] called the ''Lowland Games'', including such esoteric events as porridge wrestling.

Student pranks were once common during orientation week, but have fallen out of favour in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Until recent years, many [[hall of residence|halls of residence]] also inducted new residents with "Initiation" (a form of [[hazing]], though considerably milder than the rituals found among American [[college fraternities]]).

Although officially designated as a week, in several New Zealand universities and polytechnics orientation week stretches to over ten days.

===Sweden===
Most Swedish universities have some kind of ''nollning'' ("''zeroing''") or "inspark" ("kicking-in"). This is most extensive at the technical faculties and at the [[student nation]] communities of [[Uppsala university|Uppsala]] and [[Lund University|Lund]]. Since [[Students' union|student union]] membership was mandatory in Sweden (until July 2010), the nollning is usually centrally organized from the student union with support from the universities.

At the old universities, these traditions have often turned civilized after a dark history of hazing. Today, many student unions have strict rules against inappropriate drunkenness, sexual harassment and other problematic behaviour.

At the technical faculties, the people who organize the nollning play roles in a theatrical manner and often wear sunglasses and some form of weird clothes. Most senior students who are mentors during the nollning wear their [[student boilersuit]]s or the b-frack (a worn [[tailcoat]]). This kind of organized nollning developed at [[KTH]] and [[Chalmers Institute of Technology|Chalmers]] and spread to the rest of the country.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, the activity is commonly called ''rapnong'' (รับน้อง), translated as "welcoming of freshmen". It takes place in the first week or month of the academic year at universities and some high schools. The purpose is to adapt new students to university culture. Activities include games, entertainment and recreation. These let the newcomers get to know other members of the university and reduce tension in the changing environment. It sometimes includes alcohol. The main object is to let juniors carry on the universities' tradition and identity and to bind together the new generation into one. Long-term activity often includes seniors taking freshman or older years to meals and meetings, usually the most senior pays for it all. [[Hazing]] is a concern in this activity, as many students have been humiliated, abused, and dehumanized by their upperclassmen.

For over 50 years, SOTUS – a [[Hazing]] based system used for college initiation in Thailand – has been involved in Thai universities. It stands for Seniority, Order, Tradition, Unity, and Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saengpassa|first1=Chularat|title=SOTUS activities : Is it time to stop old system of seniority, tradition?|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/SOTUS-ACTIVITIES-IS-IT-TIME-TO-CHANGE-OLD-SYSTEM-O-30157656.html.|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the system for freshmen to bring harmony to their friends and to show their pride through their institute. By seniors, freshmen have to do activities such as singing university songs. Moreover, freshmen are required to do a lot of things; for example, wear a nametag, and show respect to seniors. These requirements lead seniors to try to make their juniors do what they desire and punish them if they don't do seniors' orders.

Presently, there are adolescents and adults opposing those who had committed unethical or deadly actions to juniors. This group of adolescents has distributed "Anti-SOTUS"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti- SOTUS.|url=https://th-th.facebook.com/AntiSOTUSPage.|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; group and it becomes one of the main issues in Thailand recently. They consider the SOTUS system to be "old-fashioned and source of brutality". Since it was established, this has become the group of people who share their opinions about SOTUS system based on how they have encountered it.

On the other hand, some seniors that support this system resisting the anti SOTUS attitude for many years. They tend to say that SOTUS makes them get along together and feel proud of themselves by becoming part of their institute. Some seniors, however, coerce their freshmen to attend every activity held by them as parts of preparing them to be able to live happily in university. These become worse when some freshmen suffer from what their senior have done to them.

In Thai society, news related to this system has been reported almost every year. For example, recent news about a male freshman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Intathep|first1=Lamphai|title=Teen dies in Hua Hin beach 'initiation' rite|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/429973/hazing-death-college-probed.|accessdate=21 November 2014|publisher=Bangkokpost|date=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who died in this tradition. This news has resulted in people thinking that rapnong should end or, at least, be controlled.

As well as providing a chance to learn about the university, ''Freshers' week'' allows students to become familiar with the representatives of their [[Student Union]] and to get to know the city or town which is home to the university, often through some form of [[pub crawl]] (the legal drinking age is 18 in the UK and in Ireland).

Live music is also common, as are a number of organized social gatherings especially designed to allow freshers to make new friends and to get to know their course colleagues. Because of the intensity of activities, there are often many new friendships made, especially in group accommodation, some not lasting past Freshers' Week and others lasting for the whole University career and longer.

Typically a ''Freshers' Fair'' for student clubs and societies is included as part of the activities to introduce new students to facilities on offer, typically outside their course of study, such as societies, clubs and sports. The various societies and clubs available within the University have stalls and aim to entice freshers to join.  Most campuses take the opportunity to promote safe sex to their students and sometimes offer leaflets on the subject and free [[condom]]s, as well as promoting the Drinksafe campaign. The  aim is to lower the rate of sexually transmitted disease and to reduce the level of intoxication commonly witnessed in Freshers' Week.

[[Freshers' Flu]] is a predominately British term which describes the increased rates of illness during the first few weeks of university. Although called ''Freshers' Flu'', it is often not a [[flu]] at all.

===United States===
[[File:Shimer College conversation with students 2010.jpg|thumb|Students and professor in conversation during orientation at [[Shimer College]].]]
"Freshmen" is the traditional term for first-year students arriving at school in the United States, but the slang term 'frosh'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/frosh|title=the definition of frosh|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also used. Due to the perceived gender exclusiveness of the term, some institutions including the [[University of North Carolina]] have adopted "first-year student" as the preferred nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc24.com/news/story.aspx?id=816482|date=2012-10-23|accessdate=2015-01-10|first=Norm|last=Van Ness|title='Freshman' title dumped for more P.C. 'First Year Student' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasting between a few days and a week, the orientation is these students' informal introduction and inauguration to the institution.  Typically, the first-year students are led by fellow students from upper years over the course of the week through various events ranging from campus tours, games, competitions, and field trips.  At smaller [[liberal arts college]]s, the faculty may also play a central role in orientation.

In many colleges, incoming freshmen are made to perform activities such as singing of songs, engaging in group physical activities, and playing games. These activities are often done to help freshmen make friends at their new establishment, and also to bond with each other and the upperclassmen.

Despite the fact that most first-year students are below the legal drinking age (currently 21 years in all states), heavy drinking and [[binge drinking]] may occur outside the orientation curriculum. Some programs require their organizers to sign waivers stating they will not be under the influence of any substances over the course of the week as they are responsible for the well-being of the students.  Most programs have one final party on the final night to finish off the week of celebrating, in which the organizers join in.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Although it has been officially banned at many schools, [[hazing]] is not uncommon during the week.  This can be anywhere from the organizers treating the first-year students in a playfully discouraging manner to forcing them to endure rigorous trials.

The attitude of the events also depends on the school. Many colleges encourage parents to come to the first day to help new students move into their [[dormitory]], fill out paper work, and get situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.case.edu/orientation/parent/|title=New Students - New Students - Case Western Reserve University|website=studentaffairs.case.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools view their week as an initiation or rite of passage while others view it as a time to build school spirit and pride.  In towns with more than one university, there may be a school rivalry that is reflected in the events throughout the week.

At most schools, incoming freshmen arrive at the school for a couple of days during the summer and are put into orientation groups led by an upperclassman trained for the position. Their Orientation Leader will take them around campus, do activities with them, have discussions with them, help them register for the next semester's classes and make them feel comfortable about coming to school in the fall.

Freshmen orientation is usually mandatory for all new students, especially international students which is one way to activate the status of their visa.

====United States Transfer Student Orientation====

After first-year students have completed some time at their university, they may find that they did not make the right choice, miss being close to home, or simply want to attend a different institution. When this occurs, they may transfer to another university, usually after their first year.

Many universities will hold another student orientation similar to freshman orientation for these transfer students. Freshman orientation lasts a few days or a week, on the other hand, transfer student orientation will typically last between one and three days. Transfer orientation's purpose is to acquaint transfer students with their new university.  This usually includes campus tours, introducing transfer students to their adviser or perhaps a few of their teachers, and filling out paperwork for proper enrollment.  At some colleges, transfer orientation is mandatory for all transfer students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullerton.edu/explore/transfer/tso.htm|title=Admissions and Records - Home|website=www.fullerton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike freshmen, transfer students are already familiar with the independence of college life. Therefore, their orientation focuses mostly on becoming familiar with the layout and policies of their new institution, providing information about essential campus resources, and getting acquainted with other transfer students so they may make friends at their new university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofyp.umn.edu/en/tr-preparing-for-orientation.html|title=Preparing for Orientation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transfer students may engage in games, conversations with University faculty, and discussions with current students to make acquaintances and learn more about the university.

===Denmark===

At ''Roskilde University'' in Denmark, orientation week (in Danish ''rusvejledning'') normally lasts from 1 week and a half to two whole weeks. During the period, approximately 14 teams consisting of 10–16 tutors each takes care of an individual ''house'' in which the new students have been allocated. There's normally 1 house of Natural Sciences, 4 of Social Studies and Economics, 4 houses of Arts and Language and 2 of technology and design. Each of the first 3 houses described has an International version as well, where the courses are taught in English instead of Danish.

Each tutor group spends roughly 14 days (and 3–5 days of preeducation in the spring semester) living on campus before the arrival of the new students (also called ''ruslings''). These periods usually involve heavy amounts of drinking, partying and sexual activity among the tutors themselves. However most festive activities including alcohol only occurs until after 4 pm, due to the alcohol policies of the university. Because of this policy, most of the daily activity is spent on planning and preparing activities for the new students.

When the students arrive all tutor groups welcomes the ''ruslings'' with the infamous ''Marbjergmark show- ''usually a display of wacky sketches such as naked people playing chess, smashing rotten eggs at bystanders or themselves or guys chasing midgets with a butcher's knife (to name a few examples).

During the two-week period the tutor group teach and introduce the new students to life at campus. Both the social and educational aspects. As it is with the preparation period, festive activities take place after 4 PM, and educational activities are held during the day.

The two-week period ends in a four-day period in which the ''house'' will leave campus to varied destinations. During these days mostly social activities are held, including the more secret hazing rituals of the university.

The tutors uphold a strict set of rules to maintain a safe and pleasant tutorship to prevent harmful and humiliating hazing rituals. Examples are the presence of minimum two sober tutors at each party (In Danish ''Ædruvagter''). Engaging in sexual relations with new students is also strongly discouraged. Also it is generally not seen as appropriate to force people to drink alcohol through various games and activities. Furthermore, the university dictates that each tutor must be taught basic first aid, as well as a couple of courses in conflict management and basic education psychology.

At ''DTU ''(''Danish Faculty of Technology and Engineering''), ''Copenhagen Business School'' and ''Copenhagen University'' similar periods are held. They however vary, and are significantly shorter than the overall orientation period spent on ''Roskilde University''.

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], the term '''subspecies''' refers to a unity of populations of a [[species]] living in a subdivision of the species' global range and varies  from other populations of the same species by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |year=1982 |title=Of what use are subspecies? |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=593−595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Monroe, B. L. |year=1982 |title=A modern concept of the subspecies |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=608−609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A subspecies cannot be recognized independently. A species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two, including any that are extinct. The term is abbreviated '''subsp.''' in [[botany]] and [[bacteriology]], or '''ssp.''' in [[zoology]]. The [[plural]] is the same as the singular: ''subspecies''.

In [[zoology]], under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], other [[infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks]], such as [[variety (botany)|variety]], may be named. In [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]], under standard [[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|bacterial nomenclature]] and [[virus classification|virus nomenclature]], there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.

A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies or not. A common criterion for a subspecies is its ability of [[interbreeding]] with a different subspecies of the same species and producing fertile offspring. In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to their [[Allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] and [[sexual selection]]. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.

==Nomenclature==
In [[zoology]], the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (4th edition, 1999) accepts only one rank below that of species, namely the rank of subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp "Index"]. ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''. Fourth Edition. [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. January 1, 2000. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groupings, "[[infrasubspecific]] entities" do not have names regulated by the ''ICZN''. Such forms have no official ''ICZN'' status, though they may be useful in describing altitudinal or geographical [[Cline (biology)|clines]], [[pet]] [[breed]]s, [[Transgenic animals#Transgenic animals|transgenic animals]], etc. While the scientific name of a species is a [[Binomial nomenclature|binomen]], the scientific name of a subspecies is a [[trinomen]] - a binomen followed by a subspecific name. A [[tiger]]'s binomen is ''Panthera tigris'', so for a [[Sumatran tiger]] the trinomen is, for example, ''Panthera tigris sumatrae''.  ''Subspecies'' is generally abbreviated as "ssp." in zoology, but is not used in scientific name.

In [[botany]], subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[subvariety]], [[form (botany)|form]], and subform. The subspecific name is preceded by "subsp.", as in ''Schoenoplectus californicus'' subsp. ''[[Totora (plant)|tatora]]''. A botanical name consists of at most three parts. An [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]] includes the species binomial, and one infraspecific epithet, such as subspecies or variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Mallet |title=Subspecies, semispecies, superspecies |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Sp/Sub-semi.pdf |website=ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Microbiology|bacteriology]], the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is ''subspecies'', but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of ''variety'' are taken to be names of subspecies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=icnb&amp;part=A185 "Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations"]. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes]]'').  As in botany, ''subspecies'' is conventionally abbreviated as "subsp.", and is used in the scientific name: ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' subsp. ''spizizenii''.&lt;ref name="ICNP 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |at="Names of Subspecies: Rule 13a"&lt;!--This document is not page-numbered.--&gt; |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (2008 Revision) |date=20 November 2015 |orig-year=2008 |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |edition=ICSP Matters |volume=|issue=&lt;!--Appears to have been a special stand-alone issue; no vol./issue numbers specified.--&gt; |first1=Charles T. |last1=Parker |first2=Brian J. |last2=Tindall |first3=George M. |last3=Garrity |doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000778|pmid=26596770 }} Full text available from PDF link at this page; direct URL to PDF is auto-generated and expires.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominotypical subspecies, and subspecies autonyms===
{{anchor|Nominate subspecies|Autonymous subspecies|Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms|reason=previous section names, and term anchors}}
In [[zoological nomenclature]], when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subspecies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=true&amp;article=47 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; or "nominate subspecies", which repeats the same name as the species. For example, ''Motacilla alba alba'' (often abbreviated ''M. a. alba'') is the nominotypical subspecies of the [[white wagtail]] (''Motacilla alba'').

The subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in [[botanical nomenclature]] as the subspecies "[[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]", and the subspecific taxon as the "autonymous subspecies".&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeill |first1=J. |last2=Barrie |first2=F. R. |last3=Buck |first3=W. R. |last4=Demoulin |first4=V. |last5=Greuter |first5=W. |last6=Hawksworth |first6=D. L. |last7=Herendeen |first7=P.

===Doubtful cases===
When zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus ''Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus'' means the [[American herring gull]]; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger [[European herring gull|herring gull]] species and therefore call it ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', while others consider it a full species and therefore call it ''Larus smithsonianus'' (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Criteria==
A subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species – the only recognized rank in the zoological code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |title=ICZN Glossary |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |editor1-first=Gary |editor1-last=Rosenberg |display-editors=etal |url= http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter J. |last1=Russell |first2=Paul E. |last2=Hertz |first3=Beverly |last3=McMillan |title=Biology: The Dynamic Science |publisher=Brooks/Cole California |date=2011 |chapter=21: Speciation |page=456 |isbn=978-1133418849 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jSw9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;

==Monotypic and polytypic species==
[[File:One horned Rhino.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis'') is a [[monotypic]] species]]
In biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a ''[[Polytypic taxon|polytypic]]'' species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, [[Race (biology)|races]], or more generally speaking, [[population]]s that need a separate description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, E. |author-link=Mayr, Ernst |title=Populations, Species, and Evolution: An Abridgment of Animal Species and Evolution |year=1970 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are separate groups that are clearly distinct from one another and do not generally interbreed, although there may be a relatively narrow hybridization zone, but which may interbreed if given the chance to do so. These subspecies, races, or populations, can be named as subspecies by zoologists, or in more varied ways by botanists and microbiologists.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]]'' species has no distinct population or races, or rather one race comprising the whole species. A taxonomist would not name a subspecies within such a species. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:
* All members of the species are very similar and cannot be sensibly divided into biologically significant subcategories.
* The individuals vary considerably, but the variation is essentially random and largely meaningless so far as genetic transmission of these variations is concerned.
* The variation among individuals is noticeable and follows a pattern, but there are no clear dividing lines among separate groups: they fade imperceptibly into one another. Such [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation always indicates substantial [[gene flow]] among the apparently separate groups that make up the population(s). Populations that have a steady, substantial gene flow among them are likely to represent a monotypic species, even when a fair degree of genetic variation is obvious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">'''Sutton's law''' states that when diagnosing, one should first consider the obvious. It suggests that one should first conduct those tests which could confirm (or rule out) the most likely diagnosis. It is taught in [[medical school]]s to suggest to medical students that they might best order tests in that sequence which is most likely to result in a quick diagnosis, hence treatment, while minimizing unnecessary costs. It is also applied in pharmacology, when choosing a drug to treat a specific disease you want the drug to reach the disease. It is applicable to any process of [[diagnosis]], e.g. [[debugging]] [[computer program]]s.  [[Computer-aided diagnosis]] provides a statistical and quantitative approach. 

A more thorough analysis will consider the [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] rate of the test and the possibility that a less likely diagnosis might have more serious consequences. A competing principle is the idea of performing simple tests before more complex and expensive tests, moving from bedside tests to blood results and simple imaging such as [[ultrasound]] and then more complex such as [[MRI]] then specialty imaging.  The law can also be applied in prioritizing tests when resources are limited, so a test for a treatable condition should be performed before an equally probable but less treatable condition.

The law is named after the bank robber [[Willie Sutton]], who reputedly replied to a reporter's inquiry as to why he robbed banks by saying "because that's where the money is." In Sutton's 1976 book ''Where the Money Was'', Sutton denies having said this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/willie-sutton/|title=FACT CHECK: Willie Sutton - 'That's Where the Money Is'|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willie Sutton with Edward Linn, ''Where the Money Was: The Memoirs of a Bank Robber'' (New York, New York:  Broadway Books, 2004; first published in 1976 by Viking Press of N.Y., N.Y.),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJvVaSMvDWcC&amp;pg=PT108&amp;lpg=PT108&amp;dq=confess+never&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=confess%20never&amp;f=false page 160]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar idea is contained in the physician's adage, "[[zebra (medicine)|When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras]]."

'''''The Rational Optimist''''' is a 2010 [[popular science]] book by [[Matt Ridley]], author of ''[[The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature]]''. The book primarily focuses on the benefits of the innate human tendency to trade goods and services. Ridley argues that this trait, together with the specialization linked to it, is the source of modern human civilization, and that, as people increasingly specialize in their skill sets, we will have increased trade and more prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting better all the time|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16103826|date=13 May 2010|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bill Gates]] praised the book for critiquing opposition to international aid, but criticised the book for under-representing [[global catastrophic risk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Africa-Needs-Aid-Not-Flawed-Theories|title=The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves|author=Bill Gates|date=30 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ricardo Salinas Pliego]] praised the book as a defence of free trade and globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ricardo-b-salinas/the-rational-optimist_b_1872247.html|title='The Rational Optimist': Review|author=Ricardo B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11425">'''Woese's dogma''' is a principle of [[evolutionary biology]] first put forth by biophysicist [[Carl Woese]] in 1977. It states that the evolution of [[ribosomal RNA]] was a necessary precursor to the evolution of modern life forms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionary of Theories| year=2002| page=557| last=Bothamley| first=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advancement of the phylogenetic tree of life consisting of three domains rather than the previously accepted two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woese|first1=Carl R.|last2=Fox|first2=George E.|title=Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: The primary kingdoms|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1977|volume=74|issue=11|pages=5088–5090|bibcode=1977PNAS...74.5088W|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088|pmid=270744|pmc=432104}}&lt;/ref&gt;While the existence of [[Eukarya]] and [[Prokarya]] were already accepted, Woese was responsible for the distinction between [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koonin|first=Eugene V|date=2014-01-16|title=Carl Woese's vision of cellular evolution and the domains of life|journal=RNA Biology|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.4161/rna.27673|issn=1547-6286|pmc=4008548|pmid=24572480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial criticism and controversy surrounding his claims, Woese's three domain system, based on his work regarding the role of rRNA in the evolution of modern life, has become widely accepted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=1997-05-02|title=Microbial Biology: Microbiology's Scarred Revolutionary|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5313/699|journal=Science|language=en|volume=276|issue=5313|pages=699–702|doi=10.1126/science.276.5313.699|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9157549}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Homology as Evidence for Woese's Dogma ==

=== tRNA Homology ===
Evidence for Woese's dogma is well established through comparisons of RNA [[Homology (biology)|homology]]. Modern research allows more liberal use of [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]], allowing for a better comparative analysis between distant RNA. When analyzing multiple strains of [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], Root-Bernstein et. al. have compared [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]] encodings found within rRNA with tRNA found in ''E. coli'' to see if the secondary structure was the same as more “modern” tRNA present in ''E. coli''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Comparisons between the tRNA encodings found in the rRNAs and [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the control sequences found that “sortings” for these sequences were extremely similar, and comparisons of translated protein structure indicated that homology was likely&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=Meredith|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Robert|date=February 2015|title=The ribosome as a missing link in the evolution of life|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=367|pages=130–158|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, sequences homologous to all tRNAs necessary for translation were present in 16s and 23s rRNAs, and synthetases to load these tRNAs were also found, indicating that many of the functions of transcription and translation present in more modern life exist in rRNA, if vestigially&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.


=== rRNA Homology ===
When comparing homologies of rRNA structures, it is necessary to analyze substructures. This is because models that study RNA structure on the whole do not currently exist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caetano-Anolles|first=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Tracing the evolution of RNA structure in ribosomes|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/30/11/2575/1024880|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2575–2587|doi=10.1093/nar/30.11.2575|issn=1362-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Generally, [[Phylogenetics|phylogenies]] of rRNA subunits are created to understand each component, and how they function and evolve. Through phylogenies created that depict rRNA structural elements that are present in all three domains of life, the oldest structural components can be determined through [[relative dating]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harish|first=Ajith|last2=Caetano-Anollés|first2=Gustavo|date=2012-03-12|title=Ribosomal History Reveals Origins of Modern Protein Synthesis|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032776|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e32776|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032776|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3299690|pmid=22427882}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These phylogenies were used in a study by Harish et. al., to show that a helical stem labeled h44 in small subunit rRNA can be described as the oldest structural component of rRNA, which holds particular significance, as this structure responsible for linking processes in the small subunit, which is responsible for decoding, with the large subunit, which is responsible for the formation of peptide bonds and the releasing of elongation factors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This essentially shows that the functional origin of the ribosome, responsible for protein synthesis, is common in all modern life throughout each of the three domains.

Evidence has also been obtained in studying eukaryotic organelles, such as the chloroplast. Zablen et al.’s phylogenetic analysis conducted electrophoresis on chloroplast ribosomal RNA, specifically on the 16S rRNA of ''[[Euglena gracilis]]''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zablen|first=L. B.|last2=Kissil|first2=M. S.|last3=Woese|first3=C. R.|last4=Buetow|first4=D. E.|date=June 1975|title=Phylogenetic origin of the chloroplast and prokaryotic nature of its ribosomal RNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/806081|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=72|issue=6|pages=2418–2422|issn=0027-8424|pmid=806081}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In conducting this experiment, researchers compared the electrophoretic fingerprint of this RNA to other chloroplasts and prokarya. In comparing these results, it was found that generally, these chloroplasts show a close genomic relationship, while a more distant one is seen for algae, and subsequently prokaryotic organisms&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This experiment shows that the rRNA of distantly related organisms has a similar origin of that in eukaryotic organelles, supporting the idea that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor of modern life.

== Ribosomes as Primordial Self-Replicating Entities ==
One of the reasons that Woese’s Dogma holds significance is because of the potential that RNA was the first primordial self-replicating molecule (see: [[RNA world|RNA World]]), meaning it would be  key in the progression of modern life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloch|first=David P.|last2=McArthur|first2=Barbara|last3=Mirrop|first3=Sam|date=January 1985|title=tRNA-rRNA sequence homologies: Evidence for an ancient modular format shared by tRNAs and rRNAs|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0303264785900759|journal=Biosystems|volume=17|issue=3|pages=209–225|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(85)90075-9|issn=0303-2647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In particular, it has been proposed that ribosomes exist as a missing link in prebiotic evolution, with rRNA being a vestige of an ancient genome&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some evidence exists for the proposal that rRNA functioned in the past to encode proteins that are key to ribosome function&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=Robert|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Meredith|date=May 2016|title=The ribosome as a missing link in prebiotic evolution II: Ribosomes encode ribosomal proteins that bind to common regions of their own mRNAs and rRNAs|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.030|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=397|pages=115–127|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.030|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One notable example is the fact that rRNA proteins are commonly known to bind with their own mRNA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. In addition, some ribosomal proteins not only regulate their own expression, but the expression of other proteins as well&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matelska|first=Dorota|last2=Purta|first2=Elzbieta|last3=Panek|first3=Sylwia|last4=Boniecki|first4=Michal J.|last5=Bujnicki|first5=Janusz M.|last6=Dunin-Horkawicz|first6=Stanislaw|date=2013-10-01|title=S6:S18 ribosomal protein complex interacts with a structural motif present in its own mRNA|url=http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1341|journal=RNA|language=en|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1341–1348|doi=10.1261/rna.038794.113|issn=1355-8382|pmc=3854524|pmid=23980204}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are both indications of self-replication, and indicate the possibility that the mRNA that encodes ribosomal proteins evolved from rRNA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Criticisms Regarding Primordial rRNA ===
RNA existing as a primordial self replicating entity is an idea that faces criticism. The idea of rRNA in particular being sufficient on its own to explain the progression of modern life struggles due to the fact that it lacks certain key pieces of evidence. In particular RNA cannot be shown to be prebiotic, as there is no way for the nucleotides or nucleosides that compose it to be non-enzymatically replicated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kevin E.|last2=Levy|first2=Matthew|last3=Miller|first3=Stanley L.|date=2000-04-11|title=Peptide nucleic acids rather than RNA may have been the first genetic molecule|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/3868|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=97|issue=8|pages=3868–3871|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.3868|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10760258}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, other criticisms exist, such as the fact that RNA is not stable enough to have arisen prebiotically, and that it is too complex to have arisen prebiotically&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Harold S|date=2012|title=The RNA world hypothesis: the worst theory of the early evolution of life (except for all the others)a|url=https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-7-23|journal=Biology Direct|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-7-23|issn=1745-6150|pmc=3495036|pmid=22793875}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This has led to the development of other hypotheses, such as 'proteins first', which states that proteins arose prior to RNA, or coevolved with RNA&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This has also led to the proposal of other primordial molecules that may have developed into RNA and DNA, such as [[Peptide nucleic acid|peptide nucleic acids]], which also show evidence of self replication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Abhishek|last2=Bagnacani|first2=Valentina|last3=Corradini|first3=Roberto|last4=Nielsen|first4=Peter E.|date=2014-09-18|title=Toward Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Directed Peptide Translation Using Ester Based Aminoacyl Transfer|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cb5005349|journal=ACS Chemical Biology|language=EN|volume=9|issue=11|pages=2612–2620|doi=10.1021/cb5005349|issn=1554-8929}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite the fact that criticisms might exist on the primordial or prebiotic nature of rRNA, these criticisms are not aimed at Woese's Dogma on the whole, as Woese's Dogma only claims that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor to modern life, not that rRNA arose prebiotically.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==History==

Use of the phrase "working hypothesis" goes back at least two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;1805, for example. See  [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;q=%22working%20hypothesis%22 p. 118] in ''The Monthly Review; or Literary Journal'' vol. XLVII, May–August 1805, London: Printed by Straban and Preston (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPkAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover its title page] for year printed as "M,DCCC,V").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] came to hold that an explanatory hypothesis is not only justifiable as a [[Abductive reasoning|tentative conclusion]] by its plausibility (by which he meant its naturalness and economy of explanation),&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, pp. 90–112. See both part III and part IV. Reprinted, including originally unpublished portion, in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 6, paragraphs 452–85, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 434–50, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; but also justifiable as a starting point by the broader promise that the hypothesis holds for research. This idea of justifying a hypothesis as potentially fruitful (at the level of research method), not merely as plausible (at the level of logical conclusions), is essential for the idea of a working hypothesis, as later elaborated by Peirce's fellow [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Dewey]].

Peirce held that, as a matter of research method, an explanatory hypothesis is judged and selected&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., Carnegie Application (L75, 1902, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, pp. 37–38. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'': {{quote|Methodeutic has a special interest in Abduction, or the inference which starts a scientific hypothesis. For it is not sufficient that a hypothesis should be a justifiable one. Any hypothesis which explains the facts is justified critically. But among justifiable hypotheses we have to select that one which is suitable for being tested , experiment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for research because it offers to economize and expedite the process of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), application to the Carnegie Institution, see MS L75.329-330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by being testable and by further factors in the economy of hypotheses: low cost, intrinsic value (instinctive naturalness and reasoned likelihood), and relations (caution, breadth, and incomplexity) among hypotheses, inquiries, etc. (as in the game of [[Twenty Questions]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S.

S. ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 7, paragraph 534, from an undated manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; For Peirce the pragmatist, conceiving pragmatically of something meant conceiving of its effects in their conceivable implications as to informed practice in general including research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.

[[John Dewey]] used the concept of the working hypothesis as a pivotal feature in his theory of [[inquiry]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management.

Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the principles of verification and falsifiability, used in formal hypothesis testing found within dominant paradigms of 'normal' science,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; working hypotheses were conceived by Dewey as neither true nor false but "provisional, working means of advancing investigation," which lead to the discovery of other unforeseen but "relevant" facts.&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt; Dewey's development of the concept of the working hypothesis emerged from his [[contextualism|contextualist]] [[epistemology]] in which absolute truth is unobtainable and replaced by "warranted assertability".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of science also shows that when hypotheses have been taken to be finally ''true'' and hence unquestionable, they have obstructed inquiry and kept science committed to doctrines that later turned out to be invalid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Dewey's view, the working hypothesis is generated, not directly as a testable statement of, but instead in order to "direct inquiry into channels in which new material, factual and conceptual, is disclosed, material which is more relevant, more weighted and confirmed, more fruitful, than were the initial facts and conceptions which served as the point of departure".&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt;

[[Abraham Kaplan]] later described the working hypothesis as "provisional or loosely formatted" theory or [[construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]].&lt;ref&gt;

Working hypotheses are constructed to facilitate inquiry; however, formal hypotheses can often be constructed based on the results of the inquiry, which in turn allows for the design of specific experiments whose data will either support or fail to support the formal hypotheses. In ''Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis'' Oppenheim and Putnam argued that unitary science, in which laws from one branch could be equally useful by others, could only be accepted tentatively without further empirical testing. Thus they argued:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=Paul Oppenheim, Hilary Putnam
 |year=1958
 |title=Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis
 |url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/Phil951/2010/openheim.putnam.unity.pdf
 |journal=[[Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science]]
 |volume=2 |pages=3–36
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We therefore think the assumption that unitary science can be attained through cumulative micro-reduction recommends itself as a working hypothesis. That is, we believe that it is in accord with the standards of reasonable scientific judgment to tentatively accept this hypothesis and to work on the assumption that further progress can be made in this direction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Putnam, the working hypothesis, therefore, represents a practical starting point in the design of an empirical research exploration.  A contrasting example of this conception of the working hypothesis is illustrated by the [[brain in a vat|brain-in-a-vat]] thought experiment. This experiment involves confronting the global skeptic position that we, in fact, are all just brains in vats being stimulated by a mad scientist to believe that our reality is real. Putnam argued that this proposition, however, rests on a "magical theory of reference" in which the existential evidence necessary to validate it is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the brain-in-a-vat proposition does not make for much of a hypothesis at all since there is no means to verify its truth. It does, however, provide a contrast for what a good working hypothesis would look like: one suited to culling potential existential evidence of the subject at hand.

A more concrete example would be that of [[conjecture]]s in [[mathematics]] – propositions which appear to be true but which are formally unproven. Very often, conjectures will be provisionally accepted as working hypotheses in order to [[Conjecture#Use of conjectures in conditional proofs|investigate its consequences]] and formulate [[conditional proof]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Application==
In the field of [[public administration]] working hypotheses are used as a [[conceptual framework]] for exploratory, applied, empirical research &lt;ref&gt;Baum, Kevin,2003. “Understanding the Line – Staff Relationship in Fire Service.” in ''Handbook of Conflict Management.’’ Edited by William Pammer and Jerri Killian. New York: Marcel Dekker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M., 1998.

Vol. 9, No. 1: 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Research projects that use working hypotheses use a [[deductive reasoning]] or logic of [[inquiry]]. In other words, the problem and preliminary theory are developed ahead of time and tested using evidence.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Working hypotheses (statements of expectation) are flexible and incorporate relational or non-relational statements. They are often used as ways to investigate a problem in a particular city or public agency.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, James T. 2010.

These projects are a type of case study and use multiple methods of evidence collection.&lt;ref&gt;Yin, Robert. 2007. ''Case Study Research: Design and Methods’’. 4th edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; The working hypotheses are used as a device to direct evidence collection. As a result, working hypotheses are generally organized using sub-hypotheses, which specify in more detail the kinds of data or evidence needed to support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;
