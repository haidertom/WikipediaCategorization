      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">'''Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena''' ([[Asset (disambiguation)|ASSET]]) is an [[organization]] at [[Cornell University]] that is dedicated to expanding the use of the protist ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' in K-12 classrooms.  They are funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program.  Although their name includes the word "secondary," they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools.  The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher.

==Modules==

Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life [[science]] curriculum.  The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the [[teacher]] in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container.  Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the [[culture]] to be established in the teacher's classroom.

===Science Modules===

ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in [[United States]] school curricula.

====Cannibalism and Interspecefic Predation====

This module utilizes two species of ''[[Tetrahymena]]'':  ''Tetrahymena thermophilia'' and ''Tetrahymena vorax''.   In the lab, an extract, called [[stomatin]], is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture.  There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax.  This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus.  This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species.&lt;ref name="vorax paper"&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/14/2089.long] In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Society Modules===

ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit.

===Elementary School Modules===

&lt;br /&gt;a) Misinterpreted [[Regression to the mean|natural course]] – the individual gets better without treatment.
&lt;br /&gt;b) [[Placebo|Placebo effect]] or false treatment effect – an individual receives "alternative therapy" and is convinced it will help. The conviction makes them more likely to get better.
&lt;br /&gt;c) [[Nocebo]] effect – an individual is convinced that standard treatment will not work, and that alternative treatment will work. This decreases the likelihood standard treatment will work, while the placebo effect of the "alternative" remains. 
&lt;br /&gt;d) No adverse effects — Standard treatment is replaced with "alternative" treatment, getting rid of adverse effects, but also of improvement.
&lt;br /&gt; e) Interference — Standard treatment is "complemented" with something that interferes with its effect. This can both cause worse effect, but also decreased (or even increased) side effects, which may be interpreted as "helping".
&lt;br /&gt;Researchers such as [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[clinical statistician]]s and [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]]s use [[clinical trial]]s to tease out such effects, allowing doctors to offer only that which has been shown to work. "Alternative treatments" often refuse to use trials or make it deliberately hard to do so.

'''Alternative medicine''', '''fringe medicine''', '''pseudomedicine''' or simply '''questionable medicine''' is the use and promotion of practices which are unproven, disproven, impossible to prove, or excessively harmful in relation to their effect — in the attempt to achieve the [[healing]] effects of [[medicine]].&lt;!--{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}}{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n|}}{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n}}--&gt;&lt;!--{{refn|group=n|According to the Tzu Chi Institute, a Canadian centre established to evaluate complementary and alternative therapies, "alternative therapies are those lacking scientific validation that are excluded from medical school training programs and uninsured by health plans."&lt;ref name=IGPIAMAYP/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSF_2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Angell1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1019807158|title=More harm than good? : the moral maze of complementary and alternative medicine|last=(Edzard)|first=Ernst, E.|publisher=|others=Smith, Kevin|year=|isbn=9783319699417|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=18|oclc=1019807158}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; They differ from [[experimental medicine]] in that the latter employs [[Clinical trial|responsible investigation]], and accepts results that show it to be ineffective.&lt;!--Consumer health, page 133 --&gt; The [[scientific consensus]] is that alternative therapies either do not, or cannot, work.

Alternative medicine is used by a significant number of people, though its popularity is often overstated.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;--&gt; Large amounts of funding go to testing alternative medicine, with more than US$2.5 [[billion]] spent by the United States government alone.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31190909/ |title=$2.5 billion spent, no alternative cures found|date=2009-06-10|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Almost none show any effect beyond that of [[Placebo|false treatment]],&lt;!--&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdulla1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdulla|first1=Sara|title=Phytotherapy – good science or big business?|journal=Nature|date=May 13, 1999|doi=10.1038/news990513-8|quote=Science-based medicine, with its emphasis on controlled study, proof, evidence, statistical significance and safety is being rejected in favour of 'alternative medicine'&amp;nbsp;– an atavistic portmanteau of anecdote, hearsay, rumour and hokum....

This fact is often overlooked by media or intentionally kept hidden, with alternative practice being portrayed positively when compared to [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|"big pharma"]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt; --&gt; The lobby has successfully pushed for alternative therapies to be subject to far less regulation than conventional medicine.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt;--&gt; Alternative therapies may even be allowed to promote use when there is demonstrably no effect, only a tradition of use. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine and [[health care provider]]s varies between and within countries. Despite laws making it illegal to market or promote alternative therapies for use in cancer treatment, many practitioners promote them.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/|title=Complementary and alternative therapies – Cancer in general |publisher= Cancer Research UK|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/ServiceA-Z/INTMED/IMCAN/Pages/Home.aspx|title=Complementary cancer care service|website=www.uclh.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Alternative medicine is criticized for taking advantage of the weakest members of society.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;--&gt;

== Definitions and terminology ==

=== Alternative medicine ===
'''Alternative medicine''' is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of [[medicine]],{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n|"[A]lternative medicine refers to all treatments that have not been proven effective using scientific methods."&lt;ref name=NSF_2002/&gt;}}{{refn|"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed."{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=19}}|name=IOMquote|group=n}} but whose [[efficacy|effectiveness]] has not been clearly established using [[scientific method]]s,{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n}}{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n|"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine&amp;nbsp;– conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work... speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence."&lt;ref name=Angell1998/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGPIAMAYP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NP" /&gt; or whose theory and practice is not part of [[biomedicine]],{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}{{refn|group=n|name=Harrisonquote |"The phrase complementary and alternative medicine is used to describe a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that have historic origins outside mainstream medicine. Most of these practices are used together with conventional therapies and therefore have been called complementary to distinguish them from alternative practices, those used as a substitute for standard care. ... Until a decade ago or so, "complementary and alternative medicine" could be defined as practices that are neither taught in medical schools nor reimbursed, but this definition is no longer workable, since medical students increasingly seek and receive some instruction about complementary health practices, and some practices are reimbursed by third-party payers. Another definition, practices that lack an evidence base, is also not useful, since there is a growing body of research on some of these modalities, and some aspects of standard care do not have a strong evidence base."{{sfn|Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|2015|loc=chpt. 14-E|p=1}}}}{{refn |name=WebMD2014quote |group=n |"An alternative medical system is a set of practices based on a philosophy different from Western biomedicine."&lt;ref name=WebMD2014/&gt;}}{{refn |group=n |name=NCCIH2quote |"CAM is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine."&lt;ref name=NCCIH2/&gt;}} or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by [[scientific evidence]] or [[science|scientific principles]] used in biomedicine.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCER" /&gt; "Biomedicine" or "medicine" is that part of [[medical science]] that applies principles of [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biophysics]], and other [[natural science]]s to [[clinical practice]], using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice. Unlike medicine,{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}} an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods, but may instead be based on [[testimonial|hearsay]], [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], [[propaganda]], [[fraud]], or other unscientific sources.{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n}}&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;

In ''General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine'', published in 2000 by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), complementary and alternative medicine were defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.&lt;ref name="WHO_Trad_Med_Defs" /&gt;{{sfn|WHO|2000}}

The expression also refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products, practices, and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence, to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence, and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful.{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DaguptaHStabler2011" /&gt;

The terms ''alternative medicine'', ''complementary medicine'', ''integrative medicine,'' ''holistic medicine'', ''natural medicine'', ''unorthodox medicine'', ''fringe medicine'', ''unconventional medicine'', and ''[[new age]] medicine'' are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1|title=Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All|last=Shapiro|first=Rose|date=2010-09-30|publisher=Random House |isbn=9781409059165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bombardieri2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shuval2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2011" /&gt;

The meaning of the term "alternative" in the expression "alternative medicine", is not that it is an effective alternative to [[medical science]], although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=On Fringes of Health Care, Untested Therapies Thrive|date=June 17, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/17/us/on-fringes-of-health-care-untested-therapies-thrive.html?pagewanted=all|author-link=Gina Kolata|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions "western medicine" and "eastern medicine" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between [[evidence-based medicine]] and treatments that do not work.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;

=== Complementary or integrative medicine {{anchor|Complementary medicine|Integrative medicine|Integrated medicine}} ===
'''Complementary medicine''' ('''CM''') or '''integrative medicine''' ('''IM''') is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment, in a [[belief]] that it improves the effect of treatments.{{refn|group=n|name=FinalReport|The ''Final Report'' (2002) of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy states: "The Commissioners believe and have repeatedly stated in this Report that our response should be to hold all systems of health and healing, including conventional and CAM, to the same rigorous standards of good science and health services research.

==="Allopathic medicine"===
{{main|Allopathic medicine}}
''Allopathic medicine'' or ''allopathy'' is an expression commonly used by [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]] and proponents of other forms of alternative medicine to refer to [[medicine|mainstream medicine]]. It was used to describe the traditional European practice of [[heroic medicine]],&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758098687|title=Consumer health : a guide to intelligent decisions|last1=Barrett|first1=Stephen|last2=London|first2=William M.|last3=Kroger|first3=Manfred|last4=Hall|first4=Harriet|last5=Baratz|first5=Robert S.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|isbn=9780078028489|edition=9th|location=New York|pages=34–35, 134, 137|oclc=758098687}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later continued to be used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

Allopathy refers to the use of pharmacologically active [[Active ingredient|agents]] or [[Surgery|physical interventions]] to treat or suppress [[symptoms]] or [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] processes of diseases or conditions.&lt;ref name="FREEDICT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/allopathy |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |title=Definition {{ndash}} allopathy |accessdate=25 October 2013}} Citing: ''Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine'' (2008) and ''Mosby's Medical Dictionary'', 8th ed. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The German version of the word, {{em|allopathisch}}, was coined in 1810 by the creator of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]] (1755–1843).&lt;ref name="Whorton2003" /&gt; The word was coined from {{em|allo-}} (different) and {{em|-pathic}} (relating to a disease or to a method of treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|allopathic|id=5407}}&lt;/ref&gt; In alternative medicine circles the expression "allopathic medicine" is still used to refer to "the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, [[biomedicine]], [[evidence-based medicine]], or modern medicine" (see the article on [[scientific medicine]]).&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review |accessdate=2007-09-12 |year=2001|author=Xiaorui Zhang|publisher=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926083307/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |archivedate= 26 September 2007 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAM===
CAM is an abbreviation of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="ernstinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CassilethDeng2004" /&gt; It has also been called sCAM or SCAM with the addition of "so-called" or "supplements".&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyreman 209–17"/&gt; The words balance and holism are often used, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense [[rebranding]] of what are essentially the same practices: as soon as one name is declared synonymous with [[quackery]], a new name is chosen.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08" /&gt;

===Traditional medicine===
{{main|Traditional medicine}}
'''Traditional medicine''' refers to the pre-scientific practices of a certain culture, contrary to what is typically practiced in other cultures where medical science dominates.

"[[Eastern medicine]]" typically refers to the traditional medicines of Asia where conventional bio-medicine penetrated much later.

=== Holistic medicine ===

The words ''balance'' and ''holism'' are often used alongside ''complementary'' or ''integrative'' medicine, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense [[rebranding]] of what are essentially the same practices.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08" /&gt;

=== Problems with definition ===

Prominent members of the science&lt;ref name="Offit2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003a" /&gt; and biomedical science community&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt; say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine, that the expressions "conventional medicine", "alternative medicine", "complementary medicine", "integrative medicine",  and "holistic medicine" do not refer to any medicine at all.&lt;ref name="Offit2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontanarosa1998" /&gt;

Others in both the biomedical and CAM communities say that CAM ''cannot'' be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between CAM and biomedicine overlap, are porous, and change.{{sfn|Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|2015|loc=chpt. 14-E|p=1}}{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=14–20}} The expression "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) resists easy definition because the health systems and practices it refers to are diffuse, and its boundaries poorly defined.&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg" /&gt;{{sfn|Ruggie|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ViDwi7s2VvMC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}{{refn|group=n|Mary Ruggie in Chapter 2 of ''Marginal to Mainstream: Alternative Medicine in America'' said, "By the mid-1990s, the notion that some alternative therapies could be complementary to conventional medicine began to change the status of...alternative medicine. The 21st century is witnessing yet another terminological innovation, in which CAM and conventional medicine are becoming integrative."{{sfn|Ruggie|2004}}}} Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic technique]], [[therapy|therapeutic practice]] and in their relationship to the medical mainstream.{{sfn|Sointu|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2UUP36bjAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}} Some alternative therapies, including [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)]] and [[Ayurveda]], have antique origins in East or South Asia and are entirely alternative medical systems;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sointu|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2UUP36bjAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}. {{harvnb |IOM Report |2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=18 18]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others, such as homeopathy and chiropractic, have origins in Europe or the United States and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.{{sfn |Gevitz |1997 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIqk31BXpksC&amp;pg=PA603 603–33]}} Some, such as [[osteopathy]] and chiropractic, employ manipulative physical methods of treatment; others, such as [[meditation]] and [[prayer]], are based on [[mind-body intervention]]s.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=18 18]}} Treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another.&lt;ref name="Nissen2013" /&gt; Thus, chiropractic is not considered alternative in Denmark and likewise [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]] is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the United States.&lt;ref name="Nissen2013" /&gt;

Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that ''complementary'' is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skep_Dic_comp_med" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Novella2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

===Different types of definitions===
One common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as "other than" conventional medicine.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=14 14]}} For example, the widely referenced{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=19 19]}} descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)]] of the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]], states that it is "a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine".&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; For conventional medical practitioners, it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative.{{refn|group=n|As David J. Hufford, Professor and Director at the Doctors Kienle Center for Humanistic Medicine at the [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center|Penn State College of Medicine]],&lt;ref name=HuffordUPenn/&gt; has argued: "Simply because an herbal remedy comes to be used by physicians does not mean that herbalists cease to practice, or that the practice of the one becomes like that of the other."&lt;ref name=Hufford2004a/&gt;}}

Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare.&lt;ref name="Saks1992" /&gt; This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to [[Medical research#Funding|research funding]], sympathetic coverage in the [[Medical literature|medical press]], or inclusion in the standard [[Medical education|medical curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Saks1992" /&gt; In 1993, the [[British Medical Association|British Medical Association (BMA)]], one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine, stated that it{{refn|group=n|The BMA used the term non-conventional medicine instead of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=BMA_1993_1st/&gt;}} referred to "...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions, and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses".&lt;ref name="BMA_1993_1st" /&gt; In a US context, an influential definition coined in 1993 by the Harvard-based physician,&lt;ref name="Artus2007" /&gt; David M. Eisenberg,&lt;ref name="Eisenberg_Bio" /&gt; characterized alternative medicine "as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenberg et al.|1993}}. {{harvnb|Eisenberg et al.|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and CAM introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training;&lt;ref name="HOL_Kopelman_Wieland_Astin_Pelletier" /&gt; alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of [[Medical school in the United States|US medical schools]] and increasingly [[Health insurance in the United States|US health insurers]] are willing to provide reimbursement for CAM therapies.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=196 196–252]}} In 1999, 7.7% of US hospitals reported using some form of CAM therapy; this proportion had risen to 37.7% by 2008.&lt;ref name="Salomonsen_AHA" /&gt;

An expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the US Office for Alternative Medicine (OAM),&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|The Office for Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, was renamed NCCAM in 1998.&lt;ref name=FDA_regulatory/&gt;}} devised a [[theoretical definition]]&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt; of alternative medicine as "a broad domain of healing resources&amp;nbsp;... other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period".&lt;ref name="CAM_RMC1997" /&gt; This definition has been widely adopted by CAM researchers,&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt; cited by official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health,&lt;ref name="UKDoH_CAM" /&gt; attributed as the definition used by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]],&lt;ref name="ZollChanCoulRobeAdamArtu" /&gt; and, with some modification,{{dubious|date=June 2015}} was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the [[Institute of Medicine|US Institute of Medicine]], ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States''.{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}

The 1995 OAM conference definition, an expansion of Eisenberg's 1993 formulation, is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="Hufford2004" /&gt; Its proponents hold that it thus avoids [[relativism]] about differing forms of medical knowledge and, while it is an essentially political definition, this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream [[biomedicine]] is solely due to political forces.&lt;ref name="Hufford2004" /&gt; According to this definition, alternative and [[medicine|mainstream medicine]] can only be differentiated with reference to what is "intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture".&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt; However, there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and [[subculture]]s, nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate, nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity.&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt; If the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs, the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population.&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt;

[[Normative]] definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated, or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17]}} These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of [[evidence-based medicine]], they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but are not based on [[evidence]] gathered with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCI_PDQ_CAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Borkan2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2005" /&gt; Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by [[Marcia Angell]], a former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine&amp;nbsp;– conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This line of division has been subject to criticism, however, as not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit,{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}}&lt;ref name="Ezzo2001" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=17–18}} and it is also unlikely in most instances that conventional therapies, if proven to be ineffective, would ever be classified as CAM.&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;

Similarly, the public information website maintained by the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of Australia uses the acronym "CAM" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements.&lt;ref name="NHMRC_CAM" /&gt;

The [[National Board of Health (Denmark)|Danish National Board of Health's]] "Council for Alternative Medicine" (Sundhedsstyrelsens Råd for Alternativ Behandling (SRAB)), an independent institution under the National Board of Health (Danish: ''Sundhedsstyrelsen''), uses the term "alternative medicine" for:
* Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals.

Alternative medicine consists of a wide range of health care practices, products, and therapies. The shared feature is a claim to heal that is not based on the scientific method. Alternative medicine practices are diverse in their foundations and methodologies.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Alternative medicine practices may be classified by their cultural origins or by the types of beliefs upon which they are based.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCER" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Methods may incorporate or be based on traditional medicinal practices of a particular culture, folk knowledge, superstition,{{sfn|O'Connor|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JXFPb88KLZQC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}} spiritual beliefs, belief in [[supernatural]] energies ([[antiscience]]), [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, fraud, new or different concepts of health and disease, and any bases other than being proven by scientific methods.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCER" /&gt; Different cultures may have their own unique traditional or belief based practices developed recently or over thousands of years, and specific practices or entire systems of practices.

Alternative medical systems may be based on [[traditional medicine]] practices, such as [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM), [[Ayurveda]] in India, or practices of other cultures around the world.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Some useful applications of traditional medicines have been researched and accepted within ordinary medicine, however the underlying belief systems are seldom scientific and are not accepted.

Traditional medicine is considered alternative when it is used outside its home region; or when it is used together with or instead of known functional treatment; or when it can be reasonably expected that the patient or practitioner knows or should know that it will not work – such as knowing that the practice is based on superstition.

Since ancient times, in many parts of the world a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Among these are: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=1997|isbn=9780674270244 |oclc=36126503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47, 62–63, 154–55, 230–31}} Historian of science [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has written of the probable [[Protoscience|protoscientific]] origins of this folk knowledge in observation of farm animals.  Women who knew that grazing on certain plants would cause an animal to abort (with negative economic consequences for the farm) would be likely to try out those plants on themselves in order to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ahk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Koblitz | first=Ann Hibner | title=Sex and Herbs and Birth Control: Women and Fertility Regulation Through the Ages | publisher=Kovalevskaia Fund | year=2014 | isbn=9780989665506}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

However, modern users of these plants often lack knowledge of the proper preparation and dosage.  The historian of medicine [[John M. Riddle|John Riddle]] has spoken of the "broken chain of knowledge" caused by urbanization and modernization,&lt;ref name="riddle2" /&gt;{{rp|167–205}} and Koblitz has written that "folk knowledge about effective contraception techniques often disappears over time or becomes inextricably mixed with useless or harmful practices."&lt;ref name="ahk" /&gt;{{rp|vii}}  The ill-informed or indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious and even lethal side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Sullivan | first1=John B. | last2=et al. | title=Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatoxicity | journal=Journal of the American Medical Association | year=1979|volume=242|issue=26|pages=2873–74|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235–39 |year=2003 |pmid=12807304 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120021104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Traditional practices and beliefs from China, together with modifications made by the Communist party make up TCM. Common practices include herbal medicine, [[acupuncture]] (insertion of needles in the body at specified points), massage (Tui na), exercise ([[qigong]]), and dietary therapy.
|The practices are based on belief in a supernatural energy called [[qi]], considerations of [[Chinese astrology|Chinese Astrology]] and [[Numerology#Chinese numerology|Chinese numerology]], traditional use of herbs and other substances found in China&amp;nbsp;– a belief that the tongue contains a map of the body that reflects changes in the body, and an incorrect model of the anatomy and physiology of internal organs.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyersteinSampson1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LuNeedham1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maciocia1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matuk2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deshpande1987" /&gt;

|[[Ayurveda]]
|Traditional medicine of India. Ayurveda believes in the existence of three elemental substances, the [[Ayurveda#Tridosha system|doshas]] (called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. Such disease-inducing imbalances can be adjusted and balanced using traditional herbs, minerals and heavy metals. Ayurveda stresses the use of plant-based medicines and treatments, with some animal products, and added minerals, including [[sulfur]], [[arsenic]], [[lead]] and [[copper sulfate]]{{Clarify|date=October 2017}}.
|Safety concerns have been raised about Ayurveda, with two U.S. studies finding about 20 percent of Ayurvedic Indian-manufactured [[patent medicine]]s contained toxic levels of heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]]. A 2015 study of users in the United States also found elevated blood lead levels in 40 percent of those tested.  Other concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities. Incidents of [[heavy metal poisoning]] have been attributed to the use of these compounds in the United States.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Mishra|2004|p=8}}&lt;ref name="DaguptaHStabler2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiathan2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saper2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet|title=Ayurveda: Ancient Superstition, Not Ancient Wisdom|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/ayurveda_ancient_superstition_not_ancient_wisdom|website=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breeher L, Mikulski MA, Czeczok T, Leinenkugel K, Fuortes LJ|title=A cluster of lead poisoning among consumers of Ayurvedic medicine|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|date=6 Apr 2015|volume=4|issue=4|pages=303–07|doi=10.1179/2049396715Y.0000000009|pmid=25843124|pmc=4727589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCCIH classification ===
A US agency, National Center on Complementary and Integrative Health ([[NCCIH]]), has created a classification system for branches of complementary and alternative medicine that divides them into five major groups. These groups have some overlap, and distinguish  two types of [[energy]] medicine: ''veritable'' which involves scientifically observable energy (including [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]] and [[light therapy]]) and ''putative'', which invokes physically undetectable or unverifiable energy.&lt;ref name="NCCIH_EMed" /&gt; None of these energies have any evidence to support that they effect the body in any positive or health promoting way.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

# Whole medical systems: Cut across more than one of the other groups; examples include traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, and ayurveda.
# Mind-body interventions: Explore the interconnection between the mind, body, and spirit, under the premise that they affect "bodily functions and symptoms". A connection between mind and body is conventional medical fact, and this classification does not include therapies with proven function such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].
# "Biology"-based practices: Use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances. (Note that as used here, "biology" does ''not'' refer to the science of [[biology]], but is a usage newly coined by NCCIH in the primary source used for this article. "Biology-based" as coined by NCCIH may refer to chemicals from a nonbiological source, such as use of the poison [[lead]] in traditional Chinese medicine, and to other nonbiological substances.)
# Manipulative and body-based practices: feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in bodywork, chiropractic, and osteopathic manipulation.
# Energy medicine: is a domain that deals with putative and verifiable energy fields:
#* [[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that are purported to surround and penetrate the body. The existence of such energy fields have been disproven.
#* [[Bioelectromagnetism|Bioelectromagnetic]]-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in an non-scientific manner.

Flexner argued that mastery of the scientific method of problem solving was the key for physicians to manage medical uncertainty and to practice in the most cost-effective way."&lt;ref name=Ludmerer2010/&gt;}} Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology.&lt;ref name="Bianco" /&gt; Medical schools' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine,&lt;ref name="Stanford_Curriculum" /&gt; and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making).&lt;ref name="Yale_Curriculum" /&gt; Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center, in which education, research, and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the [[pathophysiological]] basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms, and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.&lt;ref name="Snyderman2002" /&gt;

By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US.&lt;ref name="Berman2001" /&gt; Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration).&lt;ref name="UM_CAM_Field" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UM_CIM" /&gt; Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed [[physicians in the United States|physicians in the US]] who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD).&lt;ref name="Medline_MD" /&gt; All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)]].&lt;ref name="Medline_MD" /&gt;

== Efficacy ==
There is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite [[scientific validation]], and their [[efficacy|effectiveness]] is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldrosen2004" /&gt; Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005}} [[Publication bias|Selective publication bias]], marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="Sarris2012" /&gt;

''The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine'' points to confusions in the general population&amp;nbsp;– a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.&lt;ref name="Alcock1999" /&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative&lt;ref name="goodbadugly" /&gt; and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on "sound evidence", although he believes that may be an overestimate.&lt;ref name="Ernst2011" /&gt; Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are "statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments", but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.&lt;ref name="Economist2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HHH2008" /&gt;

In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref name="Katz2003" /&gt; According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.

{{as of|2005}}, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=135 135–36]}}

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.&lt;ref name="Bodeker2002" /&gt;

Cancer researcher [[Andrew J. Vickers]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many [[alternative cancer treatments]] have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. The label "unproven" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been "disproven".&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Placebo effect ===
A research methods expert and author of ''Snake Oil Science'', [[R. Barker Bausell]], has stated that "it's become politically correct to investigate nonsense."&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt; There are concerns that just having NIH support is being used to give unfounded "legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt;

Use of placebos to achieve a [[placebo effect]] in integrative medicine has been criticized as, "...diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology."&lt;ref name="Novella2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

Another critic has argued that academic proponents of [[integrative medicine]] sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments to achieve a placebo effect.{{refn|group=n|As a 2010 article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' concluded: &lt;blockquote&gt;real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments. There was, nevertheless, evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment, and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.&lt;ref name="Berman2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} However, a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56% of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well. Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits.&lt;ref name="Kerman2010" /&gt;

[[Integrative medicine]] has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science-based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending [[placebo]]s are not. "[[Quackery#Criticism of quackery in academia|quackademic medicine]]" is a pejorative term used for ''[[integrative medicine]]'', which medical professionals consider an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase, changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals.&lt;ref name="Winnick2005_2009" /&gt; Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (later [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], currently [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]).{{refn|group=n|According to the medical historian [[James Harvey Young]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1991 the Senate Appropriations Committee responsible for funding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared itself "not satisfied that the conventional medical community as symbolized at the NIH has fully explored the potential that exists in unconventional medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Young |first1= J.H. |title= The Development of the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health, 1991–1996 |doi= 10.1353/bhm.1998.0110 |journal= Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 279–98 |year= 1998 |pmid=  9628052 |pmc= |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} In the "condemnation" phase, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, authors had ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM; in the "reassessment" phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), when increased consumer utilization of CAM was prompting concern, authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend; in the "integration" phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Use and regulation==

===Appeal===
[[File:"Miracle Cure!" Health Fraud Scams (8528312890).jpg|thumb|Alternative therapies often make bombastic claims, and frequently include anecdotes from healthy-looking individuals claiming successful treatment.]]

Practitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.&lt;ref name="Sobel2000"/&gt;

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the placebo effect&amp;nbsp;– a well-established observation in medicine.&lt;ref name="van_Deventer2008"/&gt;  Related to it are similar psychological effects, such as the will to believe,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt;

====Marketing====
[[File:Edzard ernst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edzard Ernst]], a leading authority on scientific study of alternative treatments and diagnoses, and the first university professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Here in 2012, promoting his book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' co-written with [[Simon Singh]].]]

The popularity of complementary &amp; alternative medicine (CAM) may be related to other factors that [[Edzard Ernst]] mentioned in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. "People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. "At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.&lt;ref name="Con?"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Offit]] proposed that "alternative medicine becomes quackery" in four ways: by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful, promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning, draining patients' bank accounts, or by promoting "magical thinking."&lt;ref name=Offit2013/&gt;

[[File:Lemon-906141.jpg|thumb|Friendly and colorful images of herbal treatments may look less threatening or dangerous when compared to conventional medicine. This is an intentional marketing strategy.]]

====Social factors====

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine. There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt; Related to this are vigorous [[marketing]]&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt; of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt; Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt;

Patients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;

===Prevalence of use===

'''Complementary and alternative medicine''' (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2013}}

According to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Hélène|last2=Debons|first2=Jérôme|title=CAM and conventional medicine in Switzerland : divided in theory, united in practice. In N. K. Gale &amp; J. V. McHale, Routledge Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Perspectives from social science and law|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=271–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developing country|developing nations]], access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and [[poverty]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional remedies]], often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.&lt;ref name="WHO_tradmed_fact" /&gt;

Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.&lt;ref name="Horrobin1986" /&gt; However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCIH and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than US$2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nccih_$" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atwood2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Stated goals and grants of the Office of Alternative Medicine/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|url=|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|volume=5|issue=4|pages=205–07|author=Green S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That alternative medicine has been on the rise "in countries where Western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare, and 'evidence-based' practice is the dominant paradigm" was described as an "enigma" in the Medical Journal of Australia.&lt;ref name="Coulter2004" /&gt;

====In the US====

In the United States, the 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required that for states to receive federal money, they had to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse|abuse]] laws regarding religion-based healing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merrick |first=Janna | date=June 2003 |title=Spiritual Healing, Sick Kids and the Law: Inequities in the American Healthcare System |journal=American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=269–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=Child Welfare Information Gateway |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of alternative medicine in the US has increased,&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=D.M.|last2=Davis|first2=R.B.|last3=Ettner|first3=S.L.|last4=Appel|first4=S.|last5=Wilkey|first5=S.|last6=Van Rompay|first6=M.|last7=Kessler|first7=R.C.|displayauthors=1|year=1998|title=Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: Results of a follow-up national survey|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=188148|journal=JAMA|volume=280|issue=18|pages=1569–75|doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569|pmid=9820257|ref={{harvid|Eisenberg et al.|1998}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 50 percent increase in expenditures and a 25 percent increase in the use of alternative therapies between 1990 and 1997 in America.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg1998" /&gt; Americans spend many billions on the therapies annually.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg1998" /&gt; Most Americans used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain.&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; In America, women were more likely than men to use CAM, with the biggest difference in use of [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Mind-body interventions|mind-body therapies]] including prayer specifically for health reasons".&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; In 2008, more than 37% of American hospitals offered alternative therapies, up from 27 percent in 2005, and 25% in 2004.&lt;ref name="Warner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AHA2008" /&gt; More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.&lt;ref name="AHA2008" /&gt;

A survey of Americans found that 88 percent thought that "there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize".&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; Use of magnets was the most common tool in [[energy medicine]] in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least "sort of [[scientific method|scientific]]", when it is not at all scientific.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; "[[Therapeutic touch]]" was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nine-year-old child for a school science project.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa" /&gt;

====Prevalence of use of specific therapies====

The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45%), [[herbalism]] (19%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing meditation]] (12%), [[meditation (alternative medicine)|meditation]] (8%), [[chiropractic medicine]] (8%), [[yoga (alternative medicine)|yoga]] (5–6%), [[body work (alternative medicine)|body work]] (5%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Diet-based therapy|diet-based therapy]] (4%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Progressive Relaxation|progressive relaxation]] (3%), [[Orthomolecular medicine|mega-vitamin therapy]] (3%) and [[Visualization (cam)|Visualization]] (2%)&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes2008" /&gt;

In Britain, the most often used alternative therapies were [[Alexander technique]], [[Aromatherapy]], Bach and other flower remedies, Body work therapies including massage, Counseling stress therapies, [[hypnotherapy]], [[Meditation]], [[Reflexology]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], Nutritional medicine, and [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Sir Walton: Science and Technology Committee|2000}} Ayurvedic medicine remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003}} Safety concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.&lt;ref name="Valiathan2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saper2008" /&gt;

According to the [[National Health Service (England)]], the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.&lt;ref name="NHS_Careers_CAM" /&gt;

====In palliative care====

Complementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. "From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable."&lt;ref name="Kellhear2003" /&gt; The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ [[mind-body intervention|mind-body]] interventions designed to "reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life."&lt;ref name="Menefee2005" /&gt;

=== Regulation ===
{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}[[File:Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products (FDA October 16, 2008).djvu|thumb|Health campaign flyers, as in this example from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], warn the public about unsafe products.]]

In Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with [[Medical degree|MDs]],&lt;ref name=ernstinterview/&gt; and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs.&lt;ref name="Cassileth1996"/&gt; In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.&lt;ref name="JAMA_book_review"/&gt;

Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic]], have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world{{sfn|WHO|2005}} and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.{{sfn|WHO|2005}}

Government bodies in the US and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/default.htm|title=Medication Health Fraud|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm207747.htm|title=Alternative Medicine Fraud|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the FDA before marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm050798.htm FDA, ''Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks and problems==

=== Negative outcomes ===
{{See also|List of herbs with known adverse effects}}

====Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety====

Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niggemann|first1=B.|last2=Grüber|first2=C.|title=Side-effects of complementary and alternative medicine|journal=Allergy|date=22 February 2003|volume=58|issue=8|pages=707–16|doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00219.x|pmid=12859546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the way it's regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.&lt;ref name="Colquhoun2012"/&gt;  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.

Advocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.&lt;ref name="Connelly2012"/&gt; Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).&lt;ref name="Malcolm2012"/&gt;

====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.&lt;ref name=CassilethDeng2004/&gt; An example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor [[Alastair MacLennan (medicine)|Alastair MacLennan]] of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking "natural" potions to "build up her strength" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.&lt;ref name="Hills1999"/&gt;

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.&lt;ref name="SwanABC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Side-effects====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment&amp;nbsp;– whether conventional or alternative&amp;nbsp;– that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., "That which is natural cannot be harmful." Specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of herbal remedies among patients undergoing hemodialysis|journal=Iran J Kidney Dis|pmid=24241097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258636639_Use_of_herbal_remedies_among_patients_undergoing_hemodialysis|volume=7|issue=6|date=Nov 2013|pages=492–95|author1=Roozbeh|first1=J|last2=Hashempur|first2=M.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in "several significantly different ways from other drugs."&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt; Homeopathic preparations, termed "remedies", are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but "their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength", and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt;

=====Treatment delay=====

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.&lt;ref name="Navarro2006"/&gt; For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, "unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments" and refers to this as "[[opportunity cost]]". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lilienfeld2002/&gt; Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.&lt;ref name=Hughes2010/&gt;

====Unconventional cancer "cures"====

There have always been "many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as 'unproven,' suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown." However, "many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective....The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'."&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition. There will never be an alternative cancer cure. Why? Because if something looked halfway promising, then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it, and if there is anything to it, it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly. All curative "alternative cancer cures" are based on false claims, are bogus, and, I would say, even criminal.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Gabriel |date=2 September 2014 |title=Asking the Experts: Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Cancer |work=[[Medscape]] |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830553_print |accessdate=7 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rejection of science===

"CAM", meaning "complementary and alternative medicine", is not as well researched as conventional medicine, which undergoes intense research before release to the public.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of CAM.&lt;ref name="Ernst4" /&gt; Most funding for CAM is funded by government agencies.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Proposed research for CAM are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt;  The research for CAM has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees, which most CAM researchers find almost impossible to meet.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Even with the little research done on it, CAM has not been proven to be effective.&lt;ref name="Ernst3" /&gt;

[[Steven Novella]], a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that government funded studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream are "used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt; Marcia Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science-based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered "alternative" to begin with.&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt; It is possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. A prominent supporter of this position is [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).&lt;ref name="Fontanarosa1998" /&gt;

Writing in 1999 in ''CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians'' [[Barrie R. Cassileth]] mentioned a 1997 letter to the [[US Senate]] Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists. (This was supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).)&lt;ref name="Cassileth1999" /&gt;

In March 2009 a staff writer for ''[[the Washington Post]]'' reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. They quoted one of these scientists, [[Steven Salzberg]], a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, as saying "One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience."  They noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of [[physiology]] and [[disease]], and had shown little or no effect.&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt;

Writers such as [[Carl Sagan]], a noted astrophysicist, advocate of [[scientific skepticism]] and the author of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'' (1996), have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.{{sfn|Sagan|1996}}

Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated [[fallacy|contradiction]] without thorough reason and experiment.&lt;ref name="SampsonAtwood2005" /&gt; Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt; Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some "alternatives" have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="Quackwatch_wary" /&gt;

Some critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems, notably [[Wallace Sampson]] and [[Paul Kurtz]] founders of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]] and [[Stephen Barrett]], co-founder of [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]] and webmaster of [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref name="NCAHF_mission" /&gt; Grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that:
* It is usually based on [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, or fraud.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Other_sources" /&gt;
* Alternative therapies typically lack any [[scientific validation]], and their effectiveness is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldrosen2004" /&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2013}}
* Treatments are not part of the conventional, science-based healthcare system.&lt;ref name="WHO_Trad_Med_Defs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17–19]}}&lt;ref name="Zollman1999" /&gt;
* Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=146 146]}}
* Where alternative treatments have replaced conventional science-based medicine, even with the safest alternative medicines, failure to use or delay in using conventional science-based medicine has caused deaths.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes2010" /&gt;
* Methods may incorporate or base themselves on [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles, errors in reasoning, or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acharya2008" /&gt;

Many alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy&amp;nbsp;– also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.&lt;ref name="Ernst2005" /&gt;

English evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], in his 2003 book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', defined alternative medicine as a "set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests."&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003" /&gt; Dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.&lt;ref name="Holloway2003" /&gt;

CAM is also often less regulated than conventional medicine.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to treat patients.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; CAM is often done by non-physicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine,&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; and it is often described as an issue of [[non-maleficence]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2" /&gt;

According to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K. Butler, marketing is part of the training required in alternative medicine, and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by [[Hitler]] and [[Goebels]] in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ButlerBarrett1992" /&gt;

In November 2011 [[Edzard Ernst]] stated that the "level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this."&lt;ref name="Ernst_Guardian" /&gt;

=== Conflicts of interest ===

Some commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] in alternative medicine. [[Edzard Ernst]] has said  that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of "unidirectional bias" because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject.&lt;ref name="unid"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernst E|authorlink=Edzard Ernst|year=2011|title=Conflicts of Interest in Alternative Medicine|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/conflicts_of_interest_in_alternative_medicine|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=35|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100% of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in China had positive conclusions.&lt;ref name="unid" /&gt; [[David Gorski]] contrasts [[evidence-based medicine]], in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses, with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudoscience-based research, of striving to confirm pre-existing notions.&lt;ref name="gorski"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/conflicts-of-interest-in-science-based-medicine/|title=Conflicts of interest in science-based medicine|author=Gorski D|authorlink=David Gorski|date=16 November 2009|publisher=[[Science-Based Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harriet Hall]] writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists: in the case of acupuncture, for example, an acupuncturist would have "a great deal to lose" if acupuncture were rejected by research; but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed; rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/conflicts-of-interest/|title=Conflicts of interest|author=Hall HA|authorlink=Harriet A.

{{Continuum mechanics|fluid}}
'''Archimedes' principle''' states that the upward [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] that is exerted on a body immersed in a [[fluid]], whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the [[weight]] of the fluid that the body [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] and acts in the upward direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes' principle is a [[law of physics]] fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="acottLaw"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Acott, Chris |title=The diving "Law-ers": A brief resume of their lives. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5990 |accessdate=2009-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Image:Principio di Archimede galleggiamento.png|thumb|A floating ship's weight F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and its buoyancy F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; must be equal in size.]]
In ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'', Archimedes suggested that (c. 250 BC):
{{Quotation|Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.}}

Practically, Archimedes' principle allows the buoyancy of an object partially or fully immersed in a fluid to be calculated. The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes' principle, above. Thus, the net force on the object is the difference between the magnitudes of the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant - that is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes' principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body.

==Formula==

Consider a cuboid immersed in a fluid, with one (hence two: top and bottom) of its sides orthogonal to the direction of gravity (assumed constant across the cube's stretch). The fluid will exert a [[normal force]] on each face, but only the normal forces on top and bottom will contribute to buoyancy. The [[pressure]] difference between the bottom and the top face is directly proportional to the height (difference in depth of submersion). Multiplying the pressure difference by the area of a face gives a net force on the cuboid – the buoyancy, equaling in size the weight of the fluid displaced by the cuboid. By summing up sufficiently many arbitrarily small cuboids this reasoning may be extended to irregular shapes, and so, whatever the shape of the submerged body, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{ weight of displaced fluid} = \text{weight of object in vacuum} - \text{weight of object in fluid}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[weight]] of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force (F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the [[density]] ([[Rho|ρ]]) of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume (V) times the [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]] (g) or  F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Rho|ρ]] x g x V.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy.

Suppose a rock's weight is measured as 10 [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s when suspended by a string in a [[vacuum]] with gravity acting on it. Suppose that, when the rock is lowered into water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of buoyant force: 10&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea floor. It is generally easier to lift an object up through the water than it is to pull it out of the water.

For a fully submerged object, Archimedes' principle can be reformulated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{apparent immersed weight} = \text{weight of object} - \text{weight of displaced fluid}\,&lt;/math&gt;

then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the mutual volume

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text{density of object}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text{weight of displaced fluid} }&lt;/math&gt;

yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volume is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text {density of object}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text{weight} - \text{apparent immersed weight}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

(This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a [[dasymeter]] and of [[hydrostatic weighing]].)

Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat.

Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. When increasing speed or driving in a curve, the air moves in the opposite direction to the car's acceleration. However, due to buoyancy, the balloon is pushed "out of the way" by the air, and will actually drift in the same direction as the car's acceleration.

When an object is immersed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force, which is known as the buoyant force, that is proportional to the weight of the displaced liquid. The sum force acting on the object, then, is equal to the difference between the weight of the object ('down' force) and the weight of displaced liquid ('up' force). Equilibrium, or neutral buoyancy, is achieved when these two weights (and thus forces) are equal.

==Refinements==

Archimedes' principle does not consider the [[surface tension]] (capillarity) acting on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fnfal/papers/Natfloat.pdf |title=Floater clustering in a standing wave: Capillarity effects drive hydrophilic or hydrophobic particles to congregate at specific points on a wave | date=2005-06-23 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Archimedes' principle has been found to break down in [[complex fluid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Archimedes’s principle gets updated". R. Mark Wilson, ''Physics Today'' '''65'''(9), 15 (2012); {{doi|10.1063/PT.3.1701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of flotation==
Archimedes' principle shows the  buoyant force and displacement of fluid. However, the concept of Archimedes' principle can be applied when considering why objects float. Proposition 5 of Archimedes' treatise ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' states that:

{{Quotation|Any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid.| [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]&lt;ref name=archimedes&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/worksofarchimede00arch#page/256/mode/2up|title=The works of Archimedes|page=257|accessdate=11 March 2010|quote=Any solid lighter than a fluid will, if placed in the fluid, be so far immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, for an object floating on a liquid surface (like a boat) or floating submerged in a fluid (like a [[submarine]] in water or [[dirigible]] in air) the weight of the displaced liquid equals the weight of the object. Thus, only in the special case of floating does the buoyant force acting on an object equal the objects weight. Consider a 1-ton block of solid iron. As iron is nearly eight times as dense as water, it displaces only 1/8 ton of water when submerged, which is not enough to keep it afloat. Suppose the same iron block is reshaped into a bowl. It still weighs 1 ton, but when it is put in water, it displaces a greater volume of water than when it was a block. The deeper the iron bowl is immersed, the more water it displaces, and the greater the buoyant force acting on it. When the buoyant force equals 1 ton, it will sink no farther.

When any boat displaces a weight of water equal to its own weight, it floats. This is often called the "principle of flotation": A floating object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. Every ship, submarine, and dirigible must be designed to displace a weight of fluid at least equal to its own weight. A 10,000-ton ship's hull must be built wide enough, long enough and deep enough to displace 10,000 tons of water and still have some hull above the water to prevent it from sinking. It needs extra hull to fight waves that would otherwise fill it and, by increasing its mass, cause it to submerge. The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to displace 100 tons of air. If it displaces more, it rises; if it displaces less, it falls. If the dirigible displaces exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude.

While they are related to it, the principle of flotation and the concept that a submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume are ''not'' Archimedes' principle. Archimedes' principle, as stated above, equates the ''buoyant force'' to the weight of the fluid displaced.

One common point of confusion{{by whom|date=May 2018}} regarding Archimedes' principle is the meaning of displaced volume. Common demonstrations involve measuring the rise in water level when an object floats on the surface in order to calculate the displaced water. This measurement approach fails with a buoyant submerged object because the rise in the water level is directly related to the volume of the object and not the mass (except if the effective density of the object equals exactly the fluid density).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt;

* "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]," reportedly exclaimed by Archimedes upon discovery that the volume of displaced fluid is equal to the volume of the submerged object. Archimedes also used this principle to help [[Hiero II of Syracuse#As King of Syracuse|Hiero II]] with his problem with a golden crown.&lt;ref&gt;https://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/crown.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.longlongtimeago.com/once-upon-a-time/great-discoveries/eureka-the-story-of-archimedes-and-the-golden-crown/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ask A Biologist''' is a [[science outreach]] program originating from [[Arizona State University]]'s School of [[Life Sciences]].

==About the program==

Ask A Biologist is a pre-kindergarten through high school program dedicated to answering questions from students, their teachers, and parents. The primary focus of the program is to connect students and teachers with working scientists through a question and answer Web e-mail form. The companion website also includes a large collection of free content and activities that can be used inside, as well as outside, of the classroom. The award-winning program has been continuously running for more than 14 years, with the assistance of more than 150 volunteer scientists, faculty, and graduate students in biology and related fields. In 2010 the program released its new website interface and features that became the subject for articles in the journals

===Primary audience===

Ask A Biologist materials are free and open to anyone with access to the [[World Wide Web|World-Wide-Web]]. The question portion of the program serves primarily students, grades pre[[K–12 (education)|K-12]], as well as their teachers and parents. In addition, lifelong learners are encouraged to use the website materials.

===History===

Ask A Biologist was launched late in 1997 in the School of Life Sciences, with an early version&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=February 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewable on the [[Internet Archive]] a.k.a. The WayBackMachine. Initially, the site consisted solely of a question submission form, a feature that remains one of its core activities.

By 2001, the site had grown to over 1,000 pages of content, including articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, quizzes, and science activities.

In 2003, the website released the Virtual Pocket Seed Experiment, the first of several data sets that could be used in and outside of the classroom. The experiment was based on the classic seed germination experiment, but included the feature of time-lapse animation of various seed experiments.

In 2004, a second data set was released, in cooperation with [[Audubon International|Audubon]] Arizona. The Virtual Bird Aviary, included the majority of bird species found in the Southwest United States including more than 400 vocal recordings and companion [[Spectrogram|sonograms]], bird images, text descriptions, and range maps.

In 2005, the website was peer reviewed by the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), earning a "five out of five star" rating.&lt;ref name="rc2"&gt;{{cite web

|date= 2005 |accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=MERLOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, the website introduced the Mysterious World of Dr. Biology a [[Comics in education|comic book]] adventure. The activity encouraged students to piece together a mystery. Students reconstructed a chain of events in the Dr. Biology laboratory and field site, writing their own narrative for the story.

Early in 2007, Ask A Biologist became one of the early content channels on [[iTunes]] U with its audio [[podcast]] of the same name. Hosted by Dr. Biology, the program was soon listed as one of five great courses by Macworld.&lt;ref name="rc3"&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, the audio podcast program introduced a co-host contest&lt;ref name="rc4"&gt;{{cite web

In 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded the redesign of the Ask A Biologist website including the addition of [[Web 2.0]] tools as part of the [[National Science Digital Library]] (NSDL).

In 2010, Ask A Biologist released its new website developed using a Web content management tool [[Drupal]] and adding Web 2.0 options. The new content management expanded website features including translations of content into French and Spanish and an improved interface for audio streaming. The website was officially accessioned by the NSDL in September.

In 2011 two new sections were added to the website. Body Depot is a collaborative project with the [[Arizona Science Center]] funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). PLOSable is a project that links plain language and kid-friendly reviews to primary source publications in journals of the [[Public Library of Science]].

{{Alternative medicine sidebar}}

The '''Bates method''' is an [[alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] aimed at improving [[visual acuity|eyesight]]. Eye-care physician [[William Bates (physician)|William Horatio Bates]], M.D. (1860–1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to [[Habit (psychology)|habitual]] strain of the eyes, and felt that [[glasses]] were harmful and never necessary. Bates self-published a book, ''[[s:Perfect Sight Without Glasses|Perfect Sight Without Glasses]]'', as well as a magazine, ''[[s:Better Eyesight Magazine|Better Eyesight Magazine]]'', (and earlier collaborated with [[Bernarr MacFadden]] on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to helping people relax such "strain", and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His techniques centered on visualization and movement. He placed particular emphasis on imagining [[black]] letters and marks, and the movement of such. He also felt that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate the "strain".&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book |last = Gardner |first = Martin |title = [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year = 1957 |chapter = Chapter 19: Throw Away Your Glasses! |pages = 230–41 |publisher = [[Courier Dover Publications]] |isbn = 0486203948 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp;pg=PA232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continued [[anecdotal]] reports of successful results, including well-publicised support by [[Aldous Huxley]], Bates' techniques have not been [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] shown to improve eyesight.&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/features/natural-vision-correction-does-it-work |title = Natural Vision Correction: Does It Work? |first = Leanna |last = Skarnulis |publisher = [[WebMD]] |date = 5 February 2007 |accessdate = 14 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main [[physiological]] proposition—that the eyeball changes shape to maintain [[Focus (optics)|focus]]—has consistently been contradicted by observation.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;{{cite book |last = Pollack |first = Philip |title = The Truth about Eye Exercises |location = Philadelphia |publisher = [[Chilton Company]] |year = 1956 |chapter = Chapter 3: Fallacies of the Bates System |chapterurl = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4399673;view=1up;seq=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, optometry professor [[Elwin Marg]] wrote of Bates, "Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists."&lt;ref name="Chou"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Review of Optometry |url = http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/therapeutics/c/17353/ |title = Exposing the Secrets of Fringe Eye Care |first = Brian |last = Chou |volume = 141 |number = 9 |date = 15 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to "flashes of clear vision" experienced by many who followed it.&lt;ref name=Marg&gt;{{cite journal |last = Marg |first = Elwin |title = Flashes of clear vision and negative accommodation with reference to the Bates Method of visual training |journal = American Journal of Optometry &amp; Archives of American Academy of Optometry |date = April 1952 |volume = 29 |issue = 4 |pages = 167–84 |doi = 10.1097/00006324-195204000-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such occurrences have since been explained as a [[contact lens]]-like effect of moisture on the eye,&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles.&lt;ref name="Raz2004a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raz2004b" /&gt;

The Bates method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.&lt;ref name="Chou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grierson"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Eye Book: Eyes and Eye Problems Explained |first = Ian |last = Grierson |publisher = [[Liverpool University Press]] |year = 2000 |chapter = Exercises for Eyes as an Alternative to Glasses |pages = 58–60 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=YY0inTk-CEcC&amp;pg=PA58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying concepts ==

=== Accommodation ===

[[Accommodation (eye)|Accommodation]] is the process by which the eye increases [[optical power]] to maintain [[focus (optics)|focus]] on the [[retina]] while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the [[ciliary muscle]], a muscle ''within'' the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]].&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; This explanation is based in the observed effect of [[atropine]] temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as "so blurred that it is impossible to tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to [[Timeline of photography technology|later photographs]] that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

Bates adhered to a different explanation of accommodation that had already been generally disregarded by the medical community of his time. Bates' model had the [[extraocular muscles|muscles ''surrounding'' the eyeball]] controlling its focus.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; In addition to their known function of turning the eye, Bates maintained, they also affect its shape,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884800,00.html |title = Exercise v. Eyeglasses |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = 15 March 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; elongating the eyeball to focus at the near-point or shortening it to focus at a distance.&lt;ref name="BatesChap4"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 4: The Truth About Accommodation as Demonstrated by Experiments on the Eye Muscles of Fish, Cats, Dogs, Rabbits and other Animals |pages = 38–53 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA38 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this hypothesis in an interview with [[WebMD]], ophthalmologist Richard E. Bensinger stated "When we put drops in the eye to dilate the pupil, they paralyze the focusing muscles. The evidence of the anatomical fallacy is that you can't focus, but your eye can move up and down, left and right. The notion that external muscles affect focusing is totally wrong."&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; Science author [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] writes that many animals, such as fishes, accommodate by elongation of the eyeball, "it's just that humans aren't one of those animals."&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book |first = John |last = Grant |title = Discarded Science |year = 2006 |publisher = FFF |location = Surrey, UK |isbn = 1904332498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory tests have shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be necessary to accomplish what Bates described.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 [[micrometre]]s) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 [[dioptre]]s.&lt;ref name=Drexler&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science |date = 1 October 1998 |volume = 39 |issue = 11 |pages = 2140–47 |title = Eye elongation during accommodation in humans: differences between emmetropes and myopes |last = Drexler |first = W |last2 = Findl |first2 = O |last3 = Schmetterer |first3 = L |last4 = Hitzenberger |first4 = CK |last5 = Fercher |first5 = AF |url = http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/39/11/2140 |pmid = 9761293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes of sight problems ===

Medical professionals characterize [[refractive errors]] such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and [[presbyopia]] (the age-related blurring of near-point vision) as consequences of the eye's shape and other basic anatomy, which there is no evidence that any exercise can alter.&lt;ref name=AllAboutVision /&gt; Bates, however, believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball, which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape (per his explanation of accommodation) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther. Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a "mental strain" to see, the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesChap9"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 9: The Cause and Cure of Errors of Refraction |pages = 89–105 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA89 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also linked disturbances in the [[circulatory system|circulation]] of blood, which he said is "very largely influenced by thought", not only to refractive errors but also to [[diplopia|double vision]], [[strabismus|crossed-eye]], [[amblyopia|lazy eye]], and to more serious eye conditions such as [[cataract]]s and [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesChap10"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 10: Strain |pages = 106–13 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA106 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His therapies were based on these assumptions.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

Bates felt that [[corrective lenses]], which he characterized as "eye crutches", are an impediment to curing poor vision. In his view, "strain" would increase as the eyes adjust to the correction in front of them. He thus recommended that [[glasses]] be discarded by anyone applying his method.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

== Treatments ==

In his writings, Bates discussed several techniques that he claimed helped patients to improve their sight. He wrote "The ways in which people strain to see are infinite, and the methods used to relieve the strain must be almost equally varied,"&lt;ref name="BatesChap9" /&gt; emphasizing that no single approach would work for everyone. His techniques were all designed to help disassociate this "strain" from seeing and thereby achieve "central fixation", or seeing what is in the central point of vision without staring. He asserted that "all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of the eye disappear when it sees by central fixation" and that other conditions were often relieved as well.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

=== Palming ===
[[File:Batespalming.png|thumb|Photo of someone "palming", from ''Perfect Sight Without Glasses''.]]

Bates suggested closing the eyes for minutes at a time to help bring about relaxation.&lt;ref name="BatesChap12" /&gt; He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by "palming", or covering the closed eyes with the palms of the hands, without putting pressure on the eyeballs.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; If the covered eyes did not strain, he said, they would see "a field so black that it is impossible to remember, imagine, or see anything blacker", since light was excluded by the palms. However, he reported that some of his patients experienced "illusions of lights and colors" sometimes amounting to "kaleidoscopic appearances" as they "palmed", occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous "strain" and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed.&lt;ref name="BatesChap12"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 12: Palming |pages = 123–35 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA123 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, however, was almost certainly caused by [[Eigengrau]] or "dark light". In fact, even in conditions of perfect darkness, as inside a cave, neurons at every level of the [[visual system]] produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

=== Visualization ===

Bates placed importance on [[mental image]]s, as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight.&lt;ref name="Biomed"&gt;{{cite book |title = Ethics in Biomedical Research: International Perspectives |first = Frank J. |last = Leavitt |publisher = [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]] |year = 2007 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=-Tr7WZd_GwQC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;vq=Bates&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U0N8ztV_WZnlDRcO3L3J6GH140ceA |chapter = How to Save the World: Alternatives to Biomedical Research |pages = 203–07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by the visual memory of black; that the darker it appeared in the mind, and the smaller the area of black that could be imagined, the more relaxed one was at the moment.&lt;ref name="BatesChap13" /&gt; He recommended that patients think of the top letter from an [[Snellen chart|eye chart]] and then visualize progressively smaller black letters, and eventually a period or comma.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; But he emphasized his view that the clear visual memory of black "cannot be attained by any sort of effort", stating that "the memory is not the cause of the relaxation, but must be preceded by it,"&lt;ref name="BatesChap13"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 13: Memory as an Aid to Vision |pages = 136–47 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA136 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cautioned against "concentrating" on black, as he regarded an attempt to "think of one thing only" as a strain.&lt;ref name="BatesChap12" /&gt;

While Bates preferred to have patients imagine something black, he also reported that some found objects of other colors easiest to visualize, and thus were benefited most by remembering those, because, he asserted, "the memory can never be perfect unless it is easy."&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesChap13" /&gt; Skeptics reason that the only benefit to eyesight gained from such techniques is ''itself'' imagined, and point out that familiar objects, including letters on an eye chart, can be recognized even when they appear less than clear.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

=== Movement ===

He thought that the manner of eye movement affected the sight. He suggested "shifting", or moving the eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects "swinging" in the opposite direction. He believed that the smaller the area over which the "swing" was experienced, the greater was the benefit to sight. He also indicated that it was usually helpful to close the eyes and ''imagine'' something "swinging". By alternating actual and mental shifting over an image, Bates wrote, many patients were quickly able to shorten the "shift" to a point where they could "conceive and swing a letter the size of a period in a newspaper".&lt;ref name="BatesChap15"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 15: Shifting and Swinging |pages = 159–71 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA159 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One who mastered this would attain the "universal swing", Bates believed.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

Perhaps finding Bates' concepts of "shifting" and "swinging" too complicated, some proponents of vision improvement, such as [[Bernarr Macfadden]], suggested simply moving the eyes up and down, from side to side, and shifting one's gaze between a near-point and a far-point.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

=== Sunning ===

[[File:BurningGlass.png|thumb|A [[burning-glass]] being used to focus sunlight on someone's eye, from ''Perfect Sight Without Glasses''.]]

Bates believed that the eyes were benefited by exposure to sunlight. He stated that "persons with normal sight can look directly at the sun, or at the strongest artificial light, without injury or discomfort,"&lt;ref name="Sungazing"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Better Eyesight |first = William H. |last = Bates |title = [[s:Better Eyesight Magazine/June 1920#SUN-GAZING|Sun-gazing]] |date = June 1920 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave several examples of patients' vision purportedly improving after [[sungazing]]{{snd}}this is at variance with the well-known risk of [[Solar retinopathy|eye damage]] that can result from [[Watch sun directly|direct sunlight observation]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grierson"/&gt;

Bates said that, just as one should not attempt to run a marathon without training, one should not immediately look ''directly'' at the sun, but he suggested that it could be worked up to. He acknowledged that looking at the sun could have ill effects, but characterized them as being "always temporary" and in fact the effects of strain in ''response'' to sunlight. He wrote that he had cured people who believed that the sun had caused them permanent eye damage.&lt;ref name="BatesChap17"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 17: Vision Under Adverse Conditions a Benefit to the Eyes |pages = 183–97 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA183 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magazine, Bates later suggested exposing only the white part of the eyeball to direct sunlight, and only for seconds at a time, after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Better Eyesight |first = William H. |last = Bates |title = The Use of the Sun Glass |date = July 1929 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |url = http://www.central-fixation.com/better-eyesight-magazine/better-eyesight-1929-07.php#sun-glass }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumous publications of Bates' book omitted mention of the supposed benefits from direct sunlight shining on open eyes.&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt;

== Results and criticism ==

Bates' techniques have never been scientifically established to improve eyesight.&lt;ref name=WebMD /&gt; Several of Bates' techniques, including "sunning", "swinging", and "palming", were combined with healthy changes to diet and exercise in a 1983 [[randomized controlled trial]] of myopic children in India. After 6 months, the experimental groups "did not show any statistically significant difference in refractive status", though the children in the treatment group "[[subjectivity|subjectively]] … felt relieved of eye strain and other symptoms".&lt;ref name = Mohan&gt;{{cite journal |first = Madan |last = Mohan |title = Therapy of myopia |journal = Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |year = 1983 |volume = 31 |pages = 741–43 |url = http://www.ijo.in/text.asp?1983/31/6/741/29315 |issue = 6 |pmid = 6676257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the [[British Medical Journal]] observed that "Bates […] advocated prolonged sun-gazing as the
treatment of myopia, with disastrous results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1136/bmj.3.5559.212 |title = Solar retinopathy |year = 1967 |last1 = Ridgway |first1 = A. E. |journal = [[British Medical Journal]] |volume = 3 |issue = 5559 |pages = 212–14 |pmid = 6028468 |pmc = 1842517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt has argued that the method Bates described would be [[Testability|difficult to test]] scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked "How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?" In regards to the possibility of a [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo trial]], Leavitt commented "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not."&lt;ref name="Biomed" /&gt;

== After Bates ==

After Bates died in 1931, his methods of treatment were continued by his widow Emily and other associates,&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; some of whom incorporated exercises and dietary recommendations.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; Most subsequent proponents did not stand by Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses mechanically,&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; but nonetheless maintained that relieving a habitual "strain" was the key to improving sight.&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt;

=== Margaret Darst Corbett ===

Margaret Darst Corbett first met Bates when she consulted him about her husband's eyesight. She became his pupil, and eventually taught his method at her School of Eye Education in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=fullpollack7&gt;{{cite book |last = Pollack |first = Philip |title = The Truth about Eye Exercises |year = 1956 |publisher = [[Chilton Company]] |location = Philadelphia |page = 7 |url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4399673;view=1up;seq=7 |accessdate = 2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was of the stated belief that "the optic nerve is really part of the brain, and vision is nine-tenths mental and one-tenth only physical."&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corbett"&gt;{{cite book |last = Corbett |first = Margaret Darst |title = How to Improve your Sight |year = 1954 |publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] |location = London |pages = 26–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1940, Corbett and her assistant were charged with violations of the Medical Practice Act of California for treating eyes without a licence. At the trial, many of her students testified on her behalf, describing in detail how she had enabled them to discard their glasses. One witness testified that he had been almost blind from cataracts, but that, after working with Corbett, his vision had improved to such an extent that for the first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses. Corbett explained in court that she was practicing neither [[optometry]] nor [[ophthalmology]] and represented herself not as a doctor but only as an "instructor of eye training". Describing her method she said "We turn vision on by teaching the eyes to shift. We want the sense of motion to relieve staring, to end the fixed look. We use light to relax the eyes and to accustom them to the sun."&lt;ref name=fullpollack7 /&gt;

The trial attracted widespread interest, as did the "not guilty" verdict. The case spurred a bill in the Californian State Legislature that would have then made such vision education illegal without an optometric or medical licence. After a lively campaign in the media, the bill was rejected.&lt;ref name=fullpollack8&gt;{{cite book |last = Pollack |first = Philip |title = The Truth about Eye Exercises |year = 1956 |publisher = [[Chilton Company]] |location = Philadelphia |page = 8 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=yJesAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Corbett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aldous Huxley ===

[[File:Aldous Huxley.JPG|thumb|[[Aldous Huxley]]]]

Perhaps the most famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer [[Aldous Huxley]]. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of [[keratitis]], which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light perception and the other with an unaided [[Snellen fraction]] of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both [[cornea]]s, complicated by [[hyperopia]] and [[astigmatism]]. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with [[atropine]], to allow that eye to see around an opacity in the center of the cornea.&lt;ref name="Ceylon"&gt;{{cite journal |title = 'Fifty per cent terrific! fifty per cent non-existent': Aldous Huxley and medicine |journal = The Ceylon Medical Journal |volume = 49 |issue = 4 |pages = 142–43 |date = December 2004 |doi = 10.4038/cmj.v49i4.1932 |last1 = Basnayake |first1 = V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, at the age of 45 and with eyesight that continued to deteriorate, he happened to hear of the Bates method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett, who gave him regular lessons.&lt;ref name="Ceylon" /&gt; Three years later he wrote ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', in which he related: "Within a couple of months I was reading without spectacles and, what was better still, without strain and fatigue.... At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is about twice as good as it used to be when I wore spectacles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Aldous Huxley, Man of Letters: Thinker, Critic and Artist: Proceedings of the Third International Aldous Huxley Symposium, Riga 2004 |first = Bernfried |last = Nugel |publisher = LIT Verlag |location = Berlin-Hamburg-Münster |year = 2008 |page = 250 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=jkC0gvN12DMC&amp;pg=PA250 |isbn = 978-3825890346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the process, Huxley wrote that "Vision is not won by making an effort to get it: it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity, of dynamic relaxation." He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses, stating that "my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation, but with the art of seeing."&lt;ref name=Marg /&gt;

His case generated wide publicity as well as scrutiny. Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster, for example, suggested in 1944 that Huxley had "learned how to use what he has to better advantage" by training the "cerebral part of seeing", rather than actually improving the quality of the image on the [[retina]].&lt;ref name=Marg /&gt;

In 1952, ten years after writing ''The Art of Seeing'', Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and, according to [[Bennett Cerf]], apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty. In Cerf's words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this, Huxley wrote "I often do use magnifying glasses where conditions of light are bad, and have never claimed to be able to read except under very good conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Letters of Aldous Huxley |first = Grover Cleveland |last = Smith |publisher = [[Harper &amp; Row]] |year = 1970 |page = 815 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=zcIZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22I+often+do+use+magnifying+glasses+where+conditions+of+light+are+bad%2C+and+have+never+claimed+to+be+able+to+read+except+under+very+good+conditions.%22 |isbn = 070111312X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This underscored that he had not regained anything close to normal vision, and in fact never claimed that he had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Aldous Huxley: A Biography |first = Nicholas |last = Murray |publisher = Macmillan |year = 2003 |chapter = Sorrow |pages = 421–22 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=ktDo9SCBfxoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA421 |isbn = 0312302371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern variants ===

"Natural vision correction" or "natural vision improvement" continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction, many of whom have no medical or optometric credentials. Most base their approach in the Bates method, though some also integrate [[vision therapy]] techniques.&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; There are also many [[self-help]] books and programs, which have not been subjected to [[randomized controlled trials]], aimed at improving eyesight naturally.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Harvard Women's Health Watch |title = I can see clearly now … sort of |date = 1 July 2003 |url = http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2994518/I-can-see-clearly-now.html }}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purveyors of such approaches argue that they lack the funds to formally test them.&lt;ref name="educators"&gt;{{cite news |first = Robyn E. |last = Bradley |title = Advocates see only benefits from eye exercises |work = The Boston Globe |date = 23 September 2003 |url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2003/09/23/advocates_see_only_benefits_from_eye_exercises/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavily advertised "[[See Clearly Method]]" (of which sales were halted by a court order in November 2006, in response to what were found to be dishonest marketing practices)&lt;ref name=Shin&gt;{{cite news |first = Annys |last = Shin |url = http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thecheckout/2006/11/hold_onto_those_eyeglasses.html |title = Seeing the See Clearly Method for What It Is |date = 6 November 2006 |work = The Washington Post |accessdate = 14 March 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061110130445/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thecheckout/2006/11/hold_onto_those_eyeglasses.html |archive-date = 10 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included "palming" and "light therapy", both adapted from Bates.&lt;ref name=AllAboutVision&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.allaboutvision.com/buysmart/see_clearly.htm |title = The See Clearly Method &amp; Other Programs: Do Eye Exercises Improve Vision? |date = May 2009 |publisher = AllAboutVision.com |first1 = Rob |last1 = Murphy |first2 = Marilyn |last2 = Haddrill |first3 = Gary |last3 = Heiting |accessdate = 14 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the program, however, emphasized that they did not endorse Bates' approach overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Steven M. |last1=Beresford |first2=David W. |last2=Muris |first3=Mara |last3=Tableman |first4=Francis A. |last4=Young |url=http://www.strong-eyes.com/RESEARCH%20MASTER.pdf |format=PDF |title=Clinical Evaluation of the See Clearly Method |page=13 |accessdate=14 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224053114/http://www.strong-eyes.com/RESEARCH%20MASTER.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1992 book ''The Bates Method, A Complete Guide to Improving Eyesight—Naturally'', "Bates method teacher" Peter Mansfield was very critical of [[eye care professional]]s for prescribing corrective lenses, recommending most of Bates' techniques to improve vision. The book included accounts of twelve "real cases", but did not report any information about [[refractive error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1097/00006324-199711000-00020 |title = The Bates Method, A Complete Guide to Improving Eyesight—Naturally [Review] |year = 1997 |last1 = Grosvenor |first1 = Theodore |journal = Optometry and Vision Science |volume = 74 |issue = 11 |page = 880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech native John Slavicek claims to have created an "eye cure" that improves eyesight in three days, borrowing from ancient yogic eye exercises, visualizations from the [[Seth Material]], and the Bates method. Although he has testimonials from his neighbor and others, several of his students indicate that he has greatly exaggerated their cases. Slavicek's self-published manual, ''Yoga for the Eyes'', was rejected by an ophthalmologist who evaluated it, and evinced no interest from the [[World Health Organization]] and St. Erik's Eye Foundation in Sweden as he had not conducted [[double-blind]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Prague Post |location=Czech Republic |title=Blind faith |first=Kristin |last=Barendsen |date=20 November 2003 |url=http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/38282-blind-faith.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603051744/http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/38282-blind-faith.html |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anecdotal support ==

In support of the effectiveness of the Bates method, proponents point to the many accounts of people allegedly having improved their eyesight by applying it.&lt;ref name=WebMD /&gt; While these anecdotes may be told and passed on in [[good faith]], several potential explanations exist for the phenomena reported other than a genuine reversal of a [[refractive error]] due to the techniques practiced:
* Some cases of nearsightedness are recognized as due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle, rather than a misshapen eyeball. These are classed as [[pseudomyopia]], of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S Leo |author2=Y Ling |author3=T Wong |author4=B Quah |location=Singapore |journal=Annals-Academy of Medicine |url=http://www.annals.edu.sg/PDF/36VolNo10SupplOct2007/V36N10(S1)pS65.pdf |format=PDF |date=October 2007 |title=Report of the National Myopia Prevention and Control Workgroup 2006: A Summary |volume=36 |issue=10 |page=67 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419104601/http://www.annals.edu.sg/PDF/36VolNo10SupplOct2007/V36N10%28S1%29pS65.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Research has confirmed that when nearsighted subjects remove their corrective lenses, over time there is a limited improvement (termed "blur adaptation") in their unaided visual resolution, even though [[Refraction#Clinical significance|refraction]] indicates no corresponding change in refractive error.&lt;ref name=Rosenfield&gt;{{cite journal |title = Blur Adaptation in Myopes |first1 = Mark |last1 = Rosenfield |first2 = Susan |last2 = Hong |first3 = Sini |last3 = George |date = September 2004 |url = http://www.optvissci.com/pt/re/ovs/fulltext.00006324-200409000-00009.htm |volume = 81 |issue = 9 |pages = 657–62 |journal = Optometry and Vision Science |doi = 10.1097/01.opx.0000144743.34976.da |pmid = 15365384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed to occur due to adjustments made in the [[visual system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = American Academy of Optometry |title = Decreased Uncorrected Vision After a Period of Distance Fixation with Spectacle Wear |first1 = Konrad |last1 = Pesudovs |first2 = Noel A. |last2 = Brennan |year = 1993 |volume = 70 |issue = 7 |pages = 528–31 |url = http://www.pesudovs.com/konrad/Docs/Brennan.pdf |format = PDF |doi = 10.1097/00006324-199307000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One who has been practicing Bates' techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving the glasses off would have had the same effect, which may be especially pronounced if the [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] was too strong to begin with.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;
* Visual acuity is affected by the size of the pupil. When it [[Miosis|constricts]] (such as in response to an increase in light), the quality of focus will improve significantly, at the cost of a reduced ability to see in dim light. This is known as the "[[Diffraction-limited system|pinhole effect]]".&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; This concept is also used in photography when changing the [[aperture]] size.
* Some eye defects may naturally change for the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder suggested that this is what happened with Aldous Huxley&lt;ref name="DukeElder"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Stewart |last = Duke-Elder |journal = British Medical Journal |date = 22 May 1943 |title = Aldous Huxley on Vision |pages = 635–36 |url = http://ukpmc.ac.uk/backend/ptpmcrender.cgi?accid=PMC2282772&amp;blobtype=pdf |format = PDF |pmc = 2282772 |volume = 1 |issue = 4298 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.4298.635-a }}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A [[cataract]] when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time. One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;
* Some studies have suggested that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight.&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster had this to say: "Since seeing is only partly a matter of the image on the retina and the sensation it produces, but is in still larger part a matter of the cerebral processes of synthesis, in which memories play a principal role, it follows that by repetition, by practice, by exercises, one builds up a substratum of memories useful for the interpretation of sensations and facilitates the syntheses which are the major part of seeing."&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite journal |journal = The Australasian Journal of Optometry |title = Present Status of Eye Exercise for Improvement of Visual Function |date = 31 October 1945 |first = Walter B |last = Lancaster |volume = 28 |issue = 10 |url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122274312/PDFSTART |format = PDF |pages = 449–80 |doi = 10.1111/j.1444-0938.1945.tb00209.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting the role of the brain in the process of seeing, "leaving to irregular, half-trained workers the cultivation of that field".&lt;ref name=Lancaster /&gt;
* A 1952 study involving 100 subjects claiming to experience "flashes" of clear vision, in which eyesight momentarily becomes much sharper, found only one subject who "demonstrated unusually good transient acuity (a flash) but she was unable to maintain it or repeat it for measurement of refraction" and concluded that "'flashers' (those who can obtain remarkably large transient increases in visual acuity) are uncommon".&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt; A 2004 study proposed that such flashes may be caused by "negative accommodation" (i.e. an active flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles).&lt;ref name=Raz2004a&gt;{{cite journal |last = Raz |first = A. |last2 = Marinoff |first2 = G.

L. |year = 2004 |title = Substrates of negative accommodation |journal = Binocular Vision &amp; Strabismus Quarterly |volume = 19 |issue = 2 |pages = 71–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 1982 study of subjects who underwent computer-based visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual acuity is best explained as a [[contact lens]]-like effect of moisture on the eye, based on increased tear action exhibited by 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement.&lt;ref name="AAO"&gt;{{cite web |date = August 2013 |url = http://www.aao.org/complimentary-therapy-assessment/visual-training-refractive-errors-cta--october-200 |publisher = American Academy of Ophthalmology |title = Complementary Therapy Assessments: Visual Training for Refractive Errors |accessdate = 20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2003 study of claims that "positive suggestion (e.g., using hypnosis) can significantly improve visual acuity" found that "neither suggestion nor hypnotic phenomena are likely to significantly improve myopic vision".&lt;ref name=Raz2004b&gt;{{cite journal |last = Raz |first = A. |last2 = Marinoff |first2 = G.

== General research ==
{{See also|Behavioral optometry|Vision therapy}}

In 2004 the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] (AAO) published a review of various research regarding "visual training",&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; which consisted of "eye exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback, eye patches, or eye massages", "alone or in combinations". No evidence was found that such techniques could [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] benefit eyesight, though some studies noted changes, both positive and negative, in the [[visual acuity]] of nearsighted subjects as measured by a [[Snellen chart]]. In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow-ups. However, these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness, and were attributed instead to factors such as "improvements in interpreting blurred images, changes in mood or motivation, creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes, or a pinhole effect from [[miosis]] of the pupil."&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt;

In 2005 the Ophthalmology Department of New Zealand's [[Christchurch Hospital]] published a review of forty-three studies regarding the use of [[eye exercises]]. They found that "As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises" to improve visual acuity, and concluded that "their use therefore remains controversial."&lt;ref name="Rawstron"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Rawstron |first = JA |last2 = Burley |first2 = CD |last3 = Elder |first3 = MJ |journal = Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus |year = 2005 |volume = 42 |issue = 2 |pages = 82–88 |title = A systematic review of the applicability and efficacy of eye exercises |pmid = 15825744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General criticisms ==

=== Dead-end ===

A frequent criticism of the Bates method is that it has remained relatively obscure, which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective. Writer Alan M. MacRobert concluded in a 1979 article that the "most telling argument against the Bates system" and other [[Alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] was that they "bore no fruit". In regards to the Bates method, he reasoned that "If palming, shifting, and swinging could really cure poor eyesight, glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse-drawn carriages."&lt;ref name=MacRobert&gt;{{cite news |date = 28 March 1979 |newspaper = [[San Diego Reader]] |first = Alan M. |last = MacRobert |url = http://www.skeptically.org/thinkersonreligion/id1.html |title = Hocus Focus: modern spiritualism }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corrective lenses and safety ===
Discarding one's corrective lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses weaker than one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially when one is operating a motor vehicle.&lt;ref name="Grierson" /&gt; [[James Randi]] related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses on the advice of Bates' book, wrecked his car.&lt;ref name='J.Randi Bates'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-11/111706rampa.html#i3 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110224220929/http://randi.org/jr/2006-11/111706rampa.html#i3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 February 2011 |title=Swift: the weekly newsletter of the JREF |accessdate=6 April 2009 |last=Randi |first=James |date=17 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.&lt;ref name="Grierson" /&gt;

=== Avoidance of conventional treatment ===

One of the greatest potential dangers of faith in the Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to [[Eye examination|seek medical advice]] regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name="Chou" /&gt; Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent [[amblyopia|lazy eye]]. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late.&lt;ref name="Grierson" /&gt; It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.&lt;ref name=Donahue&gt;{{cite journal |title = Prescribing Spectacles in Children: A Pediatric Ophthalmologist's Approach |last = Donahue |first = Sean P. |journal = Optometry and Vision Science |date = February 2007 |volume = 84 |pages = 110–14 |url = http://www.optvissci.com/pt/re/ovs/fulltext.00006324-200702000-00009.htm |doi = 10.1097/OPX.0b013e318031b09b |pmid = 17299340 |issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|450px|The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and the [[hierarchy of the sciences|hierarchy of the sciences]].]]

The '''branches of science''', also referred to as [[Science|sciences]], "scientific fields", or "scientific disciplines," are commonly divided into three major groups:

*'''[[Formal science|Formal sciences]]''': the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[fact]]ual, [[methodology]].
*'''[[Natural science]]s''': the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, chemical, and biological factors of the universe)
*'''[[Social science]]s''': the study of [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Social science|Social Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}

Natural and social sciences are [[empirical]] sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions.
{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} This verifiability may well vary even ''within'' a scientific discipline &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Davide Castelvecchi, Nature Magazine | date=2015-12-23 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/ | title=Is String Theory science? | publisher=Scientific American | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=2016-03-03 | url=https://www.nature.com/news/psychology-s-reproducibility-problem-is-exaggerated-say-psychologists-1.19498 | title=Psychology's reproducibility problem | publisher=Nature | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural, social, and formal science make up the [[fundamental science]]s, which form the basis of [[interdisciplinary]] and applied sciences such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.&lt;ref&gt;see: {{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural/Pure Science ==
{{Main article|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

Natural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].

=== Physical science ===
{{Main article|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}

Physical science is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.

==== Physics ====
{{Main article|Physics|Outline of physics}}

''Physics''(from {{lang-grc|φύσις|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]&lt;ref name = "feynman"&gt;
[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.

==== Chemistry ====
{{Main article|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}

''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed)&lt;ref&gt;'''See:''' [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]).

==== Earth science ====
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of earth science}}

''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.

===== Ecology=====
{{Main article|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}

Ecology (from Greek: οἶκος, "house"; -λογία, "study of") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].

===== Oceanography =====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}

Oceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that study of the ocean . It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux|fluxes]] of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].

===== Geology =====
{{Main article|Geology|Outline of geology}}

Geology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γῆ, gê, "earth" and λόγος, [[logos]], "study") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.

===== Meteorology=====
{{Main article|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}

Meteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.

==== Space Science or Astronomy ====
{{Main article|Space Science|Outline of space science}}

Space science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science – definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) – NASA Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).

=== Life science ===
{{Main article|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}

''Life science'' comprises the branches of science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a clearly biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of life science, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.

==== Biology ====
{{Main article|Biology|Outline of biology}}

''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.

===== Zoology =====
{{Main article|Zoology|Outline of zoology}} 

Zoology, occasionally spelled zoölogy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον (zōon, "animal") + λόγος (logos, "knowledge"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].

=====Human biology=====
{{main article|Human biology}}
Human biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.

Some branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].

===== Botany=====
{{Main article|Botany|Outline of botany}}

Botany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.
The term "botany" comes from Greek βοτάνη, meaning "pasture, grass, fodder", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.

== Social sciences ==
{{Main article|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}

The ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. "Social science" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] to refer to a plurality of fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[education]], [[government]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), [[public health]], [[ theology]], [[sociology]] and, in some contexts, [[geography]], [[history]] and [[law]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East-European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal sciences ==
{{Main article|Formal sciences|Outline of formal science}}

The ''formal sciences'' are the branches of science that are concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], [[statistics]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].

Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of [[Scientific theory|theories]] based on [[observation]]s in the [[Reality|real world]] ([[empirical knowledge]]), but rather with the properties of [[formal system]]s based on [[definition]]s and [[Rule of inference|rule]]s. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of [[scientific model]]s dealing with observable reality,{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79&amp;ndash;82}} and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

=== Decision theory ===
{{Main article|Decision theory}}

''Decision theory'' in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game law.

=== Logic ===
{{Main article|Logic|Outline of logic}}

''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:λογική|λογική]]'' logikē)&lt;ref&gt;"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", also related to ''[[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]]'' (logos), "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle" (Liddell &amp; Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].&lt;ref name=stanford-logic-onthology&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | chapterurl = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Logic is also studied in [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = J. Robert | editor1-last = Cox | editor2-first = Charles Arthur | editor2-last = Willard | editor2-link = Charles Arthur Willard | title = Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research | publisher = [[Southern Illinois University Press]] | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-8093-1050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{Main article|Mathematics|Outline of mathematics}}

''Mathematics'', first of all known as The Science of numbers which is classified in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB Marcus Tomalin (2006) ''Linguistics and the Formal Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedikt Löwe]] (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20117289 "The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity"]&lt;/ref&gt; has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}

=== Statistics ===
{{Main article|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}

''Statistics'' is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of [[data]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=statistics The Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

A [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

The word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose plural is ''statistics'' ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").

=== Systems theory ===
{{Main article|Systems theory}}

''Systems theory'' is the [[Interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from [[Ludwig con Albertan|Bernays]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GS) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Alcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Nickolas McLuhan]].

In this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate.

=== Theoretical computer science ===
{{Main article|Theoretical computer science}}

''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.

These divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.

== Applied sciences==
{{Main article|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}

''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.

Applied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.

Example fields of applied science include
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Applied physics]]
* [[Medicine]]
* [[Computer science]]

Fields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13074">[[File:Profbuteyko.jpg|thumbnail|Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko]]

The '''Buteyko method''' or '''Buteyko Breathing Technique''' is a form of [[Alternative medicine|complementary or alternative]] [[physiotherapy|physical therapy]] that proposes the use of breathing exercises primarily as a treatment for [[asthma]] and other respiratory conditions.&lt;ref name="aus17" /&gt; The method takes its name from Ukrainian doctor [[Konstantin Buteyko|Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko]], who first formulated its principles during the 1950s.  This method is based on the assumption that numerous medical conditions, including asthma, are caused by chronically increased [[respiratory rate]] or deeper breathing ([[hyperventilation]]).  However, this theory is not widely supported in the medical community due to the lack of evidence supporting either the theory behind the method or that it works in practice.  This method purportedly retrains the breathing pattern through chronic repetitive breathing exercises to correct the hyperventilation, which, according to the method's proponents, will therefore treat or cure asthma as well as any other conditions purportedly caused by hyperventilation.  At the core of the Buteyko method is a series of reduced-breathing exercises that focus on [[Pranayama#Forms|nasal-breathing]], [[Pranayama#Forms|breath-holding]] and [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]].

Opinion is divided on whether the Buteyko method confers any health benefits: some evidence suggests it may help alleviate [[asthma]] symptoms and improve quality of life.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sign/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; the Buteyko method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cochrane review]] had earlier found "no reliable conclusions" could be determined based on the limited available evidence.&lt;ref name=Freitas /&gt; A 2014 British [[clinical guideline]] said that for adults the Buteyko method could improve some asthma symptoms and quality of life, but that it had little impact on lung function.&lt;ref name=sign&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=British guideline on the management of asthma |journal=Thorax |volume=69 Suppl 1 |issue= |page=56 |year=2014 |pmid=25323740 |type=Practice guideline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the Buteyko method report a wide range of other diseases and symptoms (numbering up to 150), including [[diabetes]], reproductive disorders and psychological disorders, which they believe is aggravated by hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and therefore are treated by use of the Buteyko method.  However, research into the effectiveness of Buteyko have focused almost exclusively on asthma with a small amount of research on [[sleep apnea]].&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt; Members of the medical community have been skeptical of the efficacy of Buteyko due to the often "exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims" earlier made by Buteyko practitioners.&lt;ref name=Bruton2011/&gt;

There are few high quality studies such as [[randomized controlled trials]] looking at the efficacy of treating asthma with "breathing retraining" methods in general, which include the Buteyko method, [[yoga]] training and other relaxation techniques.&lt;ref name=Freitas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=DA|author2=Holloway, EA |author3=Bruno, SS |author4=Chaves, GS |author5=Fregonezi, GA |author6= Mendonça, KP |title=Breathing exercises for adults with asthma.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 1, 2013|volume=10|pages=CD001277|pmid=24085551|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd001277.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the studies that have evaluated breathing retraining have significant methodological flaws, including small [[sample size]]s,&lt;ref name=Ernst&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=Breathing techniques--adjunctive treatment modalities for asthma?

== History ==

The Buteyko method was originally developed in the 1950s by [[physiologist]] Konstantin Buteyko in Russia.&lt;ref name=Bruton2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruton A, Lewith GT |title=The Buteyko breathing technique for asthma: a review |journal=Complement Ther Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=41–6 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15907677 |doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2005.01.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official study into the effectiveness of the Buteyko Method on asthma was undertaken in 1968 at the Leningrad Institute of Pulmonology.  The second, held at the First Moscow Institute of Pediatric Diseases in April 1980, eventually led to the head of the ministry of health to issue an order (No 591) for the implementation of the Buteyko method in the treatment of bronchial asthma.&lt;ref name="BurenkovS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Burenkov S | title=Buteyko Method: The experience of implementation in medical practice | chapter=USSR Ministry of Health, Order No 591 | editor= Buteyko KP | publisher=Patriot Press | location=Moscow | year=1990 | pages=166–167 |isbn=5-7030-0456-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this method was introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, where it has received increasing exposure.&lt;ref name=Bruton2005/&gt; Anecdotal reports of life-changing improvements attributed to the Buteyko method abound on the Internet and in books.&lt;ref name=Courtney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Courtney|first=Rosalba|title=Strengths, Weaknesses, and Possibilities of the Buteyko Breathing Method|journal=Biofeedback|date=Summer 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=59–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buteyko method is just one of a number of breathing retraining methods in use for treating lung diseases, including conventional techniques such as [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]]-led breathing exercises as well as alternative medicine techniques such as Buteyko breathing and [[yoga]].&lt;ref name=Bruton2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruton A, Thomas M |title=The role of breathing training in asthma management |journal=Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=53–7 |date=February 2011 |pmid=21150439 |doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283423085 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

The Buteyko method is based on the concept that "hidden" or undiagnosed hyperventilation is the underlying cause of numerous medical conditions, including asthma.  It is known that hyperventilation can lead to low [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood (or [[hypocapnea]]), which can subsequently lead to disturbances of the [[acid-base]] balance in the blood and lower tissue [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygen levels]].  Advocates of this method believe that the effects of ''chronic'' hyperventilation would have even wider effects than is commonly accepted.&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt;  These effects include widespread spasms of the muscle in the airways ([[bronchospasm]]),&lt;ref name=BrutonChest&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruton A, Holgate ST |title=Hypocapnia and asthma: a mechanism for breathing retraining? |journal=Chest |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=1808–11 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15888863 |doi=10.1378/chest.127.5.1808 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; disturbance of cell energy production via the [[Krebs cycle]], as well as disturbance of numerous vital [[homeostatic]] chemical reactions in the body.  The Buteyko method is a purported method of "retraining" the body's breathing pattern to correct for the presumed ''chronic'' hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and thereby treat or cure the body of these medical problems.&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt;

The Buteyko method is not widely supported in the medical community, in part due to the fact that research has not supported this theory that hyperventilation and hypocapnea causes disease,&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt; with one review noting that there is no convincing evidence to indicate that trying to change asthmatic's carbon dioxide level is either "desirable or achievable."&lt;ref name=BrutonChest/&gt;  Studies that have looked for evidence to corroborate this theory, such as looking at the carbon dioxide levels in practitioners of Buteyko, have not found this evidence, leading some to propose alternate theoretical pathways for this method to improve symptoms.&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt;

== Description ==
Although variations exist among teachers of the technique in different countries, the main objective is "normalization" of breathing and the three core principles of Buteyko remain the same: nasal breathing, reduced breathing and relaxation.

=== Nasal breathing ===

The Buteyko method emphasizes the importance of nasal breathing, which protects the airways by humidifying, warming, and cleaning the air entering the lungs.  A majority of asthmatics have problems sleeping at night, and this is thought by Buteyko practitioners to be linked with poor posture or unconscious mouth-breathing. By keeping the nose clear and encouraging nasal breathing during the day, night-time symptoms can also improve.  Strictly nasal breathing during physical exercise is another key element of the Buteyko method.&lt;ref name="aus17" /&gt;

=== Reduced breathing exercises ===

The core Buteyko exercises involve breath control; consciously reducing either breathing rate or breathing volume.&lt;ref name="Breathe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Mike|last2=Bruton|first2=Anne|title=Breathing exercises for asthma|journal=Breathe|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=4|pages=313–322|doi=10.1183/20734735.008414|url=http://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/10/4/312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teachers refer to Buteyko as 'breathing retraining' and compare the method to learning to ride a bicycle. Once time has been spent practicing, the techniques become instinctive and the exercises are gradually phased out as the condition improves.

Buteyko uses a measurement called the Control Pause (CP), the amount of time between breaths that an individual can comfortably hold breath.&lt;ref name="Courtney" /&gt; According to Buteyko teachers, people with asthma who regularly practice Buteyko breathing will notice an increase in CP and decrease in pulse rate that corresponds to decreased asthma symptoms.

=== Relaxation ===

Dealing with asthma attacks is an important factor of Buteyko practice. The first feeling of an asthma attack is unsettling and can result in a short period of rapid breathing. By controlling this initial over-breathing phase, asthmatics can prevent a "vicious circle of over-breathing" from developing and spiraling into an asthma attack. This theory asserts that asthma attacks may be averted simply by breathing less.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">The '''Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network''' (CFBLNet) is a laboratory environment which utilizes a distributed [[Wide area network|Wide Area Network]] (WAN) as the vehicle to simulate training environments and to de-risk [[command and control]] (C2) and [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] capabilities by conducting [[Research and development|Research and Development]], Training, Trials and Assessment (RDTT&amp;A) on command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) initiatives and training events. Since 2001, membership has been established and represented by three core parties: the U.S. Joint Staff, the Combined Communications and Electronics Board (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States), and the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (including NATO agencies and 29 member nations, not all of which actively participate). Besides the core parties to the CFBLNet Technical Arrangement, four nations (Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland) have become Guest Mission Partners under rules contained in CFBLNet governance documentation referred to as Publication 1.

CFBLNet provides the main platform for conducting Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation (CIAV) events in the context of [[Federated Mission Networking]].

== Network Structure ==
The CFBLNet consists of a distributed and integrated [[network architecture]] of combined, joint, and military service infrastructure components (networks, database servers, application servers, client workstations, etc.). These strings of network equipment and services are located within the confines of the various national and international battle laboratories and experimentation sites of the participants, which provide the applications, analytic tools, and communications necessary to conduct initiatives or experiments.

No single nation owns the CFBLNet infrastructure; each member nation is responsible for the funding and maintenance of its own systems and CFBL network segments, which hook into the backbone at a defined Point-of-Presence (POP). All CFBLNet members must respect the [[sovereignty]] and [[intellectual property]] of the other nations. Also, each country is responsible for funding its own experiments. The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) &lt;ref&gt;DISA.mil: [http://www.disa.mil/mnis/ Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Fort Meade, Maryland (USA) maintains day-to-day control of the network and coordinates activities on the network. 

The U.S. CFBLNet infrastructure is extensive and reaches to international demarcation points for the Southern Hemisphere and Europe. Nations and organizations within nations which are not a part of the Technical Agreement must be sponsored to become a Guest CFBLNet Mission Partner (GMP) by a charter member, Core CFBLNet Mission Partner (CMP), to sponsor initiatives and to connect to the CFBLNet.

== History ==
The CFBLNet grew out the network designed to support the U.S. Joint Warfighter Interoperability Demonstrations (JWID), which used to build a support network for the period of the demonstrations and tear it down each year after the demonstrations. In 1999, the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration/Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID/JWID) exercise used, for the first time, a permanent infrastructure that became what is now called the Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet), as established by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board (NC3B) in 2001. The formal Technical Agreement (or charter) was signed in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/5742329/UNCLASSIFIED-COMBINED-FEDERATED-BATTLE-LABORATORY-NETWORK-CFBLNET-ANNUAL-REPORT CFBLNet 2006 Annual Report], page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Discovery science" (also known as '''discovery-based science''') is a [[scientific method]]ology which emphasizes analysis of large volumes of [[experimental data]] with the goal of finding new [[pattern]]s or [[correlation]]s, leading to [[hypothesis]] formation and other scientific methodologies.

Discovery-based methodologies are often viewed in contrast to traditional scientific practice, where hypotheses are formed before close examination of experimental data. However, from a philosophical perspective where all or most of the observable "[[low hanging fruit]]" has already been plucked, examining the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] world more closely than the senses alone (even augmented senses, e.g. via [[microscope]]s, [[telescope]]s, bifocals etc.) opens a new source of knowledge for hypothesis formation. This process is also known as [[inductive reasoning]] or the use of specific observations to make generalizations.

[[Data mining]] is the most common tool used in discovery science, and is applied to data from diverse fields of study such as [[DNA microarray|DNA analysis]], [[climate model]]ing, [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear reaction modeling]], and others.

The use of data mining in discovery science follows a general trend of increasing use of computers and [[computational theory]] in all fields of science. Further following this trend, the cutting edge of data mining employs specialized [[machine learning]] algorithms for automated hypothesis forming and [[automated theorem proving]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6658">'''Dual-polarization interferometry''' ('''DPI''') is an analytical technique that probes molecular layers adsorbed to the surface of a [[Waveguide (optics)|waveguide]] using the [[evanescent wave]] of a [[laser]] beam. It is used to measure the [[conformational change]] in proteins, or other biomolecules, as they function (referred to as the [[conformation activity relationship]]).

==Instrumentation==
DPI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cross |first1=G |last2=Reeves |first2=AA |last3=Brand |first3=S |last4=Popplewell |first4=JF |last5=Peel |first5=LL |last6=Swann |first6=MJ |last7=Freeman |first7=NJ |year=2003 |title=A new quantitative optical biosensor for protein characterisation |journal=[[Biosensors and Bioelectronics]] |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=383–90 |pmid=14615097 |doi=10.1016/S0956-5663(03)00203-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses laser light into two waveguides. One of these functions as the "sensing" waveguide having an exposed surface while the second one functions to maintain a reference beam. A two-dimensional [[interference pattern]] is formed in the far field by combining the light passing through the two waveguides. The DPI technique rotates the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the laser, to alternately excite two polarization modes of the waveguides. Measurement of the interferogram for both polarizations allows both the [[refractive index]] and the thickness of the adsorbed layer to be calculated. The polarization can be switched rapidly, allowing real-time measurements of [[chemical reaction]]s taking place on a chip [[surface chemistry|surface]] in a flow-through system. These measurements can be used to infer conformational information about the [[molecular interaction]]s taking place, as the molecule size (from the layer thickness) and the fold density (from the RI) change. DPI is typically used to characterize [[biochemical]] interactions by quantifying any [[conformational change]] at the same time as measuring reaction rates, affinities and thermodynamics.

The technique is quantitative and real-time (10&amp;nbsp;Hz) with a dimensional resolution of 0.01&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swann |first=MJ |last2=Freeman |first2=NJ |last3=Cross |first3=GH |year=2007 |chapter=Dual Polarization Interferometry: A Real-Time Optical Technique for Measuring (Bio)Molecular Orientation, Structure and Function at the Solid/Liquid Interface |editor=Marks, R.S. |editor2=Lowe, C.R. |editor3=Cullen, D.C. |editor4=Weetall, H.H. |editor5=Karube, I. |title=Handbook of Biosensors and Biochips |volume=Vol. 1 |issue= |at=Pt.&amp;nbsp;4, Ch.&amp;nbsp;33, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–568 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |isbn=978-0-470-01905-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A novel application for dual-polarization interferometry emerged in 2008, where the intensity of light passing through the waveguide is extinguished in the presence of crystal growth. This has allowed the very earliest stages in protein crystal nucleation to be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boudjemline |first1=A |last2=Clarke |first2=DT |last3=Freeman |first3=NJ |last4=Nicholson |first4=JM |last5=Jones |first5=GR |year=2008 |title=Early stages of protein crystallization as revealed by emerging optical waveguide technology |journal=[[Journal of Applied Crystallography]] |volume=41 |page=523 |doi=10.1107/S0021889808005098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of dual-polarization interferometers also have the capability to quantify the order and disruption in birefringent thin films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mashaghi |first1=A |last2=Swann |first2=M |last3=Popplewell |first3=J |last4=Textor |first4=M |last5=Reimhult |first5=E |year=2008 |title=Optical Anisotropy of Supported Lipid Structures Probed by Waveguide Spectroscopy and Its Application to Study of Supported Lipid Bilayer Formation Kinetics |journal=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]] |volume=80 |issue=10 |pages=3666–76 |doi=10.1021/ac800027s |pmid=18422336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used, for example, to study the formation of lipid bilayers and their interaction with membrane proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanghera |first1=N |last2=Swann |first2=MJ |last3=Ronan |first3=G |last4=Pinheiro |first4=TJ |year=2009 |title=Insight into early events in the aggregation of the prion protein on lipid membranes |journal=[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]] |volume=1788 |issue=10 |pages=2245–51 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2009.08.005 |pmid=19703409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=TH |last2=Heng |first2=C |last3=Swann |first3=MJ |last4=Gehman |first4=JD |last5=Separovic |first5=F |last6=Aguilar |first6=MI |year=2010 |title=Real-time quantitative analysis of lipid disordering by aurein 1.2 during membrane adsorption, destabilisation and lysis |journal=[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]] |volume=1798 |issue=10 |pages=1977–86 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.06.023 |pmid=20599687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:El Peru Cover Page.jpg|thumb|Title page of a 1929 edition of ''El Perú'']]

'''''El Perú: Itinerarios de Viajes''''' is an expansive written work covering a variety of topics in the [[natural history]] of [[Peru]], written by the prominent Italian-born Peruvian geographer and scientist [[Antonio Raimondi]] in the latter half of the 19th century.  The work was compiled from extensive and detailed notes Raimondi took while criss-crossing the country, studying the nation's geography, geology, meteorology, botany, zoology, ethnography, and archaeology; ''El Perú'' focuses to some extent on each of these topics and others.  The first volume was published in 1874; several more volumes were published both before Raimondi's death and posthumously from his notes, the last being released in 1913, making a five volume set.  The volumes are a classic example of exploration scholarship, and form one of the earliest and broadest scientific reviews of Peru's natural and cultural heritage.

[[File:Fotografi av Conte Mattei - Hallwylska museet - 103008.tif|thumb|Count Cesare Mattei]]
'''Electrohomoeopathy''' (or '''Mattei cancer cure''') is a derivative of [[homeopathy]] invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of ''electro'' (referring to an electric [[energy (esotericism)|bio-energy]] content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than [[electricity]] in its conventional sense) and ''homeopathy'' (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturowatch.org/hx/fishbein.html|title=Naturopathy and Its Professors (1932)|work=naturowatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucrative for its inventor and popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomoeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy". Like all homeopathy, it is regarded by the [[modern medicine|medical]] and [[scientific community|scientific communities]] as [[pseudoscience]] and its practice as [[quackery]].

==History and criticism==
Electrohomeopathy was devised by Cesare Mattei (1809–1896) in the latter part of the 19th century. Mattei, a nobleman living in a castle in the vicinity of [[Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaplease.it/eng/megazine/giroditalia/rocchetta|title=Arabian Nights in the Apennines|work=italiaplease.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied natural science, anatomy, physiology, pathology, chemistry and botany. He ultimately focused on the supposed therapeutic power of "electricity" in botanical extracts. Mattei made bold, unsupported claims for the efficacy of his treatments, including the claim that his treatments offered a nonsurgical alternative to [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciper.org/print/RR1-3-1-3.html|title=Science in the 19th Century Periodical|work=sciper.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment regimens were met with scepticism by mainstream medicine:&lt;blockquote&gt;The electrohomeopathic system is an invention of Count Mattei who prates of "red", "yellow" and "blue", "green" and "white" electricity, a theory that, in spite of its utter idiocy, has attracted a considerable following and earned a large fortune for its chief promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692368|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=3|issue=4|pages=231–48|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|pmid=18340885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notwithstanding criticisms, including a challenge by the British medical establishment to the claimed success of his cancer treatments,&lt;ref&gt;GW Potter, "Matteism: An Exposure", ''[[British Medical Journal|British Med J]]'', 13 August 1892&lt;/ref&gt; electrohomeopathy (or Matteism, as it was sometimes known at the time) had adherents in Germany, France, the USA and the UK by the beginning of the 20th century; electrohomeopathy had been the subject of approximately 100 publications and there were three journals dedicated to it.&lt;ref name=baylen&gt;{{cite journal
|first=J. O
|last=Baylen
|title=The Mattei cancer cure: a Victorian nostrum
|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society
|year=1969
|volume=7
|issue=169
|page=397
|jstor=1624730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Remedies are derived from what are said to be the active micro nutrients or mineral salts of certain plants. One contemporary account of the process of producing electrohomeopathic remedies was as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the nature of his remedies we learn ... that ... they are manufactured from certain herbs, and that the directions for the preparation of the necessary dilutions are given in the ordinary jargon of homeopathy. The globules and liquids, however, are "instinct with a potent, vital, electrical force, which enables them to work wonders". This process of "fixing the electrical principle" is carried on in the secret central chamber of a Neo-[[Moorish]] castle which Count Mattei has built for himself in the Bolognese [[Apennines]] ... The "red electricity" and "white electricity" supposed to be "fixed" in these "vegetable compounds" are in their very nomenclature and suggestion poor and miserable fictions.&lt;ref&gt;The Mattei Fable, ''British Med J'' Jan 17, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mattei's own ideas however, every disease originates in the change of [[blood]] or of the [[lymphatic system]] or both, and remedies can therefore be mainly divided into two broad categories to be used in response to the dominant affected system. Mattei wrote that having obtained plant extracts, he was "able to determine in the liquid vegetable electricity". Allied to his theories and therapies were elements of Chinese medicine, of medical [[humours]], of apparent Brownianism, as well as modified versions of [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s homeopathic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Lodispoto, 'L'Electromiopathie du Comte Cesare Mattei', ''Zeitschrift für Klassische Homöopathie'' (English abstract) 1971; 15: 130-135&lt;/ref&gt; Electrohomeopathy has some associations with [[Spagyric medicine]], a [[holistic]] medical philosophy claimed to be the practical application of alchemy in medical treatment, so that the principle of modern electrohomeopathy is that disease is typically multi-organic in cause or effect and therefore requires holistic treatment that is at once both complex and natural.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Modern usage==
A symposium took place in Bologna in 2008 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Cesare Mattei,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesaremattei.com cesaremattei.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with attendees from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Germany]], UK, and the USA. Electrohomeopathy is practiced predominantly in India and Pakistan (RAJYA SABHA Parliamentary Bulletin- The Recognition of Electro Homeopathy System of Medicine Bill,
2015 by E. M. Sudarsana Natchiappan, M. P),&lt;ref&gt;The Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Research Desk) orders no. R14015/25/96-U&amp;H (R) (Pt.), 25 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but there are also a number of electrohomeopathy organizations and institutions worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

An '''ergonomic glove''', also known as a '''computer glove''' or '''support glove''', is a stiff glove worn to prevent or remedy [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] by holding the wrist in a certain position while typing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,,t=&amp;i=42721,00.asp |title=ergonomic glove |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work=PC Magazine Encyclopedia |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous types of ergonomic gloves that vary in design in multiple ways including in their firmness, whether they cover the fingers completely, and if they are intended for heavier physical use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ergonomicallyspeaking.net/what-are-ergonomic-gloves/ |title=What are ergonomic gloves? |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ergonomic glove design covers many fields with even the gloves worn by healthcare professionals becoming ergonomically designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microflex.com/xceed/comfort.html |title=Certified exam gloves |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faraday's laws of electrolysis''' are quantitative relationships based on the electrochemical researches published by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ehl, Rosemary Gene |author2=Ihde, Aaron | title = Faraday's Electrochemical Laws and the Determination of Equivalent Weights | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | year = 1954 | volume = 31 | issue = May | pages = 226&amp;ndash;232 | doi = 10.1021/ed031p226 | bibcode=1954JChEd..31..226E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Mathematical form==

Faraday's laws can be summarized by

:&lt;math&gt;m \ = \ \left({ Q \over F }\right)\left({ M \over z }\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''m'' is the mass of the substance liberated at an electrode in gms
* ''Q'' is the total electric charge passed through the substance in coulombs
* ''F'' = 96485.33289(59) C mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Faraday constant]]
* ''M'' is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mol
* ''z'' is the valency number of [[ion]]s of the substance (electrons transferred per ion).

Note that ''M/z'' is the same as the [[equivalent weight]] of the substance altered.

For Faraday's first law, ''M'', ''F'', and ''z'' are constants, so that the larger the value of ''Q'' the larger m will be.

For Faraday's second law, ''Q'', ''F'', and ''z'' are constants, so that the larger the value of ''M/z'' (equivalent weight) the larger m will be.

In the simple case of constant-[[electric current|current]] electrolysis, &lt;math&gt; Q = I t &lt;/math&gt; leading to

:&lt;math&gt;m \ = \ \left({ I t\over F }\right)\left({ M \over z }\right) &lt;/math&gt;

and then to

:&lt;math&gt;n \ = \ \left({ I t\over F }\right)\left({ 1 \over z }\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''n'' is the [[amount of substance]] ("number of moles") liberated: ''n  = m/M''
* ''t'' is the total time the constant current was applied.

In the more complicated case of a variable electric current, the total charge ''Q'' is the electric current ''I''(''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;'') integrated over time ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \int_0^t I(\tau) \ d \tau &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''t'' is the ''total'' electrolysis time.&lt;ref&gt;For a similar treatment, see {{cite journal | author = Strong, F. C. | title = Faraday's Laws in One Equation | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | year = 1961 | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 98 | doi = 10.1021/ed038p98 |bibcode = 1961JChEd..38...98S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Reynolds, A discourse upon prodigious abstinence... Wellcome L0022587.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1669 report that claims a woman fasted for 12 months]]
'''Inedia''' (Latin for "[[fasting]]") or '''breatharianism''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|θ|ˈ|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming [[food]]. Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases [[water]], are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by ''[[prana]]'', the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of ''prana'', and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

Breatharianism is considered a deadly [[pseudoscience]] by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation and dehydration. Though it is common knowledge that biological entities require sustenance to survive, breatharianism continues.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news

==Scientific assessment==
[[Nutrition]]al science proves that [[fasting]] for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death. In the absence of food intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle. Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |title=Can humans survive on air alone? | publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |accessdate=2009-07-30 |first=Katie|last=Lambert|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226084504/http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |archivedate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioners==

===Rosicrucianism===
The 1670 [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'' attributed the practice to the physician and occultist [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) who was described as having lived "several years by taking only one half scrupule of Solar Quintessence". In this book, it is also stated that, "Paracelsus affirms that He has seen many of the Sages fast twenty years without eating anything whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=abbé de Nicolas-Pierre-Henri|first1=Villars|title=Comte de Gabalis|publisher=The Brothers|pages=63–64|edition=1914|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028957467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ram Bahadur Bomjon ("Bakji")===
[[Ram Bahadur Bomjon]] is a young Nepalese Buddhist monk who lives as an ascetic in a remote area of Nepal.  Bomjon appears to go for periods of time without ingesting either food or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 20 March 2006 |title = Nepalese Buddha Boy 'reappears' |work = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paldendorje.com/en/ |title=paldendorje.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917203905/http://paldendorje.com/en/ |archivedate=17 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such period was chronicled in a 2006 Discovery Channel documentary titled ''The Boy With Divine Powers'', which reported that Bomjon neither moved, ate, nor drank anything during 96 hours of filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/TheBoyWithDivinePowers | title=The Boy With Divine Powers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prahlad Jani ("Mataji")===
[[Prahlad Jani]] is an Indian [[sadhu]] who says he has lived without food and water for more than 70 years. His claims were investigated by doctors at Sterling Hospital, [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]] in 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Dasgupta-Hindu"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |title = The Hindu – DIPAS concludes observational study on ‘Mataji' |accessdate =15 June 2010 |author = Manas Dasgupta | date= 9 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231214130/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |archivedate=2015-12-31 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that Prahlad Jani was able to survive under observation for two weeks without either food or water, and had passed no [[urine]] or [[feces|stool]],&lt;ref name="Khanna-bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |title = Fasting fakir flummoxes physicians |accessdate =7 June 2008 |author = Rajeev Khanna | date=25 November 2003 |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328154126/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |archivedate=2016-03-28 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no need for [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |title=Scientists Baffled by Prahlad Jani, Man Who Doesn't Eat or Drink |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173223/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with the researchers speak of strict observation and relate that round-the-clock observation was ensured by multiple [[CCTV]] cameras. Jani was subjected to multiple medical tests,&lt;ref name=DNAIndia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_experts-baffled-as-mataji-s-medical-reports-are-normal_1380169 |title=Experts baffled as Mataji's medical reports are normal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132105/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_experts-baffled-as-mataji-s-medical-reports-are-normal_1380169 |archivedate=2013-01-28 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his only contact with any form of fluid was during bathing and gargling, with the fluid spat out measured by the doctors.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt; The research team could not comment on his claim of having been able to survive in this way for decades.

The case has attracted criticism, both after the 2003 tests and the 2010 tests. [[Sanal Edamaruku]], president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], criticized the 2010 experiment for allowing Jani to move out of a certain CCTV camera's field of view, meet devotees and leave the sealed test room to sunbathe. Edamaruku stated that the regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored, and accused Jani of having had some "influential protectors" who denied Edamaruku permission to inspect the project during its operation.&lt;ref name="rationalistinternational1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edamaruku |first=Sanal |url=http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |title=Prahlad Jani and his powerful protectors |publisher=Rationalistinternational.net |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165946/http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She said "I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice, and Sustainability,|author=Keith, L.|isbn=9781604861822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=\_KGWcPH41qYC|year=2009|publisher=PM Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp |archivedate=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001044/http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen stated that she found it difficult on the third day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. "I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe," she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat where her condition continued to deteriorate. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caic.org.au/miscult/breatharians/Fresh-air%20dietician%20fails%20TV%20show%27s%20challenge.htm | title=Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date=25 October 1999 | accessdate =7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was "quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%". Towards the end of the test, she said, "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now." The test was stopped. Wink said, "Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health."&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"/&gt; Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, "Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem."&lt;ref name="Bergman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=Gregory|title=Isms: From Autoeroticism to Zoroastrianism – an Irreverent Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUVuSNM5QUQC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2006|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-1788-6|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | work = The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209101343/http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmuheen was awarded the [[Bent Spoon Award]] by [[Australian Skeptics]] in 2000 ("presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |title = Bent Spoon 2000 – Winner (Jasmuheen) |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050616014356/http://skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |archivedate= 2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature for ''Living on Light''. Jasmuheen claims that their beliefs are based on the writings and "more recent [[channelling (mediumistic)|channelled]] material" from [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm | date = 22 September 1999 |title = All they need is the air | work = BBC News | accessdate =11 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305092336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm |archivedate=2016-03-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that some people's [[DNA]] has expanded from 2 to 12 strands, to "absorb more hydrogen". When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance as she was not referring to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |title = Correx Archives&amp;nbsp;– Jasmuheen | work = Corex | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =7 June 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980423153006/http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=1998-04-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary ''[[No Way to Heaven]]'' the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing on Jasmuheen's books, living for several years without food. The documentary also describes two attempts at scientific verification of his claims.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} {{asof|2017}}, five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism as a result of Jasmuheen's publications.&lt;ref name="3Deaths"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Walker |author2=Judith O'Reilly | title = Three deaths linked to 'living on air' cult | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | publisher = (London) | date = 26 September 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swiss woman starves to death on daylight diet |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/swiss-woman-starved-to-death-on-daylight-diet/story-e6frf7lf-1226339082591 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012}} "This was the fourth known death linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's books since the practice emerged in the early 90s."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contactmuziek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | title=Contact &amp; Muziek: Lichtvoeding | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612223030/http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | archive-date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/06/12/om-onderzoekt-sterfgeval-in-woongroep-die-voeding-afzweert-a1562695 | title=OM onderzoekt sterfgeval in woongroep die voeding afzweert | newspaper = NRC Handelsblad | location = Amsterdam | last = van der Veen | first = Casper | date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Wiley Brooks===
Wiley Brooks is the founder of the Breatharian Institute of America. He was first introduced to the public in 1980 when he appeared on the TV show ''[[That's Incredible!]]''.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 | title = Living On Light, Air – 'Breatharian' Says Food Is Poison But Pops An Occasional Twinkie | publisher = Seattle Times | last = Broom | first = Jack | date = 5 October 1993 | accessdate =12 February 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181311/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks stopped teaching recently{{when|date=October 2016}} to "devote 100% of his time on solving the problem as to why he needed to eat some type of food to keep his [[physical body]] alive and allow his [[Subtle body|light body]] to manifest completely."&lt;ref name="altinate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211031744/http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archivedate=11 February 2006 |title=Wiley Brooks website through Internet Archive |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brooks claims to have found "four major deterrents" which prevented him from living without food: "people pollution", "food pollution", "air pollution" and "electro pollution".&lt;ref name="altinate"/&gt;

In 1983 he was reportedly observed leaving a [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] [[7-Eleven]] with a [[Slurpee]], a [[hot dog]], and [[Twinkie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=John Yewell |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |title = A Year of Nüz|work=MetroActive News &amp; Issues  |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003042829/http://metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |archivedate=2000-10-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''[[Colors (magazine)|Colors]]'' magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a [[cheeseburger]] and a [[cola]], explaining that when he's surrounded by junk culture and [[junk food]], consuming them adds balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |title=sonoma papers |publisher=Metroactive.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306103945/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |archivedate=2003-03-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiley Brooks later claimed that [[Diet Coke]] and [[McDonald's]] cheeseburgers have special "5D" properties.  The idea of separate but interconnected 5D and 3D worlds is a major part of Wiley Brooks' ideology, and Wiley Brooks encourages his followers to only eat these special 5D foods, as well as meditate on a set of magical 5D words.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140522195834/http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Maor===
In a television documentary produced by the Israeli television [[Investigative journalism|investigative show]] ''The Real Face'' (פנים אמיתיות) hosted by [[Amnon Levy]], [[Israel]]i practitioner of Inedia Ray Maor (ריי מאור) who appeared to survive without food or water for eight days and eight nights. According to the documentary, he was restricted to a small villa and placed under constant video surveillance, with medical supervision that included daily blood testing. The documentary claimed Maor was in good spirits throughout the experiment, lost 17&amp;nbsp;lb after eight days, blood tests showed no change before, during or after the experiment, and [[Cardiologist]] Ilan Kitsis from [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]] was "baffled."&lt;ref name="panim.nana10.co.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glz.co.il"/&gt;

==Religious traditions==

===Christianity===
* ''[[Anorexia mirabilis]]''

===Hinduism===
Hindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around [[Rama]] when he came to [[Śarabhanga]]'s hermitage. These included, among others, the "...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give" and "those ... whose food the wave of air supplies". In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named [[Māṇḍakarṇi]] is mentioned: "For he, great votarist, intent – On strictest rule his stern life spent – ... – Ten thousand years on air he fed..."  (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, Hari [[Giri Bala]] and [[Therese Neumann]].

There are claims that [[Devraha Baba]] lived without food.

'''Ion Reactor''', is an invention by a British scientist.

==History==
In 2011, Dr Christopher Strevens (an inventor from London) began posting a website with instructions of how to build his "fusion reactor", which he says: "Creates helium from hydrogen. It also captures the power given off during the reaction as electrical power." He also posted several videos to YouTube showing his prototype in operation, and showing the different color of gas from before versus after; as well as showing spectral analysis that indicates that the hydrogen that he puts into the system has transmuted to helium—a nuclear phenomenon.

He said: "I found that when I increased the exciter power to 800 Watts, the output rose to 2,000 Watts [2.5-times overunity], and when I isolated the reactor from the exciter, this power remained. The spark gap regulator became active, keeping the power at this level. I only allowed this for a short time before reconnecting the exciter and turning the power down and the reaction ceased."

Because of the experiment being dangerous it would require a special paramagnetic ceramic bottle glazed inside to contain hydrogen ions and use the magnetic field of the coils and induction of ion fields to make a magnetic bottle to confine the ion reactions.

A brief description of the device, being a hydrogen tube wrapped with high voltage coils and a sort of energizing coil being similar to a high voltage [[tesla coil]] for the ionizer. The device having been made in a clear glass tube in early experiments uses induction to ionize the gases and the field made by ionized gases to energize ion tube coils.

The effect is similar to pyroelectric fusion but instead of pyroelectric crystals stripping the electrons from hydrogen atoms it is a high voltage induced electromagnetic field of coils and electrostatic induction of the ionized gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Christopher_Strevens_Nuclear_Reactor|title=Directory:Christopher Strevens Nuclear Reactor|work=peswiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The turning point came in 1989, when Irving launched Fred Leuchter's pseudo-scientific Leuchter Report, which made the spurious claim that the absence of cyanide residues in the walls of the gas chambers at Auschwitz and other camps proved that they could not have functioned as mass extermination centres."

*"Another common tactic of the deniers is to engage in historical inquiries that on the surface appear legitimate but upon close examination prove to be based on pseudo-science. One prominent example was the investigation of the Auschwitz gas chambers by [[Fred Leuchter]] [...].

*"Leuchter's report contained a considerable amount of scientific, or, as it turned out, pseudo-scientific analysis of chemical residues on the gas chamber walls, and similar matters. It was quickly discredited, not least on the basis of Leuchter's failure adequately to defend his findings on the witness stand." Evans, Richard J. ''David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition'', Section 3.3c, [http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/330c.html The 1991 Edition of ''Hitler's War''], Paragraph 13. Retrieved on 2008-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt; document authored by American [[Capital punishment|execution]] technician [[Fred A. Leuchter]], who was commissioned by [[Ernst Zündel]] to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing [[Holocaust denial]] material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal [[gas chamber|gassings]] at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, specifically at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.

Leuchter cited the absence of [[Prussian blue]] in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based [[cyanide]] compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations, in accordance with where and how it was used in [[the Holocaust]]. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Background==
In 1985, [[Ernst Zündel]], a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]'s Holocaust denial pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'', which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Zündel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.

Zündel and his lawyers were joined by [[Robert Faurisson]], a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt&gt;[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&amp;mdash;The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory''. Free Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-02-919235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} He was joined by [[David Irving]], an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defence and testify on Zündel's behalf.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Zündel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Zündel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Zündel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them "every step of the way" in spirit.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}}

After arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp site, and another at the former [[Majdanek]] concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materials&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}from the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | accessdate = 2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}

==Report==
The compiled report was published in Canada as ''The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland'', by Zündel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as ''Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz'' by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

Before Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:

{{Quote|text=THE COURT: How do you function as an engineer if you don't have an engineering degree?

THE WITNESS: Well, I would question, Your Honour, what an engineering degree is. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and I have the required background training both on the college level and in the field to perform my function as an engineer.

THE COURT: Who determines that? You?

|sign=Exchange between Leuchter and Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 8973.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

Leuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. [[Boston University]] actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Judge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as "ridiculous" and "preposterous", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on "second-hand information", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of "no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:

{{Quote|text=His opinion on this report is that there were never any gassings or there was never any exterminations carried on in this facility. As far as I am concerned, from what I've heard, he is not capable of giving that opinion....He is not in a position to say, as he said so sweepingly in this report, what could not have been carried on in these facilities.|sign=Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 9049-9050.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}}}

When questioned on the functioning of the crematoria, the judge also prevented Leuchter from testifying because "he hasn't any expertise".&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Leuchter also claimed that consultation relating to [[sodium cyanide]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]] with [[DuPont]] was "an on-going thing". DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had "never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter", and had "never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek."&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}

==Claims and criticism==
The contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

===Prussian blue===
Leuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} While both facilities were exposed to the same substance ([[Zyklon B]]), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers.&lt;ref name="ironblues"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by [[Germar Rudolf]].

According to [[Richard J. Green]]:

{{Quote|text=In order for Leuchter or Rudolf to demonstrate the significance of their findings, it is necessary for them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal gas chambers were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal gas chambers do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;}}

In other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place—meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumbnail|Gas chamber in [[Majdanek concentration camp]] with blue residue]]
The problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Chemistry is Not the Science: Rudolf, Rhetoric, and Reduction|accessdate=2008-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152626/http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|archivedate=2008-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is [[pH]]. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

Since the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as "disingenuous".&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

====Polish follow-up investigation====
In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Kraków conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945,&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/introduction.html|title=Cracow (Post-Leuchter) Report|last=Markiewicz|first=Jan|date=|work=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz &amp; Birkenau Concentration Camps|publisher=Institute of Forensic Research|location=Cracow|access-date=|via=|author2=Gubala, Wojciech|author3=Labedz, Jerzy|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Introduction}} Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;

Leuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of [[fumigation]]. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.&lt;ref name=IFRC/&gt;{{rp|Final Remarks}}

[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]
Accordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of [[Block 11]] and the delousing facilities.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible,&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition).&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; The historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.&lt;ref name=confirm&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''Telling Lies about Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial''. Verso, 2002, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
By order of Heinrich Himmler, the crematoria and gas chambers at Birkenau were destroyed by the SS in order to hide evidence of genocide.&lt;ref name=Anatomy563&gt;Karny, Miroslav "The Vrba and Wetzler Report" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', [[Indiana University Press]], 1994; this edition 1998, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more than the bases of Crematoria IV and V can be seen: the floor plans of both facilities are indicated by bricks laid out across the concrete foundations,&lt;ref name=tests&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdot.org/learning/myth-fact/leuchter//body/1037|title=HDOT: Learning Tools : Myth/Fact Sheets : Scientific tests prove the "Gas Chambers" never existed|publisher=HDOT.org|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crematoria II and III are in ruins. Professor [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] labels Leuchter's comment that the facilities have not changed at all since 1942 or 1941 as "nonsense".&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

====Zyklon B====
Because hydrogen cyanide is explosive, Leuchter maintained that the gas chambers could never have been operated due to their proximity to the ovens of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|168}} It is correct that hydrogen cyanide is explosive, but only at concentrations of 56,000 ppm and above&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/74908.html|title=Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLHs) - 74908|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; over 186 times more than the lethal dose of 300 ppm. Critics estimate conservatively that within 5 to 15 minutes, gas chamber victims were exposed to 450 &amp;ndash; 1810 ppmv&lt;ref name=science/&gt; &amp;ndash; again considerably lower than the [[Flammability limit|lower explosion limit]].

====Gas chamber ventilation====
{{quote|If Leuchter had gone to the archives, if he had spent time in the archives, he would've found evidence about ventilation systems, evidence about ways to introduce Zyklon B into these buildings, evidence of gas chambers, undressing rooms.|Robert Jan van Pelt|''The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter''&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;}}
[[File:Auschwitz - Crematorium II gas chamber cross-section.jpg|thumb|right|Nazi blueprints of the Crematorium II gas chamber, labeled, ''Leichenkeller'' or "[[Mortuary|corpse cellar]]". A cross section view of the width of the room shows the ventilation channels that straddle the building along its longitudinal axis, marked ''Belüftung'' (aeration) and ''Entlüftungskanal'' (de-aeration channel).]]
Leuchter incorrectly assumed that the gas chambers were not ventilated.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix&gt;[http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix HDOT: Irving v. Lipstadt : Defense Documents : [The Van Pelt Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302004021/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix |date=2009-03-02 }}: Electronic Edition - IX The Leuchter Report&lt;/ref&gt; The basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure&lt;ref name=Anatomy166&gt;Piper, Franciszek, "Gas Chambers and Crematoria" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; capable of extracting the remaining gas and renewing the air every three to four minutes.&lt;ref name=Anatomy232&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude and Van Pelt, Robert-Jan "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ventilation was not used such as in Crematoria IV and V (although a ventilation system was later installed in Crematorium V in May 1944&lt;ref name=Anatomy238&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude and Van Pelt, Robert-Jan "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Sonderkommando]] prisoners wore gas masks when removing the bodies.&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; When presented in court with a document by the chief Auschwitz architect SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Karl Bischoff]], Leuchter misconstrued aeration (''Belüftung'') and ventilation (''Entlüftung'') as part of the furnace blower systems, when they were actually in reference to the ventilation channels in the walls that straddle the gas chambers.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; These are visible on blueprints, and can still partly be seen in the ruined east wall of the Crematorium III gas chamber.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

Leuchter was also prepared to act as expert witness regarding crematoria ovens despite admitting during cross examination that he had no expert knowledge.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Leuchter presented his own estimate of 156 corpses as the total daily incineration capacity of the installations at Auschwitz. During cross-examination, he was presented with a letter written by the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (''Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung'') of June 28, 1943, from SS-''Sturmbannführer'' Jahrling to SS-''[[Brigadeführer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]] stating that the five crematoria installations had a collective daily capacity of 4,756 corpses. Leuchter conceded that this was quite different from his own figure, and that he had never seen the document in question before.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

A patent application by the makers of the ovens, (both of which were made during the war) and two independent testimonies confirmed the capacity of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Because the 4,756 figure is evidence of the Nazis equipping a camp of a maximum of 125,000 prisoners with the facility to cremate 140,000 of them per month, critics of Leuchter explain that this reveals the true exterminationist purpose of Auschwitz: a camp with the capacity to reduce its entire population to ash on a monthly basis was not merely a benign internment camp.&lt;ref name="nizqor1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar01.html|title=66 Questions and Answers about the Holocaust|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times (such as in the summer of 1944 when the crematoria couldn't keep up with the extermination rate), bodies were burnt in open-air pits. Accordingly, the capacity of the crematoria was never a limiting factor, and the pits yielded practically no limit to the number of corpses that could be burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=van Pelt|first=Robert Jan|title=The case for Auschwitz|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=252–253|year=2002|isbn=0-253-34016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTE TO EDITORS:  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Priority (first listing) is given to mnemonics with *reliable, verified references*, followed by other mnemonics that are actually *memorable* and useful.--&gt;
&lt;!-- Please do *not* add vanity mnemonics that you just made up with your or your friends' names, because they are useless to other readers. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;

==Spelling==

===Characteristic sequence of letters===
*I always comes before E (but after C, E comes before I)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Mnemonics|url=http://www.fun-with-words.com/mnem_example.html|work=Fun-with-words.com|accessdate=29 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kAl&gt;http://www.kidsandlearning.com/mnemonics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In most words like fr'''ie'''nd, f'''ie'''ld, p'''ie'''ce, p'''ie'''rce, misch'''ie'''f, th'''ie'''f, tier, it is '''"''i''"''' which comes before '''"''e''"'''. But on some words with '''''c''''' just before the pair of '''''e''''' and '''''i''''', like re'''cei'''ve, per'''cei'''ve,  '''"''e''"''' comes before '''"''i''"'''. This can be remembered by the following mnemonic,

:::'''''I''' before '''E''', except after '''C'''''

But this is not always obeyed as in case of w'''ei'''rd and w'''ei'''gh, w'''ei'''ght, h'''ei'''ght, n'''ei'''ghbor etc. and can be remembered by extending that mnemonic as given below

:::'''''I''' before '''E''', except after '''C'''''
:::''Or when sounded "'''''A'''''" as in n'''ei'''ghbor, w'''ei'''gh and w'''ei'''ght''
:::''Or  when sounded like "'''''eye'''''" as in  h'''ei'''ght''
:::''And "w'''ei'''rd" is just '''weird'''''

Another variant, which avoids confusion when the two letters represent different sounds instead of a single sound, as in atheist or being, runs

:::When it says ee
:::Put i before e
:::But not after c

*'''Where ever there is a Q there is a U too'''
Most frequently ''u'' follows ''q''. e.g.: Que, queen, question, quack, quark, quartz, quarry, quit, Pique, torque, maca'''qu'''e, exchequer. Hence the mnemonic:
:::''Where ever there is a '''Q''' there is a '''U''' too''&lt;ref name="kAl"/&gt; (But this is violated by some words; see:[[List of English words containing Q not followed by U]])

===Letters of specific syllables in a word===

::Do not be'''lie'''ve a '''lie'''.&lt;ref name="kAl"/&gt;

*CEMETERY
::There are three "'''e'''"s buried in "c'''e'''m'''e'''t'''e'''ry".

===Distinguishing between similar words===
*Difference between Advice &amp; Advise, Practice &amp; Practise, Licence &amp; License etc.
Advice, Practice, Licence etc. (those with c) are nouns and Advise, Practise, License etc. are verbs.
:::''One way of remembering this is that the word ‘'''n'''oun’ comes before the word ‘'''v'''erb’ in the dictionary; likewise ‘'''c'''’ comes before ‘'''s'''’, so the '''n'''ouns are ‘practi'''c'''e, licen'''c'''e, advi'''c'''e’ and the '''v'''erbs are ‘practi'''s'''e, licen'''s'''e, advi'''s'''e’.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-perfect.co.uk/grammartips/grammar-tip-practise-practice.asp Is it practise or practice? - Future Perfect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Principle and Principal
::Your princi'''pal''' is your '''pal'''
::A ru'''le''' can be called a princip'''le'''&lt;ref name="ab2000"/&gt;

*Remedial and Menial 
::Remedial work is meant to remedy.
::Menial work is boring but it's mean (-ial) to complain.

*Their, There and They're
::Theirs is not mine even though 'I' is in it.
::T'''here''' is w'''here''' we'll be.
::They're is a contraction of 'they are.'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10017">This is a '''list of organizations opposing mainstream science''' by frequently challenging the facts and conclusions recognized by the mainstream scientific community. By claiming to employ the scientific method in order to advance certain fringe ideas and theories, they are often charged with promotion of various forms of [[pseudoscience]].

== List of organizations ==
* [[American Federation of Astrologers]]
* [[Association for Neuro Linguistic Programming]] - a United Kingdom organization founded to promote [[neuro-linguistic programming]].
* [[Astrological Association of Great Britain]]
* [[Biodynamic Farming &amp; Gardening Association]] - a [[United States]]-based company that promotes [[biodynamic agriculture]] systems.
* [[Center for Indoor Air Research]] - tobacco industry front group producing industry-friendly research on indoor air quality, disbanded as part of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] in 1998.

A '''science magazine''' is a [[periodical literature|periodical publication]] with news, opinions and reports about [[science]], generally written for a non-[[expert]] audience. In contrast, a periodical publication, usually including primary research and/or reviews, that is written by scientific experts is called a "[[scientific journal]]". Science [[magazine]]s are read by non-scientists and [[scientist]]s who want accessible information on fields outside their [[Academic specialization|specialization]].

Articles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the [[news|general press]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11615">The '''soil composition of vineyards''' is one of the most important [[viticulture|viticultural]] considerations when planting grape vines. The [[soil]] supports the [[root]] structure of the vine and influences the drainage levels and amount of [[mineral]]s and nutrients that the vine is exposed to. The ideal soil condition for a vine is a layer of thin [[topsoil]] and [[subsoil]] that sufficiently retains water but also has good drainage so that the roots do not become overly saturated. The ability of the soil to retain heat and/or reflect it back up to the vine is also an important consideration that affects the ripening of the grapes.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 16"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 16 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several minerals that are vital to the health of vines that all good vineyard soils have. These include [[calcium]] which helps to neutralize the [[Soil pH]] levels, [[iron]] which is essential for [[photosynthesis]], [[magnesium]] which is an important component of [[chlorophyll]], [[nitrogen]] which is assimilated in the form of [[nitrates]], [[phosphates]] which encourages root development, and [[potassium]] which improves the vine metabolisms and increases its health for next year's crop.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 16"/&gt;

==List of soil terms==
''Unless otherwise noted the primary reference for this list is Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia 2005''

===A-C===
*Albariza - Formed by [[diatomaceous]] deposits. Found in southern [[Spain]]
*[[Alluvium]] - Highly fertile soil that has been transported by a river. Often contains [[gravel]], [[sand]] and [[silt]].
*[[Basalt]] - [[Volcanic rock]] that is high in calcium, iron, and magnesium. Variable potassium and little or no quartz.
*Boulbènes - Fine [[siliceous]] soil that is easily compressed and common in the [[Entre-Deux-Mers]] region of [[Bordeaux]].
*[[Brickearth]] - ''See under'' [[Loess]].
*[[Calcareous|Calcareous soil]] - [[Alkaline soil]] with high levels of [[Calcium carbonate|calcium]] and [[Magnesium carbonate]]. Typically cool in temperature soil that provides good water retention and drainage. '''Calcareous clay''' soils have high [[limestone]] content that neutralizes natural acidity of the soil. However the cool temperatures of the soil normally delay ripening in the grape which tends to produce more acidic wines.
*Carbonaceous soil - Soil produced through the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of rotting vegetation. This type of soil includes [[anthracite]], [[coal]], [[lignite]] and [[peat]].
*[[Chalk]] - Very [[porous]] soft limestone soil that vine roots can easily penetrate. It provides good drainage and works best for grapes with high acidity levels.
*[[Clay]] - [[Sedimentary rock]] based soil that has good water retention ability but poor drainage. The soil is often very cool and high in acidity. The Right Bank of [[Bordeaux]] is dominated by clay based soils.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;E. S. Brown ''"[http://winegeeks.com/articles/139 The World's Top 10 Wine Soils] Wine Geeks 7/5/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===D-H===
*[[Dolomite]] - Calcium-magnesium carbonate soil.
*[[Flint]] - Siliceous stone that reflects and retains heat well. The [[Pouilly-Fumé]] wine of the [[Loire Valley]] is generally produced from flint-based soil and is said to have "gun-flint" smell in the wine.
*Galestro - [[Schist]] based soil found in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]].
*[[Granite]] - Composed of 40-60% quartz, 30-40% [[Orthoclase]] and various amounts of [[hornblende]], [[mica]], and other minerals. This soil warms quickly and retains heat well. The soil's high level of acidity works to minimize the acid levels in the grapes which works well with acidic grapes like [[Gamay]]. It is the main soil type of the Brand region of [[Alsace]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Gravel]] - Loose siliceous pebble soil that has good drainage but poor fertility. Vines planted in this type of soil must penetrate deeply to try to and find nutrients in the subsoil. Wine made from vines produces on clay gravel beds have less acidity than those planted on limestone gravel beds. The [[Graves (wine region)|Graves]] and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] regions of Bordeaux consist predominantly of gravel-based soil.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Greywacke]] - Sedimentary soil formed by rivers depositing quartz, [[mudstone]] and [[feldspar]]. It is found in vineyards of [[Germany]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].
*[[Gypsum]] - [[Calcium sulfate]] based soil that is formed through the [[evaporation]] of [[seawater]]. It is a high absorbent soil that has average drainage ability.
*[[Hardpan]] - A dense layer of clay or other material that is impermeable to water. In some areas of [[Bordeaux]], a [[sand]]y iron-rich layer is located deep enough below the surface to act as a [[water table]] for the vine.

===I-Q===
*[[Keuper]] - Soil type consisting of [[marl]] and [[limestone]] common in [[Alsace]], dating to the [[Upper Triassic]] period.
*Kimmeridgian soil - A gray colored limestone based soil originally identified in [[Kimmeridge, England]]. '''Kimmeridgian clay''' is calcareous clay containing Kimmeridgian limestone. This is the principal soil type of the [[Loire Valley]], [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] regions.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Lignite]] - Soil type used as fertilizer in [[Germany]] and [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]]. It is a brown colored carbonaceous soil that is intermediate between [[peat]] and [[coal]].
*[[Limestone]] - Sedimentary based soil consisting of [[carbonates]]. The most common colored limestone found in wine producing area is buff-gray in color (with the exception of white [[chalk]]). The water retention abilities vary from composition but limestone is consistently [[alkaline]] and is generally planted with grapes of high acidity levels. This is the main soil type in the [[Zinnkoepflé]] region of Alsace.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*Llicorella - A soil type found in the [[Priorat (DOQ)|Priorat]] appellation of Spain. The soil is a mix of slate and quartz that dates to the [[Paleozoic]] era. The soil is very porous and drains well. [[Syrah]], [[Grenache]] and [[Carignan]] have done well in this soil type.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Loam]] - Warm, soft, fertile soil composed of roughly equal amounts of [[silt]], [[sand]] and [[clay]]. It is typically too fertile for high quality wines that need to limit yields in order to concentrate flavors.
*[[Loess]] - A very fine, predominantly silty soil composed of [[wind-borne sand|wind-borne sediment]] that is typically angular and decalcified. Commonly known as [[brickearth]] in the UK, the soil is very fertile and has good water retention and warming properties, but drains poorly.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, F. G. &amp; Culshaw, M. G. (2001). 'Problem soils - a review from a British perspective', in Jefferson, I., Murray, E. J., Faragher, E. and Fleming, P. R. (eds). ''Problematic soils'', 11-17, Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-3043-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Marl]] - Calcareous clay-based soil that adds acidity to the wine. Vines planted in this type of soil normally ripen later than in other soil types. Marl soil is typically deep and lacking in stone fragments; it is the main soil type in the [[Piedmont wine]] region of Italy. '''Marlstone''' is the indurated (well-cemented) metamorphic form of Marl.
*[[Mica]] - [[Silicate]] based soil composed of fine, decomposed rock formations.
*[[Muschelkalk]] -Soil type consisting of various compositions of [[sandstone]], marl, [[dolomite]], and [[slate|shingle]] common in Alsace dating back from the [[Middle Triassic]] period.
*[[Perlite]] - A [[volcanic]] soil type that is light, powdery and lustrous with properties similar to [[diatomaceous earth]].
*[[Quartz]] - Common material found in most vineyard soils - especially sand and silt based soils. The high [[Soil pH]] of quartz can reduce the acidity of the resulting wines but its heat retaining property that stores and reflects heat can increase ripening of the grape which can result in wine of higher alcohol content.

===S-Z===
*[[Sand]] - Warm, airy soil that is composed of tiny particles of weathered rocks. One of the few soils that the [[phylloxera]] louse does not thrive in, the soil drains well but does not have good water retention. '''Sandstone''' is a [[sedimentary soil]] composed of sand particles that has been pressured bound by various [[iron]] based minerals. This is the main soil type of [[Kitterlé]] in Alsace.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Schist]] - Laminated, [[crystalline]] rock based soil that retains heat well and is rich in [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] but is poor in organic nutrients and [[nitrogens]].
*[[Shale]] - Fine grain sedimentary based soil that can turn into [[slate]] when under pressure. The soil is moderately fertile and retains heat well.
*Siliceous soil - Soil composed of [[acid]] rock that are crystalline in nature. The soil has good heat retention but needs the added composition of [[silt]], [[clay]] and other sedimentary soils to have any kind of water retention. The range of this soil can include organic materials like [[Kieselguhr]] and [[flint]] or inorganic materials like [[quartz]]. This soil type covers half of the [[Bordeaux wine regions|wine regions]] of [[Bordeaux]].
*[[Silt]] - Soil type consisting of fine grain deposits that offer good water retention but poor drainage. It is more fertile than sand.
*[[Silex]] - A flint and sand based soil type found primarily in the [[Loire Valley]] that is a formed from a mixture of clay, limestone and [[silica]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Slate]] - Soil type that is the most common found in the [[Mosel wine|Mosel]] region. Slate is a metamorphic, plate-like rock formed when shale, clay, or [[siltstone]] is subjected to pressure deep within the earth. The soil retains heat well and warms up relatively quickly.
*Steige - A schist based soil found in the [[Andlau]] region of [[Alsace]]. In the [[Alsace Grand Cru AOC]] of Kastelberg, the soil has [[metamorphosed]] with [[granite]] sand to form a hard, dark slate like stone.
*[[Terra Rossa]] - A sedimentary soil, known as "Red Earth", that is formed after [[carbonates]] have been leached out of limestone. The breakdown leaves behind iron deposits which [[oxidizes]] and turns the soil a rustic red color. This soil type is found in some areas along the [[Mediterranean]] and in [[Coonawarra wine region|Coonawarra]]. The soil drains well and is relatively high in nutrients. Australian winemakers have found some success with [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] plantings.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Tufa]] - A highly-friable calcareous bedrock that breaks down into a fine crumb structure.
*[[Ultisol]] - a highly weathered, largely infertile, clay-based soil - usually brilliant red in color - found in the [[American South]].
*[[Volcanic soil]] - Soil that is derived from one of two volcanic activities. 1.) ''Vent-based soil'' is formed from rock material (including [[pumice]] and [[tuff]]) that has been ejected into the air and cooled before settling to the earth. 2.) ''Lava-based soil'' is the product of [[lava]] flows from the volcano. Ninety percent of lava-based soil is composed of [[basalt]] with the other ten percent composed of [[andesite]], [[pitchstone]], [[rhyolite]], and [[trachyte]].

==Overview==
The idea of [[action research]] as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the "application" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator {{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xii}}. This requires what [[Martin Buber]] called an "[[I and Thou|I-Thou]]" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's "I-Thou" approach toward another human being to an "I/you/we" approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} where he imagines living theory action research as forming an "I-theory" of knowledge. Director of the [[Philosophy for Children]] Project at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a [[critical theory]] and [[emancipation|emancipatory]] action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of [discourse].

A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his successful completion of a Ph.D. thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]], UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012b}}|2012b]]). The question is not "How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?" Rather the essential question is, "How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?"{{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xvii}} The theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process.

The phraseology "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009 because of her willingness to be transparent about her values and intentions. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research. In 2013, Whitehead and McNiff separated as collaborators as McNiff saw spiritual, emotional intelligence as key to action research while Whitehead disagreed and believed that media accounts (primarily video tapping people) of action research could provide clues to virtues which held the future of humanity though energy flowing examples of collaboration. McNiff stated in a May 2013 conference she San Francisco, California (ARNA Conference){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} that she would never appear or work with Whitehead again. She repeated this message again months later at a UK conference in York. American  William Barry believed the concept of LET was too important and found a dialectic between McNiff and Whitehead and he created a new understanding of LET which was presented at a three-day international conference in 2013 at [[Liverpool Hope University]] titled, "Researching Our Own Practice" {{harv|Barry|2013}}.

== Definition ==

Living educational theory was first clearly defined and developed by California Professor of Philosophy [[William Barry (educator)|William Barry]] (2012b) in [[Liz Atkins]] and [[Susan Wallace (educator)|Susan Wallace]]'s book {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012}}, ''Qualitative Research in Education'', co-published by [[Sage Publications|Sage]] and the [[British Educational Research Association]] (BERA). This book was one of four in a series sponsored by the BERA regarding best practice progressive research methods in educational research. The originality and uniqueness of Barry's development of living educational theory (LET) action research is the importance of gaining ''ontological weight'' through the action research process. Ontological weight empowers the researcher's ability, and the ability of other people involved in the action research project, to have the research experience and focus of the research be transformational and add, or at least reinforce, a sense of meaning in learning and life. Barry was influenced to use the concept "ontological weight" by the existentialist Catholic philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1963).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The idea of action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead, [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research.

Barry was asked by the BERA sponsored authors to reflect on the nature of living educational theory (LET) because there existed no clear definition of LET in the literature. Barry was asked because he had successfully used LET in an innovative fashion, and was the first to clearly define LET as based in [[critical theory]] {{harv|Wink|2011}} which embraced [[transpersonal psychology]] through his earned 2012 PhD thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]] Nottingham, UK. He proposed LET as a way of challenging the oppressive use of power using critical theory {{harv|Gorlewski|Gorlewski|Portfilio|2012}} in a need fulfilling way (Glasser 1998){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Barry proposed the following definition and approach to action research he calls living educational theory and his approach has been used as an action research method in undergraduate and graduate courses and research at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in Silicon Valley, California as well as by other researchers around the world.

Barry explained that living educational theory "[is] a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, 'How can I improve that I'm doing?' Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being a 'living contradiction' in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self – behavior which contradict the researcher's values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced..." {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012| p=131}}.

Barry's LET approach to action research was heavily influenced by action researchers focused on emancipatory social change, collaboration, and liberation theology ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012a}}|2012a]]). Prominent developers of LET, without whose work LET would most likely never had been developed by Barry, are notable action researchers, educators, and philosophers such as [[Martin Buber]]'s ([[#{{harvid|Buber|1970}}|1970]]) conception of 'I and Thou' and [[Krishnamurti]]'s (1953){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} liberation pedagogy emphasizing education as significant to leading a quality filled life; [[Paulo Freire]] (1998{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[#{{harvid|Freire|1970}}|1970]]) and his concept of participatory action research and the need to be politically aware; the work of Carr and Kremmis (1986){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Habermas]] (1992) and their concept and building critical educational knowledge; Professor Manheimer of UNC (1999){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and his challenge to his readers to enfold the past into the living present in order to become historical to oneself and then strive to linking life times with each other; Apple (1982){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Michel Foucault]] (1990){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the role of power and politics in education and Joe Kincheloe (2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, [[Henry Giroux]] (1997){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and [[Peter McLaren]] (1989){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and their promotion of critical pedagogy.

Prof. Barry was the first Ph.D. researcher to successfully use living educational theory in conjunction with [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[spiral dynamics]] and [[autoethnography]] (based on a [[multiple intelligences]] model which includes [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[emotional intelligence]] and embraces [[transpersonal]] knowing)  as valid methods of research working under the methodological umbrella of phenomenology and hermeneutics. His LET approach to Ph.D.level action research led to the unique use of fictional storytelling as a vehicle by which to replace the traditional literature review chapter in Ph.D. research but in a more rigorous and creative fashion. The process of [[storytelling]] allows the researcher to exercise their emotional intelligence in a superior manner than the traditional research literature review allows.

==Six cycles==

Living educational theory as defined and created by Barry is part of the curriculum of multiple courses at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] located in Silicon Valley, California in their credentialing program for teacher education. Barry's Living Educational Theory Action Research Method is based on a six step process&lt;ref&gt;(https://web.archive.org/web/20140310094005/http://www.ntu.edu/faculty-staff)&lt;/ref&gt; based on research questions that normally start from the format, " How can I influence the transformation of....?" or "How can I contribute to the improvement of...?" The research is dialectical in nature:

# I experience a crises in my sense of meaning when my values and beliefs as an educator/educational leader and/or learner are oppressed by my passive acceptance of the status quo and the use of oppressive power to change my identity. In essence, I experience narrative wreckage in my educational life (Thesis).
# I describe my contribution in promoting the [[status quo]] and my role in using oppressive power against others from both a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] perspective to illuminate my living contradictions (Anti-thesis)
# I develop a solution to transform and improve myself, influence the transformation and improvement of the fellow human beings with whom I interact and the social and work places I share with people.
# I enact [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in the direction of the solution I developed from a [[critical theory]] perspective.
# I evaluate the pragmatic outcomes of the solution based on the Hallmarks of Learning {{harv|Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur|2005}} and the implications from a holistic psychological perspective including [[transpersonal psychology]].
# I modify my use of power, pedagogy, valid and reliable [[Educational assessment|assessment]], and leadership to maximize social justice, ethical processes and results, and improve performance and knowledge as a result of my emerging living educational theory (LET) (Synthesis). As an iterative process, I start the cycle again within reasonable time constraints.

The '''Mars effect''' is a purported statistical correlation between [[Sportsperson|athletic]] eminence and the position of the planet [[Mars]] relative to the horizon at time and place of birth. This controversial finding was first reported by the [[France|French]] [[psychologist]] and "neo-astrologer"&lt;ref name=Pont&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pont|first=Graham|title=Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece|journal=Nexus Network Journal|date=2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1007/s00004-004-0003-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Gauquelin published in his book ''L'influence des astres'' ("The Influence of the Stars", 1955).&lt;ref&gt;I.W.Kelly, ''The Concepts of Modern Astrology: A Critique'' (University of Saskatchewan, online at http://www.astrosurf.com/nitschelm/Modern_criticism.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gauquelin suggested that a statistically significant number of sports champions were born just after the planet Mars rises or [[Culmination|culminates]]. Gauquelin divided the [[plane of the ecliptic]] into twelve [[Circular sector|sectors]], identifying two "key" sectors of [[statistical significance]].

Gauquelin's work was accepted by the notable psychologist and statistician [[Hans Eysenck]] among others&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Eysenck &amp; D.K.B. Nias, Astrology: Science or Superstition? Penguin Books (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; but later attempts to validate the data and replicate the effect have produced uneven results, chiefly owing to disagreements over the selection and analysis of the [[data set]]. Since the phenomenon in question depends upon the daily [[Rotation of Earth|rotation of the Earth]], the availability and accuracy of time and place of birth data is crucial to such studies, as is the criterion of "eminence". Later research claims to explain the Mars effect by [[selection bias]], favouring champions who were born in a ''key sector'' of Mars and rejecting those who were not from the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Willem Nienhuys (1997).

==Reception and replication==
Gauquelin's work was not limited to the Mars effect: his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of [[natal astrology]] as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out "highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people." This claim concerned not only Mars but five planets, correlated with eminence in fields broadly compatible with the [[Planets in astrology|traditional "planetary rulerships"]] of astrology. However, partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable, later research, publicity and controversy has tended to single out the "Mars effect".

===Belgian athletes – the Comité Para===
In 1956 Gauquelin invited the Belgian [[Comité Para]] to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that Jean Dath corroborated the statistics Gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using Belgian athletes. By this time Gauquelin had published ''Les Hommes et Les Astres'' (Men and the Stars, 1960), offering further data. The Comité Para tested the Mars effect in 1967 and replicated it, though most of the data (473 of 535) were still collected by Gauquelin himself. The committee, suspecting that the results might have been an artifact, withheld its findings for a further eight years, then cited unspecified “[[Demography|demographic]] errors” in its findings. Unpublished internal analyses contradicted this and one committee member, Luc de Marré, resigned in protest. In 1983 Abell, Kurtz and Zelen (''see below'') published a reappraisal, rejecting the idea of demographic errors, saying, “Gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of Mars sectors for birth times in the general population.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptical Inquirer'', 7(3), 77–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Zelen test===
In 1975 [[Paul Kurtz]]'s journal ''The Humanist'' published an article on astrology criticizing Gauquelin, to which the latter and his wife Françoise responded. Then Professor [[Zelen's design|Marvin Zelen]], a statistician and associate of the recently founded Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP, now known as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI)), proposed in a 1976 article in the same periodical that, in order to eliminate any demographic anomaly, Gauquelin randomly pick 100 athletes from his data-set of 2,088 and check the birth/planet correlations of a sample of babies born at the same times and places in order to establish a [[control group]], giving the base-rate (chance) expectation for comparison (The 100 random athletes later expanded into a subsample of 303 athletes).

In April 1977 CSICOP researcher [[George O. Abell]] wrote to Kurtz stating that Zelen's test had come out in the Gauquelins' favour. The Gauquelins also performed the test that Professor Zelen had proposed and carried out and found that the chance Mars-in-key-sector expectation for the general population (i.e., non-champions) was about 17%, significantly less than the 22% observed for athletic champions. However the subsequent article by Zelen, Abell and Kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data. In a rebuttal of the Gauquelins' published conclusion, Marvin Zelen analysed the composition, not of the 17,000 non-champions of the control group, but of the 303 champions, splitting this secondary subsample (which was already nearly too small to test 22% vs 17%) by eliminating female athletes, a subgroup that gave the results most favourable to Gauquelin, and dividing the remaining athletes into city/rural sections and [[Paris]]ian/non-Parisian sections.

Before and after publication of Zelen's results astronomer and charter CSICOP member [[Dennis Rawlins]], the CSICOP Council's only astronomer at the time, repeatedly objected to the procedure and to CSICOP's subsequent reportage of it. Rawlins privately urged that the Gauquelins' results were valid and the “Zelen test” could only uphold this and that Zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test, which was to check the base rate of births with Mars in the "key" sectors. It appeared to him that the test had minimised the significance of the Mars/key-sector correlations with athletes by splitting the sample of athletes and that the experimenters, who were supposed to be upholding scientific standards, were actually distorting and manipulating evidence to conceal the result of an ill-considered test.

The Kurtz-Zelen-Abell analysis had split the sample primarily to examine the randomness of the 303 selected champions, the non-randomness of which Rawlins demonstrated in 1975 and 1977. Zelen's 1976 "Challenge to Gauquelin" had stated: "We now have an objective way for unambiguous corroboration or disconfirmation ... to settle this question", whereas this aim was now disputed. Rawlins made procedural objections, stating; "... we find an inverse correlation between size and deviation in the Mars-athletes subsamples (that is, the smaller the subsample, the larger the success) – which is what one would expect if bias had infected the blocking off of the sizes of the subsamples".&lt;ref&gt;The Zetetic ([[Skeptical Inquirer]]) 2, no. 1, Fall/Winter 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt;

CSICOP also contended, after reviewing the results, that the Gauquelins had not chosen randomly. They had had difficulty finding sufficient same-week and same-village births to compare with champions born in rural areas and so had chosen only champions born in larger cities. The Gauquelins' original total list of about 2,088 champions had included 42 Parisians and their subsample of 303 athletes also included 42 Parisians. Further, Paris is divided into 20 ''[[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]]'', different economic classes and ethnic groups typically inhabiting different arrondissements. The Gauquelins had compared the 42 Parisian champions (who had been born throughout Paris) to non-champions of only one arrondissement. If the 22% correlation was an artifact partly based on factors such as rural recordkeeping, economic, class or ethnic differences in birth patterns, this fact would be blurred by this non-random selection.

===U.S. athletes – CSICOP===
At the same time CSICOP began a study of U.S. athletes in consultation with Zelen, Abell and Rawlins. The results, published in 1979&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]], [[Marvin Zelen]], and [[George O. Abell]] (1979). Results of the U.S. Test of the "Mars Effect" Are Negative, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Vol 4 #2, Winter 1979/80, 19–26&lt;/ref&gt; showed a negative result. Gauquelin contended the KZA group demonstrated an overall preference for mediocre athletes and ignored his criteria of eminence and that they included basketball players and people born after 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gauquelin and [[Françoise Gauquelin]] (1979). Star U.S. Sportsmen Display the Mars Effect, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Vol 4 #2, Winter 1979/80, 31–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CFEPP test ===
In 1994 the results of a major study undertaken by the [[Committee for the Study of Paranormal Phenomena]] (''Comité pour l’Étude des Phénomènes Paranormaux'', or CFEPP) in France found no evidence whatsoever of a "Mars Effect" in the births of athletes.&lt;ref name="Frenchbook"&gt;Benski, et al. 1993, as published in ''The "Mars Effect": A French Test of Over 1,000 Sports Champions'', [[Prometheus Books]] (1996). {{ISBN|0-87975-988-7}}. page ref:13, 15&lt;/ref&gt; The study had been proposed in 1982 and the Committee had agreed in advance to use the protocol upon which Gauquelin insisted. The CFEPP report was “leaked” to the Dutch newspaper ''Trouw''.

In 1990 the CFEPP had issued a preliminary report on the study, which used 1,066 French sports champions, giving full data for the 1,066 as well as the names of 373 who fit the criteria but for whom birth times were unavailable, discussing methodology and listing data-selection criteria. In 1996 the report, with a commentary by J. W. Nienhuys and several letters from Gauquelin to the Committee, was published in book form as ''The Mars Effect – A French Test of Over 1,000 Sports Champions''. The CFEPP stated that its experiment showed no effect and concluded that the effect was attributable to bias in Gauquelin’s data selection, pointing to the suggestions made by Gauquelin to the Committee for changes in their list of athletes.&lt;ref name="Frenchbook" /&gt;

=== Statistical explanation ===

Some researchers argued that Gauquelin did not adjust the statistical significance of the Mars Effect for [[multiple comparisons]] and did not address the issue in his publications. Simplified and illustrative showcase argument is explained here: There are 10 celestial bodies and 12 sectors for them to be in. Furthermore, there are 132 combinations of sector pairs and thus 1320 different combinations of a planet with two sectors. There is about a 25% chance to find at least one such combination (of one planet and two sectors) for a random dataset of the same size as Gauquelin’s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by Gauquelin.&lt;ref name=Panchin&gt;Alexander Y. Panchin. The Saturn-Mars Effect. ''Skeptic Magazine'' Vol 16 #1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the Mars effect is no longer statistically significant even at the modest [[significance level]] of 0.05 and is probably a false positive.

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in populations after 1950. Dean has put forward the idea that this may be due to increases in doctors reporting the time of birth rather than parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jonathan C.|title=Pseudoscience and extraordinary claims of the paranormal : a critical thinker's toolkit|date=2010|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9781405181235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about misreporting was unavailable to Gauquelin at the time. Dean had said that misreporting by 3% of the sample would explain the result.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite web|last=Dean|first=Geoffrey|title=The Mars Effect &amp; True Disbelievers|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-04-06/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mass spectrometry''' ('''MS''') is an analytical technique that ionizes [[chemical species]] and sorts the [[ion]]s based on their [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. In simpler terms, a [[mass spectrum]] measures the masses within a sample. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.

A mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or [[isotopic signature]] of a sample, the masses of particles and of [[molecule]]s, and to elucidate the chemical structures of [[molecules]] and other [[chemical compound]]s.

In a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gas, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break into charged fragments. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection.&lt;ref name="isbn0-9660813-2-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sparkman, O. David |title=Mass spectrometry desk reference |publisher=Global View Pub |location=Pittsburgh |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-9660813-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an [[electron multiplier]]. Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.

==History==
{{Details|History of mass spectrometry}}
[[File:Early Mass Spectrometer (replica).jpg|thumb|Replica of [[J.J. Thomson]]'s third mass spectrometer]]

In 1886, [[Eugen Goldstein]] observed rays in [[gas discharge]]s under low pressure that traveled away from the [[anode]] and through channels in a perforated [[cathode]], opposite to the direction of negatively charged [[cathode rays]] (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged [[anode rays]] "Kanalstrahlen"; the standard translation of this term into English is "[[canal rays]]". [[Wilhelm Wien]] found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (''Q/m''). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist [[J.J. Thomson]] later improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the mass spectrograph.

==Parts of a mass spectrometer==
[[Image:Mass Spectrometer Schematic.svg|thumb|Schematics of a simple mass spectrometer with sector type mass analyzer. This one is for the measurement of carbon dioxide [[isotope]] ratios ([[Isotope ratio mass spectrometry|IRMS]]) as in the [[carbon-13]] [[urea breath test]]]]

A mass spectrometer consists of three components: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. The ''[[ion source|ionizer]]'' converts a portion of the sample into ions.  There is a wide variety of ionization techniques, depending on the phase (solid, liquid, gas) of the sample and the efficiency of various ionization mechanisms for the unknown species. An extraction system removes ions from the sample, which are then targeted through the mass analyzer and into the ''detector''.  The differences in masses of the fragments allows the mass analyzer to sort the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The detector measures the value of an indicator quantity and thus provides data for calculating the abundances of each ion present. Some detectors also give spatial information, e.g., a multichannel plate.

===Theoretical example===
The following example describes the operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer, which is of the [[sector instrument|sector]] type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider a sample of [[sodium chloride]] (table salt). In the ion source, the sample is [[vapor]]ized (turned into [[gas]]) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged particles) into [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[chloride]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions. Sodium atoms and ions are [[Monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]], with a mass of about 23 u. Chloride atoms and ions come in two isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about 75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25 percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion's trajectory depends on its mass-to-charge ratio. Lighter ions get deflected by the magnetic force more than heavier ions (based on [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]], ''F'' = ''ma''). The streams of sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative abundance of each ion type. This information is used to determine the chemical element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents (the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl to &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl).

==Creating ions==
[[File:CARIBU at ATLAS.jpg|thumb|[[Surface ionization]] source at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] linear accelerator]]

The [[ion source]] is the part of the mass spectrometer that ionizes the material under analysis (the analyte). The ions are then transported by [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]]s to the mass analyzer.

Techniques for ionization have been key to determining what types of samples can be analyzed by mass spectrometry.
[[Electron ionization]] and [[chemical ionization]] are used for [[gas]]es and [[vapor]]s. In chemical ionization sources, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used with [[liquid]] and [[solid]] biological samples include [[electrospray ionization]] (invented by [[John Bennett Fenn|John Fenn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenn JB, Mann M, Meng CK, Wong SF, Whitehouse CM | title = Electrospray ionization for mass spectrometry of large biomolecules | journal = Science | volume = 246 | issue = 4926 | pages = 64–71 | date = October 1989 | pmid = 2675315 | doi = 10.1126/science.2675315 | bibcode = 1989Sci...246...64F | citeseerx = 10.1.1.522.9458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique "Soft Laser Desorption (SLD)" by K.

&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Hard ionization and soft ionization===
[[File:Fenn ESI Instrument.jpg|thumb|Quadrupole mass spectrometer and electrospray ion source used for Fenn's early work]]

In mass spectrometry, ionization refers to the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the [[ion source]]. There are several [[ion source]]s available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, [[electron ionization]] (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to [[high performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]], i.e. [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]], since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with [[gas chromatography|GC]], i.e. [[GC-MS]], where the entire system is under high vacuum.

Hard ionization techniques are processes which impart high quantities of residual energy in the subject molecule invoking large degrees of fragmentation (i.e. the systematic rupturing of bonds acts to remove the excess energy, restoring stability to the resulting ion). Resultant ions tend to have ''m/z'' lower than the molecular mass (other than in the case of proton transfer and not including isotope peaks). The most common example of hard ionization is electron ionization (EI).

Soft ionization refers to the processes which impart little residual energy onto the subject molecule and as such result in little fragmentation. Examples include [[fast atom bombardment]] (FAB), [[chemical ionization]] (CI), [[atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI), [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI).

===Inductively coupled plasma===
[[File:ICPMS Thermo torch 1.JPG|thumb|Inductively coupled plasma ion source]]

[[ICP-MS|Inductively coupled plasma]] (ICP) sources are used primarily for cation analysis of a wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.

===Photoionization mass spectrometry===
[[Photoionization]] can be used in experiments which seek to use mass spectrometry as a means of resolving chemical kinetics mechanisms and isomeric product branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osborn DL, Zou P, Johnsen H, Hayden CC, Taatjes CA, Knyazev VD, North SW, Peterka DS, Ahmed M, Leone SR | title = The multiplexed chemical kinetic photoionization mass spectrometer: a new approach to isomer-resolved chemical kinetics | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 104103–104103–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 19044733 | doi = 10.1063/1.3000004 | bibcode = 2008RScI...79j4103O | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc930185/ | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances a high energy photon, either X-ray or uv, is used to dissociate stable gaseous molecules in a carrier gas of He or Ar. In instances where a [[synchrotron]] light source is utilzed, a tuneable photon energy can be utilized to acquire a photoionization efficiency curve which can be used in conjunction with the charge ratio m/z to fingerprint molecular and ionic species.

===Other ionization techniques===
Others include [[glow discharge]], [[field desorption]] (FD), [[fast atom bombardment]] (FAB), [[thermospray]], [[desorption/ionization on silicon]] (DIOS), [[DART ion source|Direct Analysis in Real Time]] (DART), [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI), [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS), [[spark ionization]] and [[thermal ionization]] (TIMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bruins, A. P. |title = Mass spectrometry with ion sources operating at atmospheric pressure|year = 1991|journal = [[Mass Spectrometry Reviews]]|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 53–77|doi = 10.1002/mas.1280100104|bibcode = 1991MSRv...10...53B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass selection==
&lt;!-- "Mass accuracy" redirects here --&gt;
Mass analyzers separate the ions according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. The following two laws govern the dynamics of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields in vacuum:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = Q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; ([[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]]);

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's second law]] of motion in non-relativistic case, i.e. valid only at ion velocity much lower than the speed of light).

Here '''F''' is the force applied to the ion, ''m'' is the mass of the ion, '''a''' is the acceleration, ''Q'' is the ion charge, '''E''' is the electric field, and '''v''' × '''B''' is the [[vector cross product]] of the ion velocity and the magnetic field

Equating the above expressions for the force applied to the ion yields:

: &lt;math&gt;(m/Q)\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{E}+ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[differential equation]] &lt;!-- It doesn't look like one, but I'm not an expert --&gt;is the classic equation of motion for [[charged particle]]s. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of ''m/Q''. Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as "mass-to-charge spectrometers". When presenting data, it is common to use the (officially) [[dimensionless]] ''m/z'', where z is the number of [[elementary charge]]s (''e'') on the ion (z=Q/e). This quantity, although it is informally called the mass-to-charge ratio, more accurately speaking represents the ratio of the mass number and the charge number, ''z''.

There are many types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields, and magnetic or electric fields, but all operate according to the above differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses. Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)]]. In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed below, there are others designed for special situations.

There are several important analyser characteristics. The [[mass resolving power]] is the measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different ''m/z''. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the ''m/z'' measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in [[Parts per million|ppm]] or [[milli mass unit]]s. The mass range is the range of ''m/z'' amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.

===Sector instruments===
[[File:FAB MS.jpg|thumb|ThermoQuest AvantGarde sector mass spectrometer]]
{{Details|Sector mass spectrometer}}
A sector field mass analyzer uses a static electric and/or magnetic field to affect the path and/or [[velocity]] of the [[electric charge|charged]] particles in some way.
As shown above, [[sector instrument]]s bend the trajectories of the ions as they pass through the mass analyzer, according to their mass-to-charge ratios, deflecting the more charged and faster-moving, lighter ions more. The analyzer can be used to select a narrow range of ''m/z'' or to scan through a range of ''m/z'' to catalog the ions present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year = 1986|title = Extending the Mass Range of a Sector Mass Spectrometer | vauthors = Cottrell JS, Greathead RJ |journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews|volume = 5|pages = 215–247|doi = 10.1002/mas.1280050302|issue = 3|bibcode=1986MSRv....5..215C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time-of-flight===
{{Details|time-of-flight mass spectrometry}}
The [[time-of-flight]] (TOF) analyzer uses an [[electric field]] to accelerate the ions through the same [[voltage|potential]], and then measures the time they take to reach the detector. If the particles all have the same [[electrical charge|charge]], the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] tends to be identical, and their [[velocity|velocities]], in this case, will depend only on their [[mass]]es. Ions with a lower mass will reach the detector first.&lt;ref&gt;In the event that the ions do not start at identical kinetic energies, some ions may lag behind higher kinetic energy ions decreasing resolution.  Reflectron geometries are commonly employed to correct this problem.
{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/mas.1280120202 | title = Time-of-flight mass analyzers | year = 1993 | author = Wollnik, H. | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = 89–114 | issue = 2 | bibcode = 1993MSRv...12...89W }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, even particles with the same m/z can arrive at different times at the detector, because they have different initial velocities. The initial velocity is not dependent on the mass of the ion what becomes a problem for the TOF-MS. The difference in initial velocity turns into difference in the final velocity. In this way, ions with the same m/z are going to arrive at different times in the detector. For fixing this problem, time-lag focusing/[[delayed extraction]] has been coupled with TOF-MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guilhaus|first=Michae|title=Principles and Instrumentation in Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f8b2/3adb80b33deadb9a1e521409e84b9fdae04d.pdf|journal=Journal of Mass Spectrometry|volume=30|pages=1519È1532|via=Google Scholar|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quadrupole mass filter===
{{Details|Quadrupole mass analyzer}}
[[Quadrupole mass analyzer]]s use oscillating electrical fields to selectively stabilize or destabilize the paths of ions passing through a [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[quadrupole]] field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow a wide range of m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the [[quadrupole ion trap]], particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.
A magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Syed SU, Maher S, Taylor S | title = Quadrupole mass filter operation under the influence of magnetic field | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 1325–39 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24338888 | doi = 10.1002/jms.3293 | bibcode = 2013JMSp...48.1325S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maher S, Syed SU, Hughes DM, Gibson JR, Taylor S | title = Mapping the stability diagram of a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a static transverse magnetic field applied | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1307–14 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23720050 | doi = 10.1007/s13361-013-0654-5 | bibcode = 2013JASMS..24.1307M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A common variation of the transmission quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The “triple quad” has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector. If a quadrupole is made to rapidly and repetitively cycle through a range of mass filter settings, full spectra can be reported.  Likewise, a triple quad can be made to perform various scan types characteristic of [[tandem mass spectrometry]].

===Ion traps===

====Three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap====
{{Details|quadrupole ion trap}}
The [[quadrupole ion trap]] works on the same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, in which case the ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.

There are many mass/charge separation and isolation methods but the most commonly used is the mass instability mode in which the RF potential is ramped so that the orbit of ions with a mass {{math|''a'' &amp;gt; ''b''}} are stable while ions with mass ''b'' become unstable and are ejected on the ''z''-axis onto a detector. There are also non-destructive analysis methods.

Ions may also be ejected by the resonance excitation method, whereby a supplemental oscillatory excitation voltage is applied to the endcap electrodes, and the trapping voltage amplitude and/or excitation voltage frequency is varied to bring ions into a resonance condition in order of their mass/charge ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul W, Steinwedel H |year = 1953|title = Ein neues Massenspektrometer ohne Magnetfeld|journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A|volume = 8|issue = 7|pages = 448–450|bibcode = 1953ZNatA...8..448P|doi=10.1515/zna-1953-0710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = March RE |title = Quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry: a view at the turn of the century|year = 2000|journal = [[International Journal of Mass Spectrometry]]|volume = 200|issue = 1–3|pages = 285–312|doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00345-6|bibcode = 2000IJMSp.200..285M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cylindrical ion trap====
The [[cylindrical ion trap mass spectrometer]] (CIT) is a derivative of the quadrupole ion trap where the electrodes are formed from flat rings rather than hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to miniaturization because as the size of a trap is reduced, the shape of the electric field near the center of the trap, the region where the ions are trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.

====Linear quadrupole ion trap====
A [[linear quadrupole ion trap]] is similar to a quadrupole ion trap, but it traps ions in a two dimensional quadrupole field, instead of a three-dimensional quadrupole field as in a 3D quadrupole ion trap. Thermo Fisher's LTQ ("linear trap quadrupole") is an example of the linear ion trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz JC, Senko MW, Syka JE | title = A two-dimensional quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 659–69 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12056566 | doi = 10.1016/S1044-0305(02)00384-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A toroidal ion trap can be visualized as a linear quadrupole curved around and connected at the ends or as a cross section of a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to form the toroid, donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion trap mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lammert SA, Rockwood AA, Wang M, Lee ML, Lee ED, Tolley SE, Oliphant JR, Jones JL, Waite RW | title = Miniature toroidal radio frequency ion trap mass analyzer | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 916–922 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16697659 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2006.02.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the toroidal trap, linear traps and 3D quadrupole ion traps are the most commonly miniaturized mass analyzers due to their high sensitivity, tolerance for mTorr pressure, and capabilities for single analyzer tandem mass spectrometry (e.g. product ion scans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyder DT, Pulliam CJ, Ouyang Z, Cooks RG | title = Miniature and Fieldable Mass Spectrometers: Recent Advances | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–29 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26422665 | pmc = 5364034 | doi = 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orbitrap====
[[File:Orbitrap mass analyzer - partial cross-section.JPG|thumb|Orbitrap mass analyzer]]
{{Details|Orbitrap}}
[[Orbitrap]] instruments are similar to [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are [[electrostatic]]ally trapped in an orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back and forth along the central electrode's long axis. This oscillation generates an [[image current]] in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument. The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by [[Fourier transformation]] of the recorded image currents.

Orbitraps have a high mass accuracy, high sensitivity and a good dynamic range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Q, Noll RJ, Li H, Makarov A, Hardman M, Graham Cooks R | title = The Orbitrap: a new mass spectrometer | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 430–43 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15838939 | doi = 10.1002/jms.856 | bibcode = 2005JMSp...40..430H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance===
[[File:IonSpec FT-ICR (Fourier transform Ion cyclotron resonance) Mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|left|Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer]]
{{Details|Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance}}
[[Fourier transform mass spectrometry]] (FTMS), or more precisely [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] MS, measures mass by detecting the [[image current]] produced by ions [[cyclotron]]ing in the presence of a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an [[electron multiplier]], the ions are injected into a [[Penning trap]] (a static electric/magnetic [[ion trap]]) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be [[deconvolution|deconvoluted]] by performing a [[Fourier transform]] on the signal. [[FTMS]] has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is "counted" more than once) and much higher [[resolution (mass spectrometry)|resolution]] and thus precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Comisarow MB, Marshall AG |title = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy|year = 1974|journal = [[Chemical Physics Letters]]|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 282–283|doi = 10.1016/0009-2614(74)89137-2|bibcode = 1974CPL....25..282C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall AG, Hendrickson CL, Jackson GS | title = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry: a primer | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–35 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9768511 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1998)17:1&lt;1::AID-MAS1&gt;3.0.CO;2-K | bibcode = 1998MSRv...17....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ion cyclotron resonance]] (ICR) is an older mass analysis technique similar to FTMS except that ions are detected with a traditional detector. Ions trapped in a [[Penning trap]] are excited by an RF electric field until they impact the wall of the trap, where the detector is located. Ions of different mass are resolved according to impact time.

==Detectors==
[[Image:Cont dynode detector.jpg|thumb|A continuous dynode particle multiplier detector]]

The final element of the mass spectrometer is the detector. The detector records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by or hits a surface. In a scanning instrument, the signal produced in the detector during the course of the scan versus where the instrument is in the scan (at what ''m/Q'') will produce a [[mass spectrum]], a record of ions as a function of ''m/Q''.

Typically, some type of [[electron multiplier]] is used, though other detectors including [[Faraday cup]]s and [[ion-to-photon detector]]s are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. [[Microchannel plate detector]]s are commonly used in modern commercial instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A comparison between ion-to-photon and microchannel plate detectors|year = 1999|journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]]|volume = 13|issue = 9|pages = 786–791|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(19990515)13:9&lt;786::AID-RCM566&gt;3.0.CO;2-3 | vauthors = Dubois F, Knochenmuss R, Zenobi R, Brunelle A, Deprun C, Le Beyec Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[FTMS]] and [[Orbitrap]]s, the detector consists of a pair of metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = An inductive detector for time-of-flight mass spectrometry|year = 1994|journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]]|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 317–322|doi = 10.1002/rcm.1290080407 | vauthors = Park MA, Callahan JH, Vertes A |bibcode = 1994RCMS....8..317P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tandem mass spectrometry==
[[File:TandemMS.svg|thumb|Tandem mass spectrometry for biological molecules using ESI or [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI]]]]
A [[tandem mass spectrometer]] is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry, usually separated by some form of molecule fragmentation. For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one [[peptide]] from many entering a mass spectrometer. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by [[collision-induced dissociation]] (CID). A third mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also be done in a single mass analyzer over time, as in a [[quadrupole ion trap]]. There are various methods for [[Fragmentation (chemistry)|fragmenting]] molecules for tandem MS, including [[collision-induced dissociation]] (CID), [[electron capture dissociation]] (ECD), [[electron transfer dissociation]] (ETD), [[infrared multiphoton dissociation]] (IRMPD), [[blackbody infrared radiative dissociation]] (BIRD), [[electron-detachment dissociation]] (EDD) and [[surface-induced dissociation]] (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is in [[Mass spectrometry#Protein identification|protein identification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Boyd, Robert K. |title = Linked-scan techniques for MS/MS using tandem-in-space instruments|year = 1994|journal = [[Mass Spectrometry Reviews]]|volume = 13|issue = 5–6|pages = 359–410|doi = 10.1002/mas.1280130502|bibcode = 1994MSRv...13..359B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tandem mass spectrometry enables a variety of experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as [[selected reaction monitoring|selected reaction monitoring (SRM)]] and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is [[duty cycle]] limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined ''m/z'' value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.

Another type of tandem mass spectrometry used for [[radiocarbon dating]] is [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS), which uses very high voltages, usually in the mega-volt range, to accelerate negative ions into a type of tandem mass spectrometer.

==Common mass spectrometer configurations and techniques==
When a specific combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes conventional in practice, a compound [[List of mass spectrometry acronyms|acronym]] may arise to designate it succinctly. One example is [[MALDI-TOF]], which refers to a combination of a [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] source with a [[time-of-flight]] mass analyzer. Other examples include [[ICP-MS|inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)]], [[accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)]], [[thermal ionization|thermal ionization-mass spectrometry (TIMS)]] and [[spark ionization|spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS)]].

Certain applications of mass spectrometry have developed monikers that although strictly speaking would seem to refer to a broad application, in practice have come instead to connote a specific or a limited number of instrument configurations. An example of this is [[isotope ratio mass spectrometry|isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)]], which refers in practice to the use of a limited number of sector based mass analyzers; this name is used to refer to both the application and the instrument used for the application.

==Separation techniques combined with mass spectrometry==
An important enhancement to the mass resolving and mass determining capabilities of mass spectrometry is using it in tandem with [[chromatography|chromatographic]] and other separation techniques.

===Gas chromatography===
{{main|Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry}}
[[Image:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|left|A gas chromatograph (right) directly coupled to a mass spectrometer (left)]]

A common combination is [[gas]] chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a [[gas chromatograph]] is used to separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the [[ion]] source, a [[metal]]lic [[Electrical filament|filament]] to which [[voltage]] is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.&lt;ref&gt;Eiceman, G.A. (2000). Gas Chromatography. In R.A. Meyers (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry: Applications, Theory, and Instrumentation'', pp. 10627. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-97670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquid chromatography===
{{main|Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry}}
[[File:IMA Conservation Science.jpg|thumb|[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] conservation scientist performing [[liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry]]]]

Similar to gas chromatography MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically before they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of [[water]] and organic [[solvent]]s, instead of gas. Most commonly, an [[electrospray ionization]] source is used in LC-MS. Other popular and commercially available LC-MS ion sources are [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] and [[atmospheric pressure photoionization]]. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like [[laser spray]].

===Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry===
{{main|Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry}}

Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a technique that combines the liquid separation process of [[capillary electrophoresis]] with mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name="pmid2774189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loo JA, Udseth HR, Smith RD | title = Peptide and protein analysis by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 179 | issue = 2 | pages = 404–12 | date = June 1989 | pmid = 2774189 | doi = 10.1016/0003-2697(89)90153-X  }}&lt;/ref&gt; CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.&lt;ref name="pmid18790125"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maxwell EJ, Chen DD | title = Twenty years of interface development for capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta | volume = 627 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18790125 | doi = 10.1016/j.aca.2008.06.034 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-2670(08)01244-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ion mobility===
{{main|Ion-mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry}}

Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is a technique where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer.&lt;ref name='GFVerbeck06012002'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verbeck GF, Ruotolo BT, Sawyer HA, Gillig KJ, Russell DH | title = A fundamental introduction to ion mobility mass spectrometry applied to the analysis of biomolecules | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Techniques | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–61 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 19498967 | pmc = 2279851 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drift time is a measure of the radius relative to the charge of the ion. The [[duty cycle]] of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is longer than most mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matz LM, Asbury GR, Hill HH | title = Two-dimensional separations with electrospray ionization ambient pressure high-resolution ion mobility spectrometry/quadrupole mass spectrometry | journal = Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 670–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11921245 | doi = 10.1002/rcm.623 | bibcode = 2002RCMS...16..670M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duty cycle of IMS is short relative to liquid chromatography or gas chromatography separations and can thus be coupled to such techniques, producing triple modalities such as LC/IMS/MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sowell RA, Koeniger SL, Valentine SJ, Moon MH, Clemmer DE | title = Nanoflow LC/IMS-MS and LC/IMS-CID/MS of protein mixtures | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1341–53 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15337515 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2004.06.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data and analysis==
[[Image:ObwiedniaPeptydu.gif|thumb|Mass spectrum of a peptide showing the isotopic distribution]]

===Data representations===
{{See also|Mass spectrometry data format}}
Mass spectrometry produces various types of data. The most common data representation is the [[mass spectrum]].

Certain types of mass spectrometry data are best represented as a [[mass chromatogram]]. Types of chromatograms include [[selected ion monitoring]] (SIM), [[total ion current]] (TIC), and [[selected reaction monitoring]] (SRM), among many others.

Other types of mass spectrometry data are well represented as a three-dimensional [[contour map]]. In this form, the mass-to-charge, ''m/z'' is on the ''x''-axis, intensity the ''y''-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the ''z''-axis.

===Data analysis===
Mass spectrometry data analysis is specific to the type of experiment producing the data. General subdivisions of data are fundamental to understanding any data.

Many mass spectrometers work in either ''negative ion mode'' or ''positive ion mode''. It is very important to know whether the observed ions are negatively or positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but it also indicates something about the nature of the molecules.

Different types of ion source result in different arrays of fragments produced from the original molecules. An electron ionization source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged. Tandem mass spectrometry purposely produces fragment ions post-source and can drastically change the sort of data achieved by an experiment.

Knowledge of the origin of a sample can provide insight into the component molecules of the sample and their fragmentations. A sample from a synthesis/manufacturing process will probably contain impurities chemically related to the target component. A crudely prepared biological sample will probably contain a certain amount of salt, which may form [[adduct]]s with the analyte molecules in certain analyses.

Results can also depend heavily on sample preparation and how it was run/introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.

Mass spectrometry can measure molar mass, molecular structure, and sample purity. Each of these questions requires a different experimental procedure; therefore, adequate definition of the experimental goal is a prerequisite for collecting the proper data and successfully interpreting it.

====Interpretation of mass spectra====
[[File:Toluene ei ms.PNG|thumb|[[Toluene]] electron ionization mass spectrum]]
{{Main|Mass spectrum analysis}}
Since the precise [[Chemical structure|structure]] or [[peptide sequence]] of a molecule is deciphered through the set of fragment masses, the interpretation of [[Mass spectrum|mass spectra]] requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound is to compare its experimental mass spectrum against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tureček | first1 = František | last2 = McLafferty | first2 = Fred W. | name-list-format = vanc |year=1993|title=Interpretation of mass spectra|publisher=University Science Books|place=Sausalito|isbn=978-0-935702-25-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xQWk5WQfMQAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mass spectrometry software|software assisted interpretation of mass spectra]] must be performed. Computer simulation of [[ionization]] and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' structural information is fragmented ''[[in silico]]'' and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library&lt;ref&gt;Mistrik, R. (2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151406/http://www.highchem.com/publications/a-new-concept-for-the-interpretation-of-mass-spectra.html A New Concept for the Interpretation of Mass Spectra Based on a Combination of a Fragmentation Mechanism Database and a Computer Expert System.] in Ashcroft, A.E., Brenton, G., Monaghan, J.J. (Eds.), ''Advances in Mass Spectrometry'', Elsevier, Amsterdam, vol. 16, pp. 821.{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. [[Mass spectrometry software|Software]] taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and [[Peptide mass fingerprinting|proteins]].

Analysis of mass spectra can also be  spectra with [[accurate mass]]. A mass-to-charge ratio value (''m/z'') with only integer precision can represent an immense number of theoretically possible ion structures; however, more precise mass figures significantly reduce the number of candidate [[Molecule#Molecular formula|molecular formulas]].  A computer algorithm called formula generator calculates all molecular formulas that theoretically fit a given [[Accurate mass|mass]] with specified tolerance.

A recent technique for structure elucidation in mass spectrometry, called [[precursor ion fingerprinting]], identifies individual pieces of structural information by conducting a search of the [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem spectra]] of the molecule under investigation against a library of the [[Tandem mass spectrometry#Tandem MS experiments|product-ion spectra]] of structurally characterized precursor ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheldon MT, Mistrik R, Croley TR | title = Determination of ion structures in structurally related compounds using precursor ion fingerprinting | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 370–6 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19041260 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2008.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:WB-57 PALMS Mount.jpg|thumb|[[NOAA]] Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry [[aerosol mass spectrometer]] aboard a [[NASA]] [[Martin B-57 Canberra|WB-57]] high-altitude research aircraft]]

Mass spectrometry has both [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] uses. These include identifying unknown compounds, determining the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of elements in a molecule, and determining the [[structure]] of a compound by observing its fragmentation. Other uses include quantifying the amount of a compound in a sample or studying the fundamentals of [[gas phase ion chemistry]] (the chemistry of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now commonly used in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds.

As an analytical technique it possesses distinct advantages such as: Increased sensitivity over most other analytical techniques because the analyzer, as a mass-charge filter, reduces background interference, Excellent specificity from characteristic fragmentation patterns to identify unknowns or confirm the presence of suspected compounds, Information about molecular weight, Information about the isotopic abundance of elements, Temporally resolved chemical data.

A few of the disadvantages of the method is that it often fails to distinguish between optical and geometrical isomers and the positions of substituent in o-, m- and p- positions in an aromatic ring. Also, its scope is limited in identifying hydrocarbons that produce similar fragmented ions.

===Isotope ratio MS: isotope dating and tracing===
[[Image:Mass-spectrometer awi hg.jpg|thumb|Mass spectrometer to determine the &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope ratio on biogenous carbonate]]
{{Main|Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry}}
Mass spectrometry is also used to determine the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of elements within a sample. Differences in mass among isotopes of an element are very small, and the less abundant isotopes of an element are typically very rare, so a very sensitive instrument is required. These instruments, sometimes referred to as isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IR-MS), usually use a single magnet to bend a beam of ionized particles towards a series of [[Faraday cup]]s which convert particle impacts to [[electric current]]. A fast on-line analysis of [[deuterium]] content of water can be done using [[flowing afterglow mass spectrometry]], FA-MS. Probably the most sensitive and accurate mass spectrometer for this purpose is the [[accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometer]] (AMS). This is because it provides ultimate sensitivity, capable of measuring individual atoms and measuring nuclides with a dynamic range of ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; relative to the major stable isotope.&lt;ref name="Maher S, Jjunju FPM, Taylor S 2015 113–135"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Maher S, Jjunju FP, Taylor S |title=100 years of mass spectrometry: Perspectives and future trends |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=113–135 |year=2015 |doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.87.113 |bibcode=2015RvMP...87..113M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotope ratios are important markers of a variety of processes. Some isotope ratios are used to determine the age of materials for example as in [[carbon dating]]. Labeling with stable isotopes is also used for protein quantification. (see [[Mass spectrometry#Protein characterization|protein characterization]] below)

==== Membrane-Inlet Mass Spectrometry: Measuring gasses in solution ====
[[Membrane inlet mass spectrometry|Membrane-inlet Mass Spectrometry]], combines the Isotope ratio MS with a reaction chamber/cell separated by a gas-permeable membrane. This method allows the study of gasses as they evolve in solution. This method has been extensively used for the study of the production of oxygen by [[Photosystem II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shevela D, Messinger J | title = Studying the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen in photosynthetic and artificial systems by time-resolved membrane-inlet mass spectrometry | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 4 | pages = 473 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24324477 | pmc = 3840314 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2013.00473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace gas analysis===
Several techniques use ions created in a dedicated ion source injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: [[SIFT-MS selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry|selected ion flow tube]] (SIFT-MS), and [[Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry|proton transfer reaction]] (PTR-MS), are variants of [[chemical ionization]] dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics without the need for internal standard or calibration.

===Atom probe===
An [[atom probe]] is an instrument that combines [[time-of-flight]] mass spectrometry and field-evaporation microscopy to map the location of individual atoms.

===Pharmacokinetics===
{{Main|Pharmacokinetics}}
Pharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] with a [[quadrupole mass analyzer|triple quadrupole mass spectrometer]]. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is not uncommon to use [[curve fitting]] with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsieh Y, Korfmacher WA | title = Increasing speed and throughput when using HPLC-MS/MS systems for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic screening | journal = Current Drug Metabolism | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–89 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16787157 | doi = 10.2174/138920006777697963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Lee ED, Henion JD | title = High-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of drugs in biological samples | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 2453–60 | date = October 1986 | pmid = 3789400 | doi = 10.1021/ac00125a022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Crowther JB, Dewey EA, Henion JD | title = Thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry determination of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 474–81 | date = February 1985 | pmid = 3977076 | doi = 10.1021/ac50001a036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for [[microdosing]] studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to [[animal experimentation]].

===Protein characterization===
{{Main|Protein mass spectrometry}}
Mass spectrometry is an important method for the characterization and [[protein sequencing|sequencing]] of proteins. The two primary methods for ionization of whole proteins are [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as "[[top-down proteomics|top-down]]" strategy of protein analysis.  The top-down approach however is largely limited to low-throughput single-protein studies. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller [[peptides]] using [[protease]]s such as [[trypsin]] or [[pepsin]], either in [[solution]] or [[in-gel digestion|in gel]] after [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation. Other proteolytic agents are also used. The collection of peptide products are then introduced to the mass analyzer. When the characteristic pattern of peptides is used for the identification of the protein the method is called [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] (PMF), if the identification is performed using the sequence data determined in [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem MS]] analysis it is called [[de novo peptide sequencing]]. These procedures of protein analysis are also referred to as the "[[Bottom-up proteomics|bottom-up]]" approach.  A third approach however is beginning to be used, this intermediate "middle-down" approach involves analyzing proteolytic peptide larger than the typical tryptic peptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chait BT | title = Mass spectrometry in the postgenomic era | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 80 | pages = 239–46 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21675917 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-110810-095744 }}{{subscription required|via=Annual Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycan analysis===
Mass spectrometry (MS), with its low sample requirement and high sensitivity, has been predominantly used in [[glycobiology]] for characterization and elucidation of [[glycan|glycan structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Apte A, Meitei NS | title = Bioinformatics in glycomics: glycan characterization with mass spectrometric data using SimGlycan | volume = 600 | pages = 269–81 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19882135 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60761-454-8_19 | isbn = 978-1-60761-453-1 | series = Methods in Molecular Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass spectrometry provides a complementary method to [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] for the analysis of glycans. Intact glycans may be detected directly as singly charged ions by [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry]] (MALDI-MS) or, following permethylation or peracetylation, by [[fast atom bombardment|fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry]] (FAB-MS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Harvey DJ, Dwek RA, Rudd PM | title = Determining the structure of glycan moieties by mass spectrometry | journal = Current Protocols in Protein Science | volume = Chapter 12 | pages = 12.7.1–12.7.18 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 18429296 | doi = 10.1002/0471140864.ps1207s43 | isbn = 978-0-471-14086-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]] (ESI-MS) also gives good signals for the smaller glycans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blow N | title = Glycobiology: A spoonful of sugar | journal = Nature | volume = 457 | issue = 7229 | pages = 617–20 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19177129 | doi = 10.1038/457617a | bibcode = 2009Natur.457..617B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Glycobiology#Software for MS Data Interpretation|free and commercial software]] are now available which interpret MS data and aid in Glycan structure characterization.

===Space exploration===
[[File:Rosy Red to TEGA.jpg|thumb|NASA's [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix Mars Lander]] analyzing a soil sample from the "Rosy Red" trench with the [[Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer|TEGA]] mass spectrometer]]

As a standard method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two were taken to [[Mars]] by the [[Viking program]]. In early 2005 the [[Cassini–Huygens]] mission delivered a specialized [[GC-MS]] instrument aboard the [[Huygens probe]] through the atmosphere of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of the planet [[Saturn]]. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory and was able to vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen, hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's natural abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petrie S, Bohme DK | title = Ions in space | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 258–80 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17111346 | doi = 10.1002/mas.20114 | lastauthoramp = yes | bibcode = 2007MSRv...26..258P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on board the [[Cassini–Huygens]] spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's atmospheric composition as well as the composition of [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]' plumes. A [[Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer]] mass spectrometer was carried by the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Mars Phoenix Lander]] launched in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffman JH, Chaney RC, Hammack H | title = Phoenix Mars Mission--the thermal evolved gas analyzer | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 1377–83 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18715800 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2008.07.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass spectrometers are also widely used in space missions to measure the composition of plasmas. For example, the Cassini spacecraft carried the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caps.space.swri.edu/ |title=Cassini Plasma Spectrometer |access-date=2008-01-04 |publisher=[[Southwest Research Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which measured the mass of ions in Saturn's [[magnetosphere]].

===Respired gas monitor===
Mass spectrometers were used in hospitals for respiratory gas analysis beginning around 1975 through the end of the century. Some are probably still in use but none are currently being manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riker JB, Haberman B | title = Expired gas monitoring by mass spectrometry in a respiratory intensive care unit | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 223–9 | year = 1976 | pmid = 975846 | doi = 10.1097/00003246-197609000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found mostly in the [[operating room]], they were a part of a complex system, in which respired gas samples from patients undergoing [[anesthesia]] were drawn into the instrument through a valve mechanism designed to sequentially connect up to 32 rooms to the mass spectrometer. A computer directed all operations of the system. The data collected from the mass spectrometer was delivered to the individual rooms for the anesthesiologist to use.

The uniqueness of this magnetic sector mass spectrometer may have been the fact that a plane of detectors, each purposely positioned to collect all of the ion species expected to be in the samples, allowed the instrument to simultaneously report all of the gases respired by the patient. Although the mass range was limited to slightly over 120 [[atomic mass unit|u]], fragmentation of some of the heavier molecules negated the need for a higher detection limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gothard JW, Busst CM, Branthwaite MA, Davies NJ, Denison DM | title = Applications of respiratory mass spectrometry to intensive care | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 890–5 | date = September 1980 | pmid = 6778243 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2044.1980.tb03950.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparative mass spectrometry===
The primary function of mass spectrometry is as a tool for chemical analyses based on detection and quantification of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. However, mass spectrometry also shows promise for material synthesis.&lt;ref name="Maher S, Jjunju FPM, Taylor S 2015 113–135"/&gt; Ion soft landing is characterized by deposition of intact species on surfaces at low kinetic energies which precludes the fragmentation of the incident species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verbeck G, Hoffmann W, Walton B | title = Soft-landing preparative mass spectrometry | journal = The Analyst | volume = 137 | issue = 19 | pages = 4393–407 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22900257 | doi = 10.1039/C2AN35550G | bibcode = 2012Ana...137.4393V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soft landing technique was first reported in 1977 for the reaction of low energy sulfur containing ions on a lead surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Franchetti V, Solka BH, Baitinger WE, Amy JW, Cooks RG |title=Soft landing of ions as a means of surface modification |journal=Mass Spectrom.

[[File:Ringside.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Class ring|graduation ring]] with the Master of Science designation]]

A '''Master of Science''' ({{lang-la|Magister Scientiae}}; abbreviated '''MS''', '''M.S.''', '''MSc''', '''M.Sc.''', '''SM''', '''S.M.''', '''ScM''' or '''Sc.M.''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of science awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries or a person holding such a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/master_of_science|title=Master of Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a [[thesis]].

==Algeria==
Algeria follows the [[Bologna Process]].

==Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Panamá, Perú and Uruguay==
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Panamá]], [[Perú]] and [[Uruguay]], the Master of Science or Magister is a postgraduate degree of two to four years of duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission to a Master's program (Spanish: ''[[Maestría]]''; Portuguese: ''Mestrado'') requires the full completion of a four to five years long [[undergraduate degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] or a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s degree of the same length. Defense of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees qualify for a doctorate program.

==Australia==
Australian universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 1–2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, all universities, including [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] [[Jagannath University]], [[Dhaka University]], [[University of Chittagong]], [[Jahangirnagar University]], [[Islamic University, Bangladesh]] and [[Rajshahi University]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. After passing Bachelor of Science, any student becomes eligible to study in this discipline.

==Canada==
In Canada, Master of Science (MSc) degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a mixture. Master's programs typically take one to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required. Admission to a master's program is contingent upon holding a four-year university bachelor's degree. Some universities require a master's degree in order to progress to a doctoral program (PhD).

===Quebec===
In the province of Quebec, the Master of Science follows the same principles as in the rest of Canada. There is one exception, however, regarding admission to a master's program. Since Québécois students complete two to three years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before entering university, they have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Some undergraduate degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Education]] and the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] requires four years of studies. Following the obtention of their bachelor's degree, students can be admitted into a graduate program to eventually obtain a [[master's degree]].

==Chile==

Commonly the Chilean universities have used "Magíster" for a [[master degree]], but other than that is similar to the rest of South America.

==Czech Republic, Slovakia==
Like all EU member states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia follow the Bologna Process. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are using two master's degree systems. Both award a title of ''Mgr.'' or ''Ing.'' to be used before the name.
The older system requires a 5-year program. The new system takes only 2 years but requires a previously completed 3-year bachelor program (a ''Bc.'' title). It is required to write a thesis (in both master and bachelor program) and also to pass final exams. It is mostly the case that the final exams cover the main study areas of the whole study program, i.e. a student is required to prove his/her knowledge in many subjects he attended during the 2 resp. 3 years.

==Egypt==
The Master of Science (M.Sc.) is an academic degree for a post-graduate candidates or researchers, it usually takes from 4 to 7 years after passing the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. Master programs are awarded in many sciences in the [[Egyptian Universities]]. A completion of the degree requires finishing a [[pre-master]] studies followed by a scientific [[thesis]] or [[research]]. All M.Sc. degree holders are allowable to take a step forward in the academic track to get the [[PhD]] degree.

==Finland==
Like all EU member states, Finland follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree usually follows the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) studies which typically last five years. For the completion of both the bachelor and the master studies the student must accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Germany==
Like all EU member states, Germany follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree replaces the once common ''[[Diplom]]'' or ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' programs that typically lasted four to five years. It is awarded in science related studies with a high percentage of mathematics. For the completion the student must accumulate 300 ECTS Credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Southeastern Europe==
In Slavic countries in European southeast (particularly former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] republics), the education system was largely based on the German university system (largely due to the presence and influence of the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the region). Prior to the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], academic university studies comprised a 4-5 year long graduate ''[[Diplom]]'' program, which could have been followed by a 2-4 year long ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' program and then later with 2-4 year long ''[[Doctoral studies]]''.

After the Bologna Process implementation, again based on the German implementation, ''Diplom'' titles and programs were replaced by the M.Sc. and M.A. programs (depending on the field of study). The studies are structured such that a ''Master'' program lasts long enough for the student to accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, so its duration would depend on a number of credits acquired during the Bachelor studies. Pre-Bologna ''Magister'' programs were abandoned - after earning an M.Sc/M.A. degree and satisfying other academic requirements a student could proceed to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree directly.

==Guyana==
In Guyana, all universities, including [[University of Guyana]], [[Texila American University]], [[American International School of Medicine]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. Students who have completed undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree are eligible to study in this discipline

==Iran==
In Iran, similar to Canada, Master of Science (MSc) or in Iranian form ''[[Karshenasi-arshad]]'' degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or sometimes a mixture. Master's programs typically take two to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required.

==Ireland==
Like all EU member states, Ireland follows the Bologna Process. In Ireland, Master of Science (MSc) may be course-based with a research component or entirely research based. The program is most commonly a one-year program and a thesis is required for both course-based and research based degrees.

==Israel==
In Israel, Master of Science (MSc) may be entirely course-based or include research. The program is most commonly a two-year program and a thesis is required only for research based degrees.

==India==

In India, universities offer MSc programs usually in science subjects. Generally speaking, in India, post-graduate scientific courses lead to MSc degree while post-graduate engineering courses lead to ME or MTech degree. For example, a master's in automotive engineering would normally be an ME or MTech, while a master's in physics would be an MSc. A few top universities also offer undergraduate programs leading to a master's degree which is known as integrated masters.

A Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is also offered in India. It is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science. Some institutes such as [[IITs]] offer an MS degree for postgraduate engineering courses. This degree is considered a research-oriented degree where as MTech or ME degree is usually not a research degree in India. M.S. degree is also awarded by various [[IISER]]s which are one of the top institutes in India.

==Italy==
Like all EU member states, Italy follows the Bologna Process. The degree ''Master of Science'' is awarded in the Italian form, ''[[Laurea Magistrale]]'' (formerly ''Laurea specialistica''; before the introduction of the ''Laurea'' the corresponding degree was ''[[Laurea]] quinquennale'' or ''Vecchio Ordinamento'').

==Nepal==

In Nepal, universities offer the master of science degree usually in science and engineering areas. [[Tribhuvan University]] offers MSc degree for all the science and engineering courses. [[Pokhara University]] offers ME for engineering and MSc for science. [[Kathmandu University]] offers MS by Research and ME degrees for science and engineering.

==Netherlands==
Like all EU member states, the Netherlands follows the Bologna Process. A graduate who is awarded the title Master of Science (abbreviated as MSc) may still use the previously awarded Dutch title ''ingenieur'' (abbreviated as ir.) (for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program), ''meester'' (abbreviated as mr.) (for graduates who followed an LLM law program) or ''doctorandus'' (abbreviated as drs.)(in all other cases).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Norway==
Norway follows the Bologna Process. For engineering, the Master of Science academic degree has been recently introduced and has replaced the previous award forms "[[Sivilingeniør]]" (engineer, a.k.a. engineering master) and "Hovedfag" (academic master). Both were awarded after 5 years university-level studies and required the completion of a scientific thesis.

"Siv.ing", is a protected title exclusively awarded to engineering students who completed a five-year education at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology ({{lang-no|Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet}}, NTNU) or other universities.  Historically there was no bachelor's degree involved and today's program is a five years master's degree education. The "Siv.ing" title is in the process of being phased out, replaced by (for now, complemented by) the "M.Sc." title. By and large, "Siv.ing" is a title tightly being held on to for the sake of tradition. In academia, the new program offers separate three-year bachelor and two-year master programs. It is awarded in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science fields. The completion of a scientific thesis is required. All master's degrees are designed to certify a level of education and qualify for a doctorate program.

Master of Science in Business is the English title for those taking a higher business degree, "Siviløkonom" in Norwegian. In addition, there is, for example, the 'Master of Business Administration' (MBA), a practically oriented master's degree in business, but with less mathematics and econometrics, due to its less specific entry requirements and smaller focus on research.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan inherited its conventions pertaining to higher education from [[United Kingdom]] after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]]. Master of Science degree is typically abbreviated as M.Sc. (as in the United Kingdom) and which is awarded after 16 years of education (equivalent with a bachelor's degree in the USA and many other countries). Recently, in pursuance to some of the reforms by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body of higher education in Pakistan), the traditional 2-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree has been replaced by the 4-year Bachelor of Science degree, which is abbreviated as B.S. to enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world. Subsequently, students who pass 4-year B.S. degree that is awarded after 16 years of education are then eligible to apply for M.S. degree, which is considered at par with Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree.

==Poland==
Like all EU member states, Poland follows the Bologna Process. The Polish equivalent of Master of Science is "magister" (abbreviated "mgr", written pre-nominally much like "Dr"). Starting in 2001, the MSc programs typically lasting 5 years began to be replaced as below:
* 3-year associates programs (termed "licencjat". No abbreviated pre-nominal or title.)
* 3.5-year engineer programs (termed "inżynier", utilizing the pre-nominal abbreviation "inż.")
* 2-year master programs open to both "licencjat" and "inż." graduates.
* 1.5-year master programs open only to "inż." graduates.
The degree is awarded predominantly in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, economics, as well as in the arts and other disciplines. Those who graduate from an engineering program prior to being awarded a master's degree are allowed to use the "mgr inż." pre-nominal ("master engineer"). This is most common in engineering and agricultural fields of study. Defense of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.

==Russia==
The title of "master" was introduced by Alexander I at 24 January 1803. The Master had an intermediate position between the candidate and doctor according to the decree "About colleges structure". The master's degree was abolished from 1917 to 1934. Russia follows the [[Bologna Process]] for higher education in Europe since 2011.

==Spain==
Like all EU member states, Spain follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (MSc) degree is a program officially recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]]. It usually involves 1 or 2 years of full-time study. It is targeted at pre-experience candidates who have recently finished their undergraduate studies. An MSc degree can be awarded in every field of study. An MSc degree is required in order to progress to a PhD. MSci, MPhil and DEA are equivalent in Spain.

==Sweden==
Like all EU member states, Sweden follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science academic degree has, like in Germany, recently been introduced in Sweden. Students studying Master of Science in Engineering programs are rewarded both the English Master of Science Degree, but also the Swedish equivalent "Teknologisk masterexamen". Whilst "Civilingenjör" is an at least five year long education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/datateknik|title=Datateknik, civilingenjör 300 hp  - KTH|author=|date=|website=www.kth.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;   .

==Syria==
The Master of Science is a degree that can be studied only in public universities. The program is usually 2 years, but it can be extended to 3 or 4 years, the student is required to pass a specific bachelor's degree to attend a specific master of science degree program, the master of science is mostly a research master (except for some types of programs held with cooperation of foreign universities), The student should attend some courses in the first year of the master then he/she should prepare a research thesis. Publishing two research papers is recommended and will increase the final evaluation grade.

==United Kingdom==
The Master of Science (MSc) is typically a taught postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examinations and a project dissertation (normally taking up a third of the program). Master's programs usually involve a minimum of 1 year of full-time study (180 UK credits, of which 150 must be at master's level) and sometimes up to 2 years of full-time study (or the equivalent period part-time).&lt;ref name="QAA master's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.WK59n38WI2g|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught master's degrees are normally classified into Pass, Merit and Distinction (although some universities do not give Merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/msc_degree_classification/|title=MSc Classification|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities also offer MSc by research programs, where a longer project or set of projects is undertaken full-time; master's degrees by research are normally pass/fail, although some universities may offer a distinction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-research-mathematics?wssl=1|title=MSc by Research in Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent Master ''in'' Science (MSci or M.Sci.) degree (Master of Natural Science at the [[University of Cambridge]]), is an undergraduate (UG) level integrated master's degree offered by UK institutions since the 1990s. It is offered as a first degree with the first three (four in Scotland) years similar to a BSc course and a final year (120 UK credits) at master's level, including a dissertation.&lt;ref name="QAA master's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FHEQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final MSci qualification is thus at the same level as a traditional MSc.

==United States==
The ''Master of Science'' (''Magister Scientiæ'') degree is normally a full-time two-year degree often abbreviated "MS" or "M.S." It is the primary type in most subjects and may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a combination of the two. The combination often involves writing and defending a thesis or completing a research project which represents the culmination of the material learned.

Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]] and progressing to a [[doctorate|doctoral]] program may require a master's degree. In some fields or graduate programs, work on a doctorate can begin immediately after the bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's degree after about five years. Some universities use the Latin degree names and due to the flexibility of [[Latin grammar|word order in Latin]], ''Artium Magister'' (A.M.) or ''Scientiæ Magister'' (S.M. or Sc.M.) may be used in some institutions.

A '''Meker–Fisher burner''', or '''Meker burner''', is a [[laboratory equipment|laboratory]] [[Gas burner|burner]] that produces multiple open gas [[flame]]s, used for heating, sterilization, and combustion. It is used when laboratory work requires a hotter flame than attainable using a [[Bunsen burner]], or used when a larger-diameter flame is desired, such as with an [[inoculation loop]] or in some glassblowing operations. The burner was introduced by French chemist Georges Méker in an article published in 1905.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;G. Meker. Nouveaux bruleurs de laboratoire et leur application au chauffage a temperature elevee. J. Phys. Theor. Appl., 1905, 4 (1), pp. 348–354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meker–Fisher burner heat output can be in excess of {{convert|12000|BTU|abbr=on|lk=on}} per hour (about 3.5 k[[Watt|W]]) using [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durhamgeo.com/testing/laboratory/ovens-bunsen.htm Durham Geo].&lt;/ref&gt; Flame temperatures of up to {{convert|1100|-|1200|°C|°F|-2}} are achievable. Compared with a Bunsen burner, the lower part of its tube has more openings with larger total cross-section, admitting more air and facilitating better mixing of air and gas. The tube is wider, and its top is covered with a plate [[mesh]], which separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, ensures uniform heating, and also preventing [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Flashback|flashback]] to the bottom of the tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximal rate of air intake in a Bunsen burner. The flame burns without noise, unlike the Bunsen or [[Teclu burner]]s.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zco6AAAAIAAJ|page=38|title=Domestic Science, Volume 2|first= Charles W. |last=Hale| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= London|year= 1915|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Merodiploid''' is a partially diploid bacterium, which has its own [[chromosome]] complement and a chromosome fragment introduced by [[Conjugation (acid-base theory)|conjugation]], transformation or [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=merodiploid|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/merodiploid|journal=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as an essentially haploid [[organism]] that carries a second copy of a part of its genome. The term is derived from the Greek, meros = part, and was originally used to describe both unstable partial diploidy, such as that which occurs briefly in recipients after mating with an Hfr strain (1), and the stable state, exemplified by F-prime strains (see Hfr'S And F-Primes). Over time the usage has tended to confine the term to descriptions of stable genetic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-when-how.com/molecular-biology/merodiploids-molecular-biology/|title=Merodiploids (Molecular Biology)|website=What-when-how.com|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Merodiploidy''' refers to the partial duplication of chromosomes in a haploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural Genetic Transformation Generates a Population of Merodiploids in Streptococcus pneumoniae|first1=Calum |last1= Johnston |first2=Stéphanie |last2=Caymaris |first3=Aldert |last3=Zomer|first4=Hester J. |last4=Bootsma|first5=Marc |last5=Prudhomme|first6=Chantal |last6=Granadel|first7= Peter W.

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

==Branches of natural science==
{{Outline|Outline of natural science}}

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

'''Normalization process theory''' ('''NPT''') is a derivative  [[sociological theory]] of the implementation, embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational innovations developed originally from a collective set of learning workshops and included a large number of people including [[Carl R. May]], Tracy Finch, Elizabeth Murray, Anne Rogers, Catherine Pope, Anne Kennedy, Pauline Ong and . The theory is a contribution to the field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS), and is the result of a programme of theory building by May and a range of academics from applied social science to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;May CR, Mair F, Finch T, Macfarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, Rapley T, Ballini L, Ong BN, Rogers A, Murray E, Elwyn G, Légaré F, Gunn J, Montori VM. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: normalization process theory. Implement Sci. 2009 May 21;4:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Through three iterations, the theory has built upon the [[normalization process model]] previously developed by May et al. to explain the social processes that lead to the routine embedding of innovative health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization process theory focuses attention on agentic contributions – the things that individuals and groups do to operationalize new or modified modes of practice as they interact with dynamic elements of their environments. It defines the implementation, embedding, and integration as a process that occurs when participants deliberately initiate and seek to sustain a sequence of events that bring it into operation. The dynamics of implementation processes are complex, but normalization process theory facilitates understanding by focusing attention on the mechanisms through which participants invest and contribute to them. It reveals  "the work that actors do as they engage with some ensemble of activities (that may include new or changed ways of thinking, acting, and organizing) and by which means it becomes routinely embedded in the matrices of already existing, socially patterned, knowledge and practices".&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43(3), 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt;  These have explored objects, agents, and contexts. In a paper published under a [[creative commons license]], May and colleagues describe how, since 2006, NPT has undergone three iterations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Sibley, A. and Hunt, K. (2014) 'The nursing work of hospital-based clinical practice guideline implementation: An explanatory systematic review using Normalisation Process Theory', International Journal of Nursing Studies, 51(2), 289-299&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objects''. The first iteration of the theory focused attention on the relationship between the properties of a complex healthcare intervention and the collective action of its users. Here, agents' contributions are made in reciprocal relationship with the emergent capability that they find in the objects – the ensembles of behavioural and cognitive practices – that they enact. These socio-material capabilities are governed by the possibilities and constraints presented by objects, and the extent to which they can be made workable and integrated in practice as they are mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Agents''. The second iteration of the theory built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this was linked to the mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43, 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what people do to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what people do to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what people do to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what people do to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core of the theory, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice. 
* ''Contexts''. The third iteration of the theory developed the analysis of agentic contributions by offering an account of centrally important structural and cognitive resources on which agents draw as they take action.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2013. Towards a general theory of implementation. Implementation Science. 8, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, dynamic elements of social contexts are experienced by agents as capacity (the social structural resources, that they possess, including informational and material resources, and social norms and roles) and potential (the social cognitive resources that they possess, including knowledge and beliefs, and individual intentions and shared commitments). These resources are mobilized by agents when they invest in the ensembles of practices that are the objects of implementation.

Normalization process theory is regarded as a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to [[actor–network theory]] in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because normalization process theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with the interpretive approach of [[ethnography]] and other [[qualitative research methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, May CR, Montori VM, Mair FS.  Understanding patients' experiences of treatment burden in chronic heart failure using normalization process theory.  Annals of Family Medicine 2011;14(4):351-360.&lt;/ref&gt; it also lends itself to [[systematic review]]&lt;ref&gt;Mair F, May C, O'Donnell C, Finch T, Sullivan F, Murray E.  Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2012;90:357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, Jani B, Morrison D, Macdonald S, Blane D, Erwin P, May CR, Montori VM, Eton DT, Smith F, Batty DG, Mair FS.  Qualitative systematic reviews of treatment burden in stroke, heart failure, and diabetes - Methodological challenges and solutions.  BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013;13(10).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research methods]]. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, [[labor process theory]], and psychological theories including the [[theory of planned behavior]] and [[social learning theory]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as a topical overview of science:

'''[[Science]]''' – the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge—through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can be proved or not proved—and the knowledge thus acquired. The word "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia" meaning [[knowledge]]. A practitioner of science is called a "[[scientist]]". Modern science respects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[logical reasoning]], and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it. Some scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through research policies. These procedures are known as the [[#Scientific method|scientific method]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Essence of science ==
* [[Research]] – systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge.
* [[Scientific discovery]] – observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences.
* [[Laboratory]] – facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
* [[Objectivity (science)|Objectivity]] – the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc.
* [[Inquiry]] – any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem.

== Scientific method ==

[[Scientific method]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of scientific method|outline]]) – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.
* [[Empirical method]] –
* Experimental method – The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include:
*# Asking a question about a natural [[phenomenon]]
*# Making observations of the phenomenon
*# Forming a [[hypothesis]] – proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 
*# [[Predicting]] a logical consequence of the hypothesis
*# Testing the hypothesis through an experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are:
*#* [[Controlled experiment]] – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).
*#* [[Natural experiment]] – empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment.
*#** [[Observational study]] – draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator.
*#* [[Field experiment]] – applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory.  See also [[field research]].
*# Gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of [[uncertainty]].
*# Draw [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s by comparing data with predictions.  Possible outcomes:
*#* Conclusive:
*#** The hypothesis is falsified by the data.  
*#** Data are consistent with the hypothesis.
*#** Data are consistent with alternative hypotheses. 
*#* Inconclusive:
*#** Data are not relevant to the hypothesis, or data and predictions are [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurate]].
*#** There is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion.
* [[Deductive-nomological model]]
* [[Scientific modelling]] –
* Models of scientific method
** [[Hypothetico-deductive model]] – proposed description of scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data. A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.

[[Branches of science]] – divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its own [[terminology]] and [[nomenclature]].

=== Natural science ===
{{See also|Outline of science#Social science}}

[[Natural science]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of natural science|outline]]) – major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: biology, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.
* [[Branches of natural science]] (also known as the natural sciences)

=== Formal science ===
[[Formal science]] – branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems, such as those under the branches of: logic, mathematics, computer science, statistics, and some aspects of linguistics. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world, but instead with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules.

[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|frame|''[[The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' is famous in the US for its (not necessarily accurate) long-range weather predictions.]]

A '''prediction''' ([[Latin]] ''præ-'', "before," and ''dicere'', "to say"), or '''[[forecasting|forecast]]''', is a statement about a future [[event (probability theory)|event]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;. A prediction is often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. There is no universal agreement about the exact difference between the two terms; different authors and disciplines ascribe different [[connotation]]s. (Contrast with [[estimation]].)

Although future events are necessarily [[uncertainty|uncertain]], so guaranteed accurate information about the future is in many cases impossible, prediction can be useful to assist in making [[planning|plans]] about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business "...  is at least two things: Important and hard."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Howard, ed. ''Do lunch or be lunch''. Boston: [[Harvard Business School Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement-based prediction==
In a non-statistical sense, the term "prediction" is often used to refer to an [[hypothesis|informed guess or opinion]]&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, A., 2014. Modes of orientation provided by futures studies: making sense of diversity and divergence. European Journal of Futures Research, 2(1), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A prediction of this kind might be informed by a predicting person's [[abductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical evidence|experience]]; and may be of useful — if the predicting person is a [[expert|knowledgeable person]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Nate (2012) The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail--but some don't. The Penguin Press, New York, 534 p. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-411-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delphi method]] is a technique for eliciting such expert-judgement-based predictions in a controlled way.  This type of prediction might be perceived as consistent with statistical techniques in the sense that, at minimum, the "data" being used is the predicting expert's [[Cognition|cognitive experiences]] forming an [[intuition|intuitive]] [[Probability density function|"probability curve."]]

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]], prediction is a part of [[statistical inference]]. One particular approach to such inference is known as [[predictive inference]], but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one possible description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, D. R. (2006). Principles of Statistical Inference, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68567-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017|reason=Reference does not mention "forecasting" at all.}} Forecasting usually requires [[time series]] methods, while prediction is often performed on [[cross-sectional data]].

Statistical techniques used for prediction include [[regression analysis]] and its various sub-categories such as [[linear regression]], [[generalized linear model]]s ([[logistic regression]], [[Poisson regression]], [[Probit regression]]), etc. In case of forecasting, [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and [[vector autoregression]] models can be utilized. When these and/or related, generalized set of regression or [[machine learning]] methods are deployed in commercial usage, the field is known as [[predictive analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Eric (2013). Predictive analysis: The power to predict who will click, buy, lie, or die. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, NJ, 302 p. {{ISBN|978-1-118-35685-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many applications, such as time series analysis, it is possible to estimate the models that generate the observations. If models can be expressed as transfer functions or in terms of state-space parameters then smoothed, filtered and predicted data estimates can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Einicke, G.A.

 | url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/smoothing-filtering-and-prediction-estimating-the-past-present-and-future}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the underlying generating models are linear then a minimum-variance [[Kalman filter]] and a minimum-variance smoother may be used to recover data of interest from noisy measurements. These techniques rely on one-step-ahead predictors (which minimise the variance of the prediction error). When the generating models are nonlinear then stepwise linearizations may be applied within [[Extended Kalman Filter]] and smoother recursions. However, in nonlinear cases, optimum minimum-variance performance guarantees no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;Julier, S.J., Uhlmann, J.K. (2004). Unscented filtering and nonlinear estimation. Proceedings of the IEEE, 92(3), 401–422. doi =  10.1109/jproc.2003.823141. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1271397.&lt;/ref&gt;

To use regression analysis for prediction, data are collected on the variable that is to be predicted, called the [[dependent variable]] or response variable, and on one or more variables whose values are [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to influence it, called [[independent variable]]s or explanatory variables. A [[Function (mathematics)#Real-valued functions|functional form]], often linear, is hypothesized for the postulated causal relationship, and the [[parameter]]s of the function are [[estimation|estimated]] from the data—that is, are chosen so as to optimize is some way the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the function, thus parameterized, to the data. That is the estimation step. For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future (or current but not yet observed) values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, John (2016) Applied regression analysis and generalized linear models. Sage Publications, London, 791 p, third edition. {{ISBN|978-1-4522-0566-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would happen under specific conditions; for example, if an apple fell from a tree it would be attracted towards the center of the earth by [[gravity]] with a specified and constant [[acceleration]]. The [[scientific method]] is built on testing statements that are [[logical consequence]]s of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable [[experiment]]s or observational studies.

A [[scientific theory]] which is contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or [[falsifiability|falsified]] (see [[predictive power]]). Notions that make no ''testable'' predictions are usually &lt;!--only usually; string theory is considered science though no predictions can be tested--&gt;considered not to be part of science ([[protoscience]] or nescience) until testable predictions can be made.

[[Mathematical equation]]s and [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[computer model]]s, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the [[probability]] of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of [[quantum physics]].

In [[microprocessor]]s, [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] permits avoidance of [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] emptying at [[Branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. In [[engineering]], possible failure modes are predicted and avoided by correcting the mechanism causing the failure.

Accurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as [[natural disasters]], [[pandemics]], [[demography]], [[population dynamics]] and [[meteorology]]. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of [[solar cycle]]s, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).

===Scientific hypothesis and prediction===
Established science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, [[eclipse]]s are routinely predicted.

New theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Woodley, S.M. |author2=Catlow, R. |year=2008 |title=Crystal structure prediction from first principles |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=937–946 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute [[frame of reference]], which was given the name ''[[luminiferous ether]]''. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The [[special theory of relativity]] was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, the theory predicted that large masses such as [[star]]s would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.

==Finance==
[[File:Prediction market - example GUI - 2.gif|thumb|right|220px|[[Prediction market]]]]
Mathematical models of [[stock market]] behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a [[stock investor]] to [[Foresight (psychology)|anticipate]] or predict a [[stock market boom]], or a [[stock market crash]]. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions, including brokerage housesand consulting companies.

Some correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.

An [[actuary]] uses [[actuarial science]] to assess and predict future business [[risk]], such that the risk(s) can be [[Emergency management|mitigated]]. For example, in [[insurance]] an actuary would use a [[Actuarial table|life table]] (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project [[life expectancy]].

==Sports==

Predicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years.  Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]].  Early, well known sports bettors, such as [[Jimmy the Greek]], were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge.  Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.

Recent times have changed the way sports are predicted.  Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models.  Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team.  Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote “Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won’t put my money on it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gordon, Dan
 | date = 2005

 | publisher = Cardoza
 | location = New York, United States
 | isbn = 978-1-5804-2174-4
 | url = http://cardozabooks.com/BEAT-THE-SPORTS-BOOKS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in “look ahead” games etc.  As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.

The widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern [[sports betting systems]].  These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on [[regression analysis]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]], a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today.  He is currently paid as a consultant by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. [[Advanced NFL Stats|Brian Burke]], a former [[Navy]] fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Burke, Brian
 | date = 2008
 | title = NFL Win Prediction Methodology
 | url = http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/nfl-win-prediction-methodology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Pomeroy]] is widely accepted as a leading authority on college basketball statistics.  His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system.  Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems.  Dare wrote “the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dare, William H

==Opinion polls==
[[File:2004 canadian election approval ratings June 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Approval rating]]s (percentages) for the 2004 Canadian federal election]]

In [[politics]] it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of [[elections]] via [[political forecasting]] techniques (or assess the popularity of [[politicians]]) through the use of [[opinion polls]]. [[Prediction games]] have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.

==Supernatural prediction==
{{Main|Prophecy}}

Predictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] means such as [[prophecy]] or by observing [[omen]]s. Methods including [[water divining]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Oneiromancy|interpretation of dreams]], and many other forms of [[divination]], have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.

In literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events.  They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The [[New Testament]] book of [[Revelation|Revelation (Bible)]] thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a [[sermon]] or other public forum.

[[Divination]] is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency, most often describe as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.&lt;ref name="merriamw"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/divination ''Definition of divination'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction in fiction==
Fiction (especially fantasy, [[future history|forecasting]] and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means.
* In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[prophecy]], sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague 'feelings'. The character [[Galadriel]], in addition, employs a water "mirror" to show images, sometimes of possible future events.
* In some of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s stories, mutant humans called ''precogs'' can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called ''The Golden Man'', an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick's stories, ''[[The Minority Report]]'', which was turned into a [[Minority Report (film)|film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002.
* In the ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series by [[Isaac Asimov]], a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.
* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s sequels to 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called "[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]" out of the trap.
* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.

'''''Programming the Universe: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes On the Cosmos''''' is a 2006 [[popular science]] book by [[Seth Lloyd]], professor of mechanical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. The book proposes that the universe is a [[quantum computer]], and advances in the understanding of physics may come from viewing [[entropy]] as a phenomenon of information, rather than simply [[thermodynamics]].  Lloyd also postulates that the universe can be fully simulated using a quantum computer; however, in the absence of a theory of [[quantum gravity]], such a simulation is not yet possible.

==Reaction==
Reviewer [[Corey S. Powell]] of ''The New York Times'' writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the space of 221 dense, frequently thrilling and occasionally exasperating pages, …  tackles computer logic, thermodynamics, chaos theory, complexity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, consciousness, sex and the origin of life — throwing in, for good measure, a heartbreaking afterword that repaints the significance of all that has come before. The source of all this intellectual mayhem is the kind of Big Idea so prevalent in popular science books these days. Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering at M.I.T., takes as his topic the fundamental workings of the universe…, which he thinks has been horribly misunderstood. Scientists have looked at it as a ragtag collection of particles and fields while failing to see what it is as a majestic whole: an enormous computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, Lloyd writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;everything in the universe is made of bits. Not chunks of stuff, but chunks of information — ones and zeros. … Atoms and electrons are bits. Atomic collisions are "ops." Machine language is the laws of physics. The universe is a quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gilbert Taylor, writing in ''[[Booklist]]'' of the [[American Library Association]], said that the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;offers brilliantly clarifying explanations of the "bit," the smallest unit of information; how bits change their state; and how changes-of-state can be registered on atoms via quantum-mechanical qualities such as "spin" and "superposition." Putting readers in the know about quantum computation, Lloyd then informs them that it may well be the answer to physicists' search for a unified theory of everything. Exploring big questions in accessible, comprehensive fashion, Lloyd's work is of vital importance to the general-science audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400033861 Quoted on the Amazon website.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Science Commons''' (SC) was a [[Creative Commons]] project for designing strategies and tools for faster, more efficient web-enabled [[scientific research]]. The organization's goals were to identify unnecessary barriers to research, craft policy guidelines and legal agreements to lower those barriers, and develop technology to make research data and materials easier to find and use. Its overarching goal was to speed the translation of data into discovery and thereby the value of research.

Science Commons was located at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] in the [[Stata Center|Ray and Maria Stata Center]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].

==History==
[[Image:Science Commons-Stata-20050715.jpg|thumb|left|Science Commons office in 2005, MIT [[Stata Center]]]]

Creative Commons launched the Science Commons project in early 2005. The project sought to achieve for science what Creative Commons had achieved for the world of culture, art and educational material: to ease unnecessary legal and technical barriers to sharing, to promote innovation, and to provide easy, high quality tools that let individuals and organizations specify the terms under which they wished to share their material.

In 2009, Creative Commons terminated the Science Commons project.

==Projects==

===Biological Materials Transfer Project===

The Biological Materials Transfer Project, a [[Material transfer agreement]] (MTA), developed and deployed standard, modular contracts to lower the costs of transferring biological materials&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; such as [[DNA]], [[cell lines]], [[model animals]] and more. The MTA project covered transfer between non-profit institutions, as well as offering transaction solutions to transfers between non-profit entities and for-profit institutions. It integrated existing standard agreements and new Science Commons contracts into a Web-deployed suite, with the goal of developing a transaction system along the lines of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] or [[eBay]] by using the licensing as a discovery mechanism for materials. 

This metadata driven approach is based on the success of the Creative Commons licensing integration into search engines, further allowing for and facilitating the integration of materials licensing into the research literature itself and databases. The hope being that scientists would eventually be only one click away from accessing and/or ordering the materials referenced in the scholarly literature as they perform their research. Unfortunately, the MTA project's tools were not adopted by more than a very small percentage of the scientific community while Science Commons was active and, for all practical purposes, died out when the Science Commons project folded.

===Neurocommons===

Science Commons’ Neurocommons project set out to create an Open Source knowledge management platform for biological research. The platform combined open access materials (making up the knowledgebase) and open source software (in the form of an analytic platform). The software was still under development when the project ended.

===Scholar's Copyright Project===

The Scholar’s Copyright was developed with [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] designed to lower the barriers to [[Open Access]] (OA) by reducing transaction costs and eliminating contract proliferation by offering tools and resources catering to both methods of achieving Open Access. [http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/completeonline.shtml The Scholar's Copyright Addendum] is still in use by SPARC

====Open Access Data Protocol====
The Science Commons Open Access Data Protocol was a method for ensuring that scientific databases can be legally integrated with one another. The protocol was not a license or legal tool, but instead a methodology and best practices document for creating such legal tools in the future, and marking data in the public domain for machine-assisted discovery.

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L.

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5955">In [[science]], '''priority''' is the credit given to the individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or propose the theory. Fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding, even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently and at the same time. Thus between two or more independent discoverers, the first to make formal publication is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as the '''priority rule''', the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase "[[publish or perish]]", because there are no second prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strevens M|year=2003 |title= The Role of the Priority Rule in Science| journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=55–79| pmid= |pmc= |jstor=3655792}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of [[malaria|malaria transmission]], [[DNA]], [[HIV]], etc.); on the other hand, it can create an unhealthy competition, thus, becoming detrimental to scientific progress.&lt;ref name=fang&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fang FC, Casadevall A|year=2012 |title= Reforming science: structural reforms | journal=Infect Immun|volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=897–901 |pmid= 22184420| pmc=3294664|doi= 10.1128/IAI.06184-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priority disputes==
Priority becomes a difficult issue usually in the context of priority disputes, where the priority for a given theory, understanding, or discovery comes into question. In most cases historians of science disdain retrospective priority disputes as enterprises which generally lack understanding about the nature of scientific change and usually involve gross misreadings of the past to support the idea of a long-lost priority claim. Historian and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] once remarked that "debates about the priority of ideas are usually among the most misdirected in the history of science."&lt;ref&gt;Gould SJ (1977). ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Feynman]] told [[Freeman Dyson]] that he avoided priority disputes by "Always giv[ing] the bastards more credit than they deserve." Dyson remarked that he also follows this rule, and that this practice is "remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends." &lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, 2011, "The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman, " New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in {{ISBN|9781590178546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The priority rule came into existence before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established. For example, the earliest documented controversy was a bitter claim between [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the 17th century about priority in the invention of [[calculus]]. This particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice. It has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus. Since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies in the history of science.&lt;ref name=fang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors= Fang FC, Casadevall A|title=Intense Competition among Scientists Has Gotten out of Hand|date=25 July 2012| url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand |work= Scientific American |publisher= Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.|accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity, such as [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Albert Einstein]], priority questions are often rooted in taking too seriously the myth of the "[[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|lone genius]]" which is often cultivated around such quasi-mythic figures (see [[Great Man theory]] and [[Whig history]]). In an attempt to laud such scientists as visionaries, the context in which they worked is often neglected by popularizers, making it appear as if they worked without assistance or without reference to other work, something which is rarely the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tecnology Life Cycle.png|right|frame|The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise. The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime.]]

The '''technology life-cycle''' ('''TLC''') describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its "vital life". Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nInjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=The+technology+underlying+the+product+(for+example,+that+of+a+uniquely+flavoured+tea)+may+be+quite+marginal+but+the+process+of+creating+and+managing+its+life+as+a#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20technology%20underlying%20the%20product%20(for%20example%2C%20that%20of%20a%20uniquely%20flavoured%20tea)%20may%20be%20quite%20marginal%20but%20the%20process%20of%20creating%20and%20managing%20its%20life%20as%20a&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of IAC-MEM 2015 in Vienna|last=group of authors|publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education z.s., 2015|year=2015|isbn=9788090579156|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[product life-cycle management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. 

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]]s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The ''product'' of the technology may be a commodity such as [[polyethylene]] plastic or a sophisticated product like the [[integrated circuit]]s used in a [[smartphone]].

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the ''management'' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the [[technological maturity]] of a product. This is not similar to a [[product life cycle management|product life cycle]], but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology.

Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the [[mature technology|technology matures]].

==The four phases of the technology life-cycle==
The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:
#The '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the "bleeding edge") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
#The '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the "leading edge") 
#The '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and 
#The '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

===S-curve===
The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.improvementandinnovation.com/features/article/understanding-s-curve-innovation/|accessdate=15 October 2012|title=Understanding S-curve Innovation|journal=Improvementandinnovation.com|author=Dr. Chandana Jayalath|date=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology perception dynamics==
There is usually [[technology hype]] at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim.
Because of the [[logistic curve]] nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive.

The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal [[exponential growth]]
* fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing

[[Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Rogers' bell curve|300px]]
Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of [[mature technology|technology maturity]] and [[market saturation]].

The [[technology adoption life cycle]] typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in [[diffusion of innovations]] theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by [[Everett Rogers]], posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new [[innovation]]s and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/20309856/Technology-Management-Growth-Lifecycle Technology Management - Growth &amp; Lifecycle], Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&amp;D activities. In R&amp;D laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely.
*Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&amp;D laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical, mostly economic factors.
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion.
*Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics.

==Licensing options==
Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.&lt;ref&gt;Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===
There are always smaller firms ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Larger firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s – strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change.

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the ascent phase ===
The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the maturity phase===
The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity.

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[joint venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the decline phase===
After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations.

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology.

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

== Technology development cycle ==
According to the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], "In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156452/|title=Technological Innovation|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Technology development cycle'' describes the process of a new technology through the stages of technological maturity:

'''''The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics''''' is a 1989 book by [[mathematical physicist]] Sir [[Roger Penrose]].

Penrose argues that human [[consciousness]] is non-[[algorithm]]ic, and thus is not capable of being modeled by a conventional [[Turing machine]], which includes a [[digital computer]]. Penrose hypothesizes that [[quantum mechanics]] plays an essential role in the understanding of human [[consciousness]]. The [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the quantum wavefunction]] is seen as playing an important role in brain function.

The majority of the book is spent reviewing, for the scientifically minded layreader, a plethora of interrelated subjects such as [[Newtonian physics]], [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the philosophy and limitations of mathematics, [[quantum physics]], [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], and the nature of [[time]]. Penrose intermittently describes how each of these bears on his developing theme: that consciousness is not "algorithmic". Only the later portions of the book address the thesis directly.

==Overview==
Penrose states that his ideas on the nature of consciousness are speculative, and his thesis is considered erroneous by experts in the fields of philosophy, computer science, and robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/~llandau/Homepage/Math/penrose.html | title = Penrose's Philosophical Error | last = Landau | first = L.

Davis "How subtle is Godel’s theorem? More on Roger Penrose"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Davis|M. Davis]] (1995), "Is mathematical insight algorithmic", ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 13 (4), 659–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of this book, Penrose began to collaborate with [[Stuart Hameroff]] on a biological analog to quantum computation involving [[microtubules]], which became the foundation for his subsequent book, ''[[Shadows of the Mind|Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness]]''.

''The Emperor's New Mind'' attacks the claims of artificial intelligence using the physics of computing: Penrose notes that the present home of computing lies more in the tangible world of classical mechanics than in the imponderable realm of quantum mechanics. The modern computer is a deterministic system that for the most part simply executes algorithms. Penrose shows that, by reconfiguring the boundaries of a billiard table, one might make a computer in which the billiard balls act as message carriers and their interactions act as logical decisions. The [[billiard-ball computer]] was first designed some years ago by [[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Tommaso Toffoli]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

==Recognition==
Penrose won the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Science Book Prize]] in 1990 for this book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/ Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books: Previous winners]. ''[[The Royal Society]]''. Retrieved 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story''''' is a [[best-selling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DA1E39F937A35755C0A963958260 | title = Best Sellers|date= June 4, 1995 | accessdate = 2008-09-29|work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1995 [[nonfiction]] thriller by [[Richard Preston]] about the origins and incidents involving [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, particularly [[ebolavirus]]es and [[marburgvirus]]es. The basis of the book was Preston's 1992 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "Crisis in the Hot Zone".&lt;ref name="PrestonCrisis"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Richard |last=Preston |date=October 26, 1992 |title=Crisis in the Hot Zone |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/10/26/crisis-in-the-hot-zone |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Filoviridae|filoviruses]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Sudan virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Ravn virus]] are [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Biosafety Level 4]] agents. Biosafety Level 4 agents are extremely dangerous to humans because they are very infectious, have a high case-fatality rate, and have no known [[prophylactics]], treatments, or cures.

Along with describing the history of the diseases caused by these two [[Central Africa]]n diseases, [[Ebola virus disease]] and [[Marburg virus disease]], Preston described a 1989 incident in which a relative of Ebola virus, named [[Reston virus]], was discovered at a primate quarantine facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], less than 15 miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from [[Washington, D.C.]] The virus found at the facility was a mutated form of the original Ebola virus and was initially mistaken for [[Simian hemorrhagic fever virus|Simian hemorrhagic fever]]. The original Reston facility involved in the incident, located at 1946 Isaac Newton Square, was subsequently demolished on 30 May 1995, and a new building was constructed in its place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kindercare.com/our-centers/center-details/303031/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/eeegi/image/24157826 E.G. Bradshaw, Monkey House in Reston, Va]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book is in four sections:

* "The Shadow of Mount Elgon" delves into the history of filoviruses, as well as speculation about the origins of [[AIDS]]. Preston recounts the story of "Charles Monet" (a [[pseudonym]]), who might have caught Marburg virus from visiting [[Kitum Cave]] on [[Mount Elgon]] in [[Kenya]]. The author describes in great detail the progression of the disease, from the initial headache and backache, to the final stage in which Monet's internal organs fail and he "bleeds out" (i.e., hemorrhages extensively) in a waiting room in a Nairobi hospital. This part also introduces a young promising physician who became infected with Marburg virus while treating Monet. Nancy Jaax's story is told. Viruses, [[biosafety level]]s and procedures were described. The Ebola virus disease outbreaks caused by Ebola virus and its cousin, [[Sudan virus]], are mentioned. Preston talks to the man who named the Ebola virus.
* "The Monkey House" chronicles the discovery of [[Reston virus]] among imported monkeys in [[Reston, Virginia]], and the following actions taken by the [[U.S. Army]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]]. It starts with the monkey house receiving a shipment of 100 wild monkeys. After four weeks, 29 of these monkeys have died. This is followed by the veterinarian for the facility, Dan Dalgard, examining the dead monkeys and sending the samples to [[Peter Jahrling]], a virologist at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. After seeing a rope-like virus under the microscope, it is suspected that the monkeys were infected with a hot agent similar to the [[Marburg virus disease|Marburg]] virus. Jahrling then conducts a blood test to find out that the hot agent is the Ebola Zaire virus. This conclusion leads to the Army Medical Research Institute deciding to euthanize all the monkeys in the same room as the infected monkeys.
* "Smashdown" is more on the Reston epizootic, which involved a strain of the virus that does not affect humans but which easily spreads by air, and is very similar to its cousin the [[Ebola virus]].
* "Kitum Cave" tells of the author's visit of the cave that is the suspected home of the natural [[host (biology)|host]] animal that Ebola lives inside of.

The book starts with "Charles Monet" visiting [[Kitum Cave]] during a camping trip to Mount Elgon in Central Africa. Not long after, he begins to suffer from a number of symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea and red eye. He is soon taken to Nairobi Hospital for treatment, but his condition deteriorates further and he goes into a coma while in the waiting room. This particular filovirus is called [[Marburg virus]].

Dr. Nancy Jaax had been promoted to work in the Level 4 Biosafety containment area at the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]], and is assigned to research [[Ebola virus]]. While preparing food for her family at home, she cuts her right hand. Later, while working on a dead monkey infected with Ebola virus, one of the gloves on the hand with the open wound tears, and she is almost exposed to contaminated blood, but does not get infected. Nurse Mayinga is also infected by a nun and elects to visit Nairobi Hospital for treatment, where she succumbs to the disease.

In Reston, Virginia, less than fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from Washington, D.C., a company called Hazelton Research once operated a [[quarantine]] center for monkeys that were destined for laboratories. In October 1989, when an unusually high number of their monkeys began to die, their veterinarian decided to send some samples to Fort Detrick (USAMRIID) for study.  Early during the testing process in [[Biosafety level#Levels|biosafety level 3]], when one of the flasks appeared to be contaminated with harmless [[pseudomonas]] [[bacterium]], two USAMRIID scientists exposed themselves to the virus by [[waft]]ing the flask. They later determine that, while the virus is terrifyingly lethal to monkeys, humans can be infected with it without any health effects at all. This virus is now known as [[Reston virus]].

Finally, the author himself goes into Africa to explore Kitum Cave. On the way, he discusses the role of [[AIDS]] in the present, as the highway they were on, sometimes called the "[[Kinshasa Highway|AIDS Highway]]", or the "Kinshasa Highway", was where it first appeared. Equipped with a [[hazmat suit]], he enters the cave and finds a large number of animals, one of which might be the virus carrier. At the conclusion of the book, he travels to the quarantine facility in Reston.  He finds the building abandoned and deteriorating. He concludes the book by claiming that Ebola will be back.

== Reston Virus Outbreak ==
The discovery of the [[Reston virus]] was made in November 1989 by Thomas W. Geisbert, an intern at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. Dr. Peter B. Jahrling isolated the filovirus further. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted blood tests of the 178 animal handlers. While 6 tested positive, they did not exhibit any symptoms. The Reston virus was found to have low [[pathogenicity]] in humans. This was further supported later when a handler infected himself during a necroscopy of an infected monkey. However, the handler did not show symptoms of the virus after the incubation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC|last=McCormick|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7607-1208-5|location=|pages=298–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Hot Zone'' was listed as one of around 100 books that shaped a century of science by ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, P. 100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science. Retrieved February 17, 2016, from http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science&lt;/ref&gt; Listed as an “Exploration,” the criteria dictate that the book typically “seeks to engage with the context” elucidating the general topic rather than a specific nuance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Many reviews of ''The Hot Zone'' exemplify the impact the book had on the public’s view of [[Emergent virus|emerging viruses.]] A review in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' captures the paranoia and public panic described in this book. The reviewer was left “wondering when and where this enigmatic agent will appear next and what other disasters may await human primates.”&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, N. S.. (1994). [Review of The Hot Zone]. BMJ: British Medical Journal, 309(6962), 1168–1169. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/29725319&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be seen in a review in the ''Public Health Reports'' which highlights the “seriousness of our current situation” and “our ability to respond to a major health threat.”&lt;ref&gt;Morse, S. A.. (1995). The Year 2000: Only a Plane Flight Away from Disaster? [Review of The Hot Zone; The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance]. Public Health Reports (1974-), 110(2), 223–225. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4597805&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has been criticized for exaggerating the threat of [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and causing viral panic. In an interview about his book about Ebola, [[David Quammen]] claimed that ''The Hot Zone'' had “vivid, gruesome details” that gave an “exaggerated idea of Ebola over the years” causing “people to view this disease as though it was some sort of preternatural phenomenon.”&lt;ref&gt;Doucleff, M. (2014, November 11). How 'The Hot Zone' Got It Wrong And Other Tales Of Ebola's History.

''The Hot Zone'' is described as a “romantic account of environmental transgression.” Reactions to this book could be seen not only in the public’s view of emerging viruses, but in the changes in the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. In addition to the funding of public health infrastructure during the early 1970s, there were many public discussions of biodefense. This book continued to fuel the emerging diseases campaign. By connecting international health to [[Bioterrorism|national security]], this campaign used ''The Hot Zone'' as a method of justifying increased intervention in the global phenomena of disease.&lt;ref&gt;King, N. B.. (2004). The Scale Politics of Emerging Diseases. Osiris, 19, 62–76. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3655232&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' elicited a major response by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] by shedding light on the [[Ebola Zaire|Ebola Zaire outbreak]]. The release of teams of experts was immediate and massive. Many countries tightened their borders, issued warnings to custom officials, quarantined travelers, and issued travel advisories.&lt;ref&gt;Ungar, S.. (1998).

In his [[blurb]], horror writer [[Stephen King]] called the first chapter, "one of the most horrifying things I've read in my whole life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/richardpreston/bookshelf/hz.html | title=About The Hot Zone | publisher=Random House | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked whether any book "scared the pants off you" writer [[Suzanne Collins]] answered, "''The Hot Zone'', by Richard Preston. I just read it a few weeks ago. Still recovering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/08/12/suzanne-collins-on-the-books-she-loves/ | title=Suzanne Collins on the books she loves | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=Aug 12, 2010 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Jordan, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has received criticism for sensationalizing the effects of Ebola virus.  In their memoir ''Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC |isbn=978-0760712085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; former CDC scientists [[Joseph B. McCormick]] and [[Susan Fisher-Hoch]] lambasted Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact.  McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Adaptations==

===Failed film adaptation===
In January 1993, [[20th Century Fox]] and producer [[Lynda Obst]] won a bidding war for the film rights to Preston's 1992 ''New Yorker'' article, which was being transitioned into the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/fox-obst-contract-virus-pic-103313/ | title=Fox, Obst contract virus pic | publisher=Variety | date=January 24, 1993 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=Eller, Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to being outbid, [[Warner Bros.]] producer [[Arnold Kopelson]] immediately began working on the similarly themed ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'', a competing film which would ultimately be a factor leading to the collapse of ''Crisis in The Hot Zone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/virus-pic-fever-infects-fox-wb-118266/ | title=Virus pic fever infects Fox, WB | publisher=Variety | date=February 13, 1994 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=O'Steen, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors considered for the film adaptation included [[Wolfgang Petersen]] (who would later direct ''Outbreak''), [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], and [[Ridley Scott]].  Scott eventually signed on to direct the film in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 14, 1994 |title=Ridley Scott has signed on to direct "Crisis in the Hot Zone" |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=February 14, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Screenwriter James V. Hart was also signed to adapt the book.  In late-April 1994, Fox announced they had signed [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2, 1994 |title=Fox set the deals on "Crisis in the Hot Zone" for Robert Redford and Jodie Foster |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=May 2, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this version would ultimately not be made.  Foster dropped out of the film just before filming was to begin and production was delayed with [[Meryl Streep]], [[Sharon Stone]], and [[Robin Wright]] touted as possible replacements. In August 1994, Redford also dropped out of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 15, 1994 |title=Robert Redford has departed 20th Century Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone." |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-15-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 15, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days following Redford's departure, it was announced that pre-production had been shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 19, 1994 |title="Crisis" in the Not Zone |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 19, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===

It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of [[inertia]], [[momentum]] and [[acceleration]] in [[classical mechanics]].

==Philoponan theory==

In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] partly accepted Aristotle's theory that "continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force," but modified it to include his idea that the hurled body acquires a motive power or inclination for forced movement from the agent producing the initial motion and that this power secures the continuation of such motion. However, he argued that this impressed virtue was temporary; that it was a self-expending inclination, and thus the violent motion produced comes to an end, changing back into natural motion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aydin Sayili]] (1987), "Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1): 477–482 [477]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Avicennan theory==
{{Main|Physics in medieval Islam}}

In the 11th century, [[Avicenna]] discussed  Philoponus' theory in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', in Physics IV.14 he says;&lt;ref name="McGinnisReisman2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGinnis|first1=Jon|last2=Reisman|first2=David C.|title=Classical Arabic philosophy: an anthology of sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9ITPVoGjsoC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=16 June 2010|year=2007|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=978-0-87220-871-1|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When we independently verify the issue (of projectile motion), we find the most correct doctrine is the doctrine of those who think that the moved object acquires an inclination from the mover}} 
In the 12th century, [[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi]] adopted and modified Avicenna's theory on [[projectile motion]]. In his ''Kitab al-Mu'tabar'', Abu'l-Barakat stated that the mover imparts a violent inclination (''mayl qasri'') on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object distances itself from the mover.&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudo-Avicenna, Liber Celi Et Mundi: A Critical Edition|first=Oliver|last=Gutman|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2003|isbn=90-04-13228-7|page=193|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] later refer to Abu'l-Barakat in explaining that the acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing impetus.&lt;ref name=Gutman/&gt;

==Buridanist impetus==
In the 14th century, [[Jean Buridan]] postulated the notion of motive force, which he named impetus.{{quote|When a mover sets a body in motion he implants into it a certain impetus, that is, a certain force enabling a body to move in the  direction in which the mover starts it, be it upwards, downwards, sidewards, or in a circle.  The implanted impetus increases in the same ratio as the velocity.  It is because of this impetus that a stone moves on after the thrower has ceased moving it.  But because of the resistance of the air (and also because of the gravity of the stone) which strives to move it in the opposite direction to the motion caused by the impetus, the latter will weaken all the time.   Therefore the motion of the stone will be gradually slower, and finally the impetus is so diminished or destroyed that the gravity of the stone prevails and moves the stone towards its natural place.  In my opinion one can accept this explanation because the other explanations prove to be false whereas all phenomena agree with this one.&lt;ref name="Pedersen1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedersen|first=Olaf|title=Early physics and astronomy: a historical introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA210|accessdate=16 June 2010|date=1993-03-26|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-40899-8|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Buridan gives his theory a mathematical value: impetus = weight x velocity
Buridan's pupil Dominicus de Clavasio in his 1357 ''De Caelo'', as follows:

:"When something moves a stone by violence, in addition to imposing on it an actual force, it impresses in it a certain impetus. In the same way gravity not only gives motion itself to a moving body, but also gives it a motive power and an impetus, ...".

Buridan's position was that a moving object would ''only'' be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Buridan: Quaestiones on Aristotle's Physics |url=http://brahms.phy.vanderbilt.edu/a203/impetus_theory.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105959/http://brahms.phy.vanderbilt.edu/a203/impetus_theory.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buridan also maintained that impetus was proportional to speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects (such as celestial bodies) to move in a circle.

Buridan pointed out that neither Aristotle's [[unmoved movers]] nor Plato's souls are in the Bible, so he applied impetus theory to the eternal rotation of the celestial spheres by extension of a terrestrial example of its application to rotary motion in the form of a rotating millwheel that continues rotating for a long time after the originally propelling hand is withdrawn, driven by the impetus impressed within it.&lt;ref&gt;According to Buridan's theory impetus acts in the same direction or manner in which it was created, and thus a circularly or rotationally created impetus acts circularly thereafter.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote on the celestial impetus of the spheres as follows:

:"God, when He created the world, moved each of the celestial orbs as He pleased, and in moving them he impressed in them impetuses which moved them without his having to move them any more...And those impetuses which he impressed in the celestial bodies were not decreased or corrupted afterwards, because there was no inclination of the celestial bodies for other movements. Nor was there resistance which would be corruptive or repressive of that impetus."&lt;ref&gt;''Questions on the Eight Books of the Physics of Aristotle: Book VIII Question 12 '' English translation in Clagett's 1959 ''Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages '' p536&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by discounting the possibility of any resistance either due to a contrary inclination to move in any opposite direction or due to any external resistance, he concluded their impetus was therefore not corrupted by any resistance. Buridan also discounted any inherent resistance to motion in the form of an inclination to rest within the spheres themselves, such as the inertia posited by Averroes and Aquinas. For otherwise that resistance would destroy their impetus, as the anti-Duhemian historian of science Annaliese Maier maintained the Parisian impetus dynamicists were forced to conclude because of their belief in an inherent ''inclinatio ad quietem'' or inertia in all bodies.

This raised the question of why the motive force of impetus does not therefore move the spheres with infinite speed. One impetus dynamics answer seemed to be that it was a secondary kind of motive force that produced uniform motion rather than infinite speed,&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between primary motive forces and secondary motive forces such as impetus was expressed by Oresme, for example, in his ''De Caelo'' Bk2 Qu13, which said of impetus, "it is a certain quality of the second species...; it is generated by the motor by means of motion,.." [See p552 Clagett 1959]. And in 1494 Thomas Bricot of Paris also spoke of impetus as a second quality, and as an instrument which begins motion under the influence of a principal particular agent but which continues it alone. [See p639 Clagett 1959].&lt;/ref&gt; rather than producing uniformly accelerated motion like the primary force did by producing constantly increasing amounts of impetus. However, in his ''Treatise on the heavens and the world'' in which the heavens are moved by inanimate inherent mechanical forces, Buridan's pupil Oresme offered an alternative [[Thomism|Thomist]] inertial response to this problem in that he did posit a resistance to motion inherent in the heavens (i.e. in the spheres), but which is only a resistance to acceleration beyond their natural speed, rather than to motion itself, and was thus a tendency to preserve their natural speed.&lt;ref&gt;"For the resistance that is in the heavens does not tend to some other motion or to rest, but only to not being moved any faster." Bk2 Ch 3 ''Treatise on the heavens and the world''&lt;/ref&gt;

Buridan's thought was followed up by his pupil [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] (1316–1390), by writers in Poland such as [[John Cantius]], and the [[Oxford Calculators]]. Their work in turn was elaborated by [[Nicole Oresme]] who pioneered the practice of demonstrating laws of motion in the form of graphs.

==The tunnel experiment and oscillatory motion==

The Buridan impetus theory developed one of the most important [[thought experiments]] in the history of science, namely the so-called 'tunnel-experiment', so important because it brought oscillatory and pendulum motion within the pale of dynamical analysis and understanding in the science of motion for the very first time and thereby also established one of the important principles of classical mechanics. The pendulum was to play a crucially important role in the development of mechanics in the 17th century, and so more generally was the axiomatic principle of Galilean, Huygenian and Leibnizian dynamics to which the tunnel experiment also gave rise, namely that a body rises to the same height from which it has fallen, a principle of gravitational potential energy. As [[Galileo Galilei]] expressed this fundamental principle of his dynamics in his 1632 ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogo]]'':

{{quote|The heavy falling body acquires sufficient impetus [in falling from a given height] to carry it back to an equal height.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 22–3 and 227 of ''Dialogo'', [[Stillman Drake]] (tr.), University of California Press 1953, where the tunnel experiment is discussed. Also see Drake's 1974 translation of the ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi]]'' (pp. 206–8) on pp. 162–4 where Salviati presents 'experimental proof' of this postulate by pendulum motions.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This imaginary experiment predicted that a cannonball dropped down a tunnel going straight through the centre of the Earth and out the other side would go past the centre and rise on the opposite surface to the same height from which it had first fallen on the other side, driven upwards past the centre by the gravitationally created impetus it had continually accumulated in falling downwards to the centre. This impetus would  require a violent motion correspondingly rising to the same height past the centre for the now opposing force of gravity to destroy it all in the same distance which it had previously required to create it, and whereupon at this turning point the ball would then descend again and oscillate back and forth between the two opposing surfaces about the centre ''ad infinitum'' in principle. Thus the tunnel experiment provided the first dynamical model of oscillatory motion, albeit a purely imaginary one in the first instance, and specifically in terms of A-B impetus dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;For statements of the relationship between pendulum motion and the tunnel prediction, see for example Oresme's discussion in his ''Treatise on the Heavens and the World'' translated on p. 570 of Clagett's 1959, and Benedetti's discussion on p235 of Drake &amp; Drabkin 1959. For Buridan's discussion of pendulum motion in his ''Questiones'' see pp. 537–8 of Clagett 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this thought-experiment was then most cunningly applied to the dynamical explanation of a real world oscillatory motion, namely that of the pendulum, as follows. The oscillating motion of the cannonball was dynamically assimilated to that of a pendulum bob by imagining it to be attached to the end of an immensely cosmologically long cord suspended from the vault of the fixed stars centred on the Earth, whereby the relatively short arc of its path through the enormously distant Earth was practically a straight line along the tunnel. Real world pendula were then conceived of as just micro versions of this 'tunnel pendulum', the macro-cosmological paradigmatic dynamical model of the pendulum, but just with far shorter cords and with their bobs oscillating above the Earth's surface in arcs corresponding to the tunnel inasmuch as their oscillatory midpoint was dynamically assimilated to the centre of the tunnel as the centre of the Earth.

Hence by means of such impressive literally 'lateral thinking', rather than the dynamics of pendulum motion being conceived of as the bob inexplicably somehow falling downwards compared to the vertical to a gravitationally lowest point and then inexplicably being pulled back up again on the same upper side of that point, rather it was its lateral horizontal motion that was conceived of as a case of gravitational free-fall followed by violent motion in a recurring cycle, with the bob repeatedly travelling through and beyond the motion's vertically lowest but horizontally middle point that stood proxy for the centre of the Earth in the tunnel pendulum. So on this imaginative lateral gravitational thinking outside the box the lateral motions of the bob first towards and then away from the normal in the downswing and upswing become lateral downward and upward motions in relation to the horizontal rather than to the vertical.

Thus whereas the orthodox Aristotelians could only see pendulum motion as a dynamical anomaly, as inexplicably somehow 'falling to rest with difficulty' as historian and philosopher of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] put it in his 1962 ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'',&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 117–125 of the 1962 edition and pp. 118–26 of its 1970 second edition.&lt;/ref&gt; on the impetus theory's novel analysis it was not falling with any dynamical difficulty at all in principle, but was rather falling in repeated and potentially endless cycles of alternating downward gravitationally natural motion and upward gravitationally violent motion. Hence, for example, Galileo was eventually to appeal to pendulum motion to demonstrate that the speed of gravitational free-fall is the same for all unequal weights precisely by virtue of dynamically modelling pendulum motion in this manner as a case of cyclically repeated gravitational free-fall along the horizontal in principle.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 128–131 of his 1638 ''Discorsi'', translated on pp. 86–90 of Drake's 1974 English edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact the tunnel experiment, and hence pendulum motion, was an imaginary crucial experiment in favour of impetus dynamics against both orthodox Aristotelian dynamics without any auxiliary impetus theory, and also against Aristotelian dynamics with its H-P variant. For according to the latter two theories the bob cannot possibly pass beyond the normal. In orthodox Aristotelian dynamics there is no force to carry the bob upwards beyond the centre in violent motion against its own gravity that carries it to the centre, where it stops. And when conjoined with the Philoponus auxiliary theory, in the case where the cannonball is released from rest, again there is no such force because either all the initial upward force of impetus originally impressed within it to hold it in static dynamical equilibrium has been exhausted, or else if any remained it would be acting in the opposite direction and combine with gravity to prevent motion through and beyond the centre. Nor were the cannonball to be positively hurled downwards, and thus with a downward initial impetus, could it possibly result in an oscillatory motion. For although it could then possibly pass beyond the centre, it could never return to pass through it and rise back up again. For dynamically in this case although it would be logically possible for it to pass beyond the centre if when it reached it some of the constantly decaying downward impetus remained and still sufficiently much to be stronger than gravity to push it beyond the centre and upwards again, nevertheless when it eventually then became weaker than gravity, whereupon the ball would then be pulled back towards the centre by its gravity, it could not then pass beyond the centre to rise up again, because it would have no force directed against gravity to overcome it. For any possibly remaining impetus would be directed 'downwards' towards the centre, that is, in the same direction in which it was originally created.

Thus pendulum motion was dynamically impossible for both orthodox Aristotelian dynamics and also for H-P impetus dynamics on this 'tunnel model' analogical reasoning. But it was predicted by the impetus theory's tunnel prediction precisely because that theory posited that a continually accumulating downwards force of impetus directed towards the centre is acquired in natural motion, sufficient to then carry it upwards beyond the centre against gravity, and rather than only having an initially upwards force of impetus away from the centre as in the theory of natural motion. So the tunnel experiment constituted a crucial experiment between three alternative theories of natural motion.

On this analysis then impetus dynamics was to be preferred if the Aristotelian science of motion was to incorporate a dynamical explanation of pendulum motion. And indeed it was also to be preferred more generally if it was to explain other oscillatory motions, such as the to and fro vibrations around the normal of musical strings in tension, such as those of a zither, lute or guitar. For here the analogy made with the gravitational tunnel experiment was that the tension in the string pulling it towards the normal played the role of gravity, and thus when plucked i.e. pulled away from the normal and then released, this was the equivalent of pulling the cannonball to the Earth's surface and then releasing it. Thus the musical string vibrated in a continual cycle of the alternating creation of impetus towards the normal and its destruction after passing through the normal until this process starts again with the creation of fresh 'downward' impetus once all the 'upward' impetus has been destroyed.

This positing of a dynamical family resemblance of the motions of pendula and vibrating strings with the paradigmatic tunnel-experiment, the original mother of all oscillations in the history of dynamics, was one of the greatest imaginative developments of medieval Aristotelian dynamics in its increasing repertoire of dynamical models of different kinds of motion.

Shortly before Galileo's theory of impetus, [[Giambattista Benedetti]] modified the growing theory of impetus to involve linear motion alone:

{{quote|"…[Any] portion of corporeal matter which moves by itself when an impetus has been impressed on it by any external motive force has a natural tendency to move on a rectilinear, not a curved, path."&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Benedetti, selection from ''Speculationum'', in Stillman Drake and I.E. Drabkin, ''Mechanics in Sixteenth Century Italy'' (The University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benedetti cites the motion of a rock in a sling as an example of the inherent linear motion of objects, forced into circular motion.

== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
