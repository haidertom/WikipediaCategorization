'''Active duty''' is a full-time occupation as part of a military force, as opposed to [[Military reserve force|reserve duty]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the equivalent term is '''active service'''.

==India==
The [[Indian Armed Forces]] are considered to be one of the [[List of countries by size of armed forces|largest active service forces in the world]], with almost 1.42 million Active Standing Army. An additional 2.20 million reserve forces can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of India]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[India]]. This does not include the additional 1.40 million troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of India|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==Israel==
In the [[Israel Defense Forces]], there are two types of active duty: regular service ({{lang-he|שרות סדיר}}, ''Sherut Sadir''), and active [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] ({{lang-he|שרות מילואים פעיל}} ''Sherut Milu'im Pa'il'', abbr. ''Shamap''). Regular service refers to either mandatory service ({{lang-he|שרות חובה}}, ''Sherut Hova''), according to the laws of [[Israel]], or [[standing army]] service ({{lang-he|שרות קבע}}, ''Sherut Keva''), which consists of paid [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

Active reserve service refers to the actual time in which reservists are called up. This varies from once every few years to a month every year. During active reserve duty, [[military law]] can be applied to reservists, similarly to regular soldiers.

==Pakistan==
The [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] are one of the largest active service forces in the world, with almost 617,000 full-time personnel, due to the complex and volatile nature of Pakistan's relationship with India and the Kashmir region, and its porous border with Afghanistan. An additional 513,000 part-time reservists (including armed civilians of [[FATA]]) can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of Pakistan]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[Pakistan]]. This does not include the additional 427,627 troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==United States==
In the [[military of the United States|United States military]], active duty refers to military members who are currently serving on full-time status in their military capacity. Full-time status is not limited to members of the active components of the military services; members of any of the [[United States Armed Forces#Personnel in each service|three components]] (active, [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve]], and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]) may be placed into active status. All personnel in the active components are in active status.  Reservists may be placed into active status as units or individuals.  Units may be mobilized in support of operations, such as the reserve units that have been deployed in support of the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]] or those called up within the United States to provide [[Defense Support of Civil authorities|support to civil authorities]]. Individuals may be placed in active status as part of the [[Active Guard Reserve]] program, as augmentees to  active or reserve component units, or to attend full-time military training.

'''Allen Hershkowitz''' is an American [[environmental scientist]] who worked as a senior scientist at [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] from 1988 to 2014 and then at the Green Sports Alliance.

== Career ==
Hershkowitz started working at the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) around 1988.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pratt|first1=Timothy|title=NHL fights global warming by going carbon neutral|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/18/nhl-global-warming-carbon-neutral-in-a-bid-to|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] approached the NRDC for advice about how to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of the Oscar Awards show, after the academy was asked to do so by one of the producers of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''.  Hershkowitz, in his role as a senior scientist at the NRDC, helped them from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carpenter|first1=Susan|title=Stepping out on the recycled red carpet|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/02/stepping-out-onto-the-100-post-consumer-waste-recycled-red-carpet.html|work=LA Times Blogs - Greenspace|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[The Recording Academy]] asked the NRDC for help [[greening]] the Grammy Awards starting in 2008, and Hershkowitz led that effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Grammys Honor Great Music With Smaller Carbon Footprint|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2008/2008-02-11-097.html|work=Environmental News Service|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;


At an NRDC staff retreat in 2004, board member [[Robert Redford]] suggested that the NRDC establish more of a presence at professional sporting events; Hershkowitz told a reporter from ''Mother Jones'': "We were trying to figure out how to reach out to untraditional allies, and Redford says to us, 'You know, if you want to meet Americans, you’ve got to go to a baseball game or a football game. You’ve got to go to one of these stadiums. That’s where America is.'"&lt;ref name=MJ2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Ian|title=Can Stadium Sports Really Be Green?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/10/green-sports-stadiums-baseball-giants/|work=Mother Jones|date=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hershkowitz met with [[Bud Selig]] of the [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) shortly after that, and soon the NRDC was creating white papers and teams to advise all the major sports leagues about environmental sustainability initiatives that addressed each sport's needs and could help them save money.&lt;ref name=MJ2011/&gt;  Hershkowitz eventually ran the Sports Greening Initiative at the NRDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=Sports Industry Expands Its Environmental Initiatives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/sports-industry-expands-its-environmental-initiatives.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Green Sports Alliance got started in the late 2000s as informal discussions among management of sports teams in the Pacific Northwest, about how to improve their operations' sustainability.&lt;ref name=MJ2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinbach|first1=Paul|title=Conservation is King at Seattle's Safeco Field - Athletic Business|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/Stadium-Arena/conservation-is-king-at-seattle-s-safeco-field.html|work=Athletic Business|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of formalizing an alliance was generated in a meeting between Hershkowitz and representatives of sports teams owned by [[Paul Allen]] via [[Vulcan Inc.]], and GSA formally launched in the spring of 2011, with NDRC as one of the founding organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Luke|title=Green Sports Alliance: Go Green Or Go Home|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1768522/green-sports-alliance-go-green-or-go-home|work=Fast Company|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 Hershkowitz left the NRDC and became president of the GSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Green Sports Alliance Ushers in New Era of Influence|url=http://greensportsalliance.org/green-sports-alliance-ushers-new-era-influence/|publisher=Green Sports Alliance|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Hershkowitz was listed as the 50th most influential person in the field of [[Sport management|sports business]] by the ''[[Sports Business Daily]]'', which was the first time he had been on the list.  By the time of the listing, he had provided environmental sustainability advice to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[Major League Soccer]], and the [[U.S. Tennis Association]] that, according to the listing, had saved the leagues millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Most Influential: No. 50 — Allen Hershkowitz|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/12/07/Most-Influential/50.aspx|work=Sports Business Daily|date=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=A Future for the Used-Up Tools of the Tennis Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/sports/tennis/a-future-for-the-used-up-tools-of-the-tennis-trade.html|work=The New York Times|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In December 2015, the GSA under Hershkowitz's leadership helped organize two summits on sports sustainability at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blaustein|first1=Lew|title=The Paris Tragedy, COP21 and the Sustainable Innovation in Sport Symposium|url=https://greensportsblog.com/2015/11/20/the-paris-tragedy-cop21-and-the-sustainable-innovation-in-sport-symposium/|website=GreenSportsBlog|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The participation of representatives from major American professional sports associations marked the first time the sports industry were directly involved with climate change initiatives by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Adam|title=Sustainable Innovation in Sport: leading the line in the battle against climate change|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/magazine_features/sustainable_innovation_in_sport|website=SportsPro|publisher=SportsPro Media Limited|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 Hershkowitz left the GSA to focus on more global issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Green Sports Alliance President Allen Hershkowitz Departs to Pursue Global Green Sports Work -|url=http://greensportsalliance.org/green-sports-alliance-president-allen-hershkowitz-departs-to-pursue-global-green-sports-work/|work=Green Sports Alliance|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016 Sports and Sustainability International was formally launched; Hershkowitz was a member of its organizing committee, along with four other founding directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green-Sports Experts Launch “Sport and Sustainability International”|url=https://greensportsblog.com/2016/12/15/green-sports-experts-launch-sport-and-sustainability-international/|work=GreenSportsBlog|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23220">'''Androcentrism''' ([[Ancient Greek]], ἀνήρ, "man, male"&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Liddell | first1 = Henry G. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Robert | last3 = Stuart Jones | first3 = Henry | others = Roderick McKenzie | author-link1 = Edward Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | author-link3 = Henry Stuart Jones | title = [[A Greek–English Lexicon]] | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1940 | oclc = 499596825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of placing a [[masculine]] point of view at the center of one's [[world view]], culture, and history, thereby culturally marginalizing femininity. The related adjective is ''androcentric'', while the practice of placing the [[feminine]] point of view at the center is ''[[gynocentric]]''.

== Origin of the term ==

The term ''androcentrism'' was introduced as an analytic concept by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] in a scientific debate. Perkins Gilman described androcentric practices in society and the resulting problems they created in her investigation on ''The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture'', published in 1911.&lt;ref name="CPG_1911"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perkins Gilman | first = Charlotte | author-link = Charlotte Perkins Gilman | title = The man-made world: or, Our androcentric culture | publisher = Charlton | location = New York | year = 1911 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3015/3015-h/3015-h.htm | oclc = 988836210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity whereby all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as ''[[Other (philosophy)|other]]''. According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] while female patterns were considered as [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].&lt;ref name="CPG_1911" /&gt;

== Education ==
In the past boys and men were expected to have better formal education than girls and women. Girls and women were less frequently able to read and write than boys and men were; thus, written material tended to reflect the male point of view.  Well into the second half of the 20th century young men entered university far more frequently than young women.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Some universities such as the [[University of Oxford]] consciously practiced a [[numerus clausus]] and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|work=Times Higher Education|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "educated opinion" risked being androcentric.

== Literature ==

In the majority of societies today, books, magazine articles and book reviews are written predominantly by men and therefore may privilege a male viewpoint. For instance, in 2010 only 37% of the books published by [[Random House]] were written by women, and only 17% of the books reviewed by ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' were written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Franklin | first = Ruth | title = A Literary Glass Ceiling? Why magazines aren't reviewing more female writers | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/82930/VIDA-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews | work = [[The New Republic]] | date = February 7, 2011 | access-date = March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by VIDA in 2010 found that men wrote the vast majority of articles and book reviews in leading magazines in the United States and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VIDA | title = The Count 2010 | url = http://vidaweb.org/the-count-2010 | work = VIDA: Women in Literary Arts | date = May 16, 2011 | access-date = March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in 200 top-selling children's books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of [[Caldecott]] award-winning books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Mykol C. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = David | last3 = Broaddus | first3 = Michelle | last4 = Young | first4 = Kate | title = Gender stereotyping and under-representation of female characters in 200 popular children’s picture books: a twenty-first century update | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 55 | issue = 11&amp;ndash;12 | pages = 757&amp;ndash;765 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | date = December 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.

== TV and film ==

The vast majority of films are written and directed by men. This may result in an androcentric bias, with most films (and film characters) being created from a male perspective. Of the top 250 grossing films in 2007, 82% had no female writers and only 6% had a female director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lauzen | first = Martha M. | title = The celluloid ceiling report: behind-the-scenes employment of women in the top 250 films of 2007 | url = http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/Celluloid%20Ceiling%202007%20Full%20Report.pdf | publisher = Center for the study of women in television and film, [[San Diego State University]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of all film reviews published in the USA are written by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lauzen | first = Martha M. | title = Thumbs down - representation of women film critics in the top 100 U.S. daily newspapers | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110312222038/http://awfj.org/hot-topic/thumbs-down-representation-of-women-film-critics-in-the-top-100-us-newspapers-a-study-by-dr-martha-lauzen | archive-date = 12 March 2011 | url = http://awfj.org/hot-topic/thumbs-down-representation-of-women-film-critics-in-the-top-100-us-newspapers-a-study-by-dr-martha-lauzen/ | date = 2008 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, not only do men have more influence than women over the storyline and characters of most films but also they have the most influence when it comes to publicly reviewing them. Because most film reviewers are male, androcentric films (films from a masculine viewpoint) may tend to receive more glowing reviews than female-centric films.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A 2009 study conducted by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] analyzed 122 children's films (released between 2006 and 2009) and found both a male bias 'behind the scenes' of the films as well as a male bias in the content of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Smith | first1 = Stacy | last2 = Choueiti | first2 = March | title = Gender on screen and behind the camera in family films: an executive summary | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101223180123/http://www.thegeenadavisinstitute.org/downloads/KeyFindings_GenderDisparityFamilyFilms.pdf | archive-date = 23 December 2010 | url = http://www.thegeenadavisinstitute.org/downloads/KeyFindings_GenderDisparityFamilyFilms.pdf | publisher = [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] |date=23 December 2010 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this sample, 93% of directors, 87% of writers, and 80% of producers were male. Therefore, an androcentric (male) perspective was dominant in most of the films. The report argued that the male dominance behind most of the films was connected to a male bias (an androcentric bias) in the content of the films themselves. For instance, the majority (70.8%) of the speaking characters in these films were also male, and female characters were much more likely than male characters to be portrayed as beautiful. The report argued that "cinematic females are valued more than cinematic males for their looks, youthfulness, and sexy demeanor".

== The arts ==

In 1985 a group of female artists from New York, the [[Guerrilla Girls]], began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled "Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?" They reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guerilla Girls poster 1989 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | archive-date = 25 November 2013 | url = http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | publisher = [[Guerrilla Girls]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Jerry | author-link = Jerry Saltz | title = Where are All the Women?

== Generic male language ==

In literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm', and women, intersex, and non-binary are seen as the 'other'. Some examples are forms of address (such as "Hey guys" or "Dear Sirs") and masculine nouns and pronouns (such as 'mankind', 'man' or 'he') to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argued that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Paul | first = Jennifer | title = Feminist philosophy of language | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/#1.1 | website = plato.stanford.edu | publisher = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online) | date = 2004 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).

Many Latin-based languages in the world are also male-centric. For instance, in Spanish the word ''padres'' (plural of 'father') means 'parents', ''abuelos'' (plural of 'grandfather') means 'grandparents', and ''chicos'' means either 'boys' or 'children'. Pluralized nouns are, if describing a mixed-gender group, assigned male word-endings, pronouns, and adjectives.  This dominance of the masculine grammatical form in formation of the plural is a property also of Italian, Portuguese and French.

Many studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly 'gender-inclusive.'&lt;ref&gt;

Three studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male → people bias but also a people → male bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Mykol C. | title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Masculine bias in the attribution of personhood: people = male, male = people&lt;/nowiki&gt; | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 393&amp;ndash;402 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | date = November 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all.  In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) — females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of "any person" as generic "he," since "he" applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., "he or she") reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., "human").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khosroshahi | first = Fatemeh | title = Penguins don't care, but women do: A social identity analysis of a Whorfian problem | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 505&amp;ndash;525 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500013889 | date = December 1989 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500013889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Who counts as human?

Feminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture and humankind. According to Slocum, "All too often the word 'man' is used in such an ambiguous fashion that it is impossible to decide whether it refers to males or just the human species in general, including both males and females."&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, Sally (2012) [1975], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kou0uQAACAAJ Woman the gatherer: male bias in anthropology]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = McGee | editor-first1 = R. Jon | editor-last2 = Warms | editor-first2 = Richard L. | title = Anthropological theory: an introductory history | pages = 399&amp;ndash;407 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 9780078034886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generic male symbols ==

The default images in Western society for 'man' and for 'human being' are usually the same. For example, the 'walking person' light (that indicates when it is safe for pedestrians to cross the road) looks the same as the symbol for 'man' on the door of a male restroom. The typical symbol for 'woman' looks quite different (with long hair and a triangle body to indicate she is wearing a dress).

On the Internet, many avatars are gender-neutral (such as an image of a smiley face). However, when an avatar is human and discernibly gendered, it usually appears to be male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wade | first = Lisa | title = Default avatars: a collection | url = https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/6281/5883 | work = [[University of Minnesota|The Society Pages]] &amp;#124; Sociological Images | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] | date = 4 May 2009 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Anonymously male: Social media avatar icons are implicitly male and resistant to change | journal = Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | page = 8 | publisher = [[Masaryk University]] | doi = 10.5817/CP2016-4-8 | date = 2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.5817/CP2016-4-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the image of a man (but not that of a woman) is considered to be a normative representation of humankind in general.

== Politics and the law ==

In 2008 Rwanda became the first country in the world to have a female-majority parliament (56% of seats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McCrummen | first = Stephanie | title = Women run the show in a recovering Rwanda | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102602197.html | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 27 October 2008 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2011, Rwanda remains the only country in the world to have a female majority parliament.

==Sports==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Sports media channels such as [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], as well as sports magazines like [[Sports Illustrated]], are assumed to appeal to a predominantly male audience. This is reflected by its advertisers who almost exclusively target men. Men are also most likely to stimulate the sporting economy whether the advertising is targeted non-gender specifically. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}''&lt;!--This statement is not supported by research and data--&gt;analysis.''

'''Aquacultural engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field of [[engineering]] that aims to solve technical problems associated with farming aquatic [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Wheaton|title=Aquacultural Engineering|edition= |publisher=Kreiger Pub Co|year=1933 |page= |isbn= 978-0-8946-4786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include sea cages, [[ponds]], and recirculating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and management of these systems is based on their production goals and the economics of the farming operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colt |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |month= |title=The Role of Engineering Disciplines in Aquaculture|url= |journal=iChemE Symposium Series No. 111 |issn= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–17 |id=|accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquaculture technology is varied with design and development requiring knowledge of mechanical, biological and environmental systems along with [[material engineering]] and [[instrumentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page= |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, engineering techniques often involve solutions borrowed from [[wastewater treatment]], fisheries, and traditional agriculture.

Aquacultural engineering has played a role in the expansion of the aquaculture industry, which now accounts for half of all [[seafood products]] consumed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf|title=2016 The State of the Worlds Fisheries and Aquaculture|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|publisher=United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|page=77|isbn=978-92-5-109185-2|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify effective solutions the discipline is combined with both fish physiology and business economics knowledge.

==Recirculating aquaculture systems==
[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] often involve intensive, high-density culture of a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains a high level of water quality that promotes rapid fish growth.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species.

==Research==
The ''Journal of Aquacultural Engineering'' publishes engineers' studies related to the design and development of aquacultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=Aims &amp; Scope|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405852/description#description|trans_title= |journal=Aquacultural Engineering |issn= 0144-8609|volume= |issue= |pages= |id=|accessdate=2009-08-23 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, universities provide aquacultural engineering education often under the umbrella of agricultural or biological engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">The '''Beutelsbach Consensus''' constitutes a kind of minimum standard of [[Civics|civic]]  (''Politische Bildung'') and [[religious education]] (''Religionsunterricht'') in [[Germany]]. It was developed in the frame of a conference at a small town called [[Beutelsbach (Weinstadt)|Beutelsbach]]  to reanimate the exchange of different didactic schools after a period of deep conflicts. Until today Beutelsbach Consensus is of high importance.

==Main clauses==
=== Prohibition against Overwhelming the Pupil===
It is not permissible to catch pupils unprepared or unaware - by whatever means - for the sake of imparting desirable opinions and to hinder them from `forming an independent judgment’. It is precisely at this point that the dividing line runs between political education and indoctrination. Indoctrination is incompatible with the role of a teacher in a democratic society and the universally accepted objective of making pupils capable of [[Freedom of religion in Germany|independent judgment]] (Mündigkeit).

===Treating Controversial Subjects as Controversial===
Matters which are controversial in intellectual and political affairs must also be taught as controversial in educational instruction. This demand is very closely linked with the first point above, for if differing points of view are lost sight of, options suppressed, and alternatives remain undiscussed, then the path to indoctrination is being trodden. We have to ask whether teachers have in fact a corrective role to play. That is, whether they should or should not specially set out such points of view and alternatives which are foreign to the social and political origins of pupils (and other participants in programs of political education).
In affirming this second basic principle, it becomes clear why the personal standpoint of teachers, the intellectual and theoretical views they represent and their political opinions are relatively uninteresting. To repeat an example that has already been given: their understanding of democracy presents no problems, for opinions contrary to theirs are also being taken into account.

===Giving Weight to the Personal Interests of Pupils===
Pupils must be put in a position to analyse a political situation and to assess how their own personal interests are affected as well as to seek means and ways to influence the political situation they have identified according to their personal interests. Such an objective brings a strong emphasis on the acquisition of the necessary operational skills, which is in turn a logical consequence of the first two principles set out above. In this connection the reproach is sometimes made that this is a `return to formalism’, so that teachers do not have to correct the content of their own beliefs. This is not the case since what is involved here is not a search for a maximum consensus, but the search for a minimal consensus.

[[File:Amazon rain forest2.JPG|thumb|Amazon rain forest biotope]]

A '''biotope''' is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of [[flora (plants)|plants]] and [[fauna (animals)|animals]]. ''Biotope'' is almost synonymous with the term ''[[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]'', which is more commonly used in English-speaking countries. However, in some countries these two terms are distinguished: the subject of a habitat is a [[population]], the subject of a biotope is a ''[[biocoenosis]]'' or ''biological community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si.gunma-u.ac.jp/t/ishikawa/bachlers2003/HoshinoHP/hajimeni.htm Toshiyuki Hoshino. ''Fundamental research in nurtural management of large biotope aiming for regeneration of nature: Introduction''.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is an English [[loanword]] derived from the German ''[[:de:Biotop|Biotop]]'', which in turn came from the Greek ''bios'', "life" and ''topos'', "place". (The related word ''[[geotope]]'' has made its way into the English language by the same route, from the German ''[[:de:Geotop|Geotop]]''.) The word ''biotope'', literally translated, means an "area where life lives".

==Ecology==
The concept of a biotope was first advocated by [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919), a German zoologist famous for the [[recapitulation theory]]. In his book ''General Morphology'' (1866), which defines the term "[[ecology]]", he stresses the importance of the concept of habitat as a prerequisite for an organism's existence. Haeckel also explains that with one ecosystem, its [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is shaped by environmental factors (such as water, soil, and geographical features) and interaction among living things; the original idea of a biotope was closely related to evolutional theory. Following this, F. Dahl, a professor at the Berlin Zoological Museum, referred to this ecological system as a "biotope" (biotop) (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Atushi Iwasawa.(2005). ''Preservation of biotope from zoological view point: Introduction: What is biotope?'', from [http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 The January, 2005, issue of ''Biological Science News''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103645/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |date=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotope restoration==
Although the term "biotope" is considered to be a technical word with respect to ecology, in recent years the term is more generally used in administrative and civic activities. Since the 1970s the term "biotope" has received great attention as a keyword throughout Europe (mainly Germany) for the preservation, regeneration, and creation of natural environmental settings.&lt;ref&gt;''School biotope is a subject matter for environmental and lifelong learning''. Retrieved October 24, 2006, from [http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~fujimiya/biotope1.html Eco Culture Lab Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307144430/http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~fujimiya/biotope1.html |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, the term "biotope" often refers to a smaller and more specific ecology and is very familiar to human life. In Germany especially, activities related to regenerating biotopes are enthusiastically received. These activities include —
* making [[roof garden]]s,
* reconstructing rivers to restore their natural qualities,
* leaving bushes or trees on farms,
* building nature parks along motorways "[[Autobahn]],"
* making school [[garden]]s or [[pond]]s by considering the [[ecosystem]], and
* bearing in mind ecological considerations in private gardens.

Various sectors play a part in these activities, including architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, traffic, agriculture, river engineering, [[limnology]], [[biology]], education, [[landscape gardening]], and domestic gardening. In all fields, all sorts of people are seeking a viable way for humans to respect other living things. The term "biotope" would include a complete environmental approach.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Matsuda.(n.d.) ''What is biotope?'' Retrieved December 10, 2006, from [http://www.tiara.cc/~germany/index_biotope.html Pages of environmental information in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The following four points are the chief characteristics of biotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Shin Mizukoshi.(2005). ''Media Biotope: Characteristics of biotope'', p. 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscale===
A biotope is generally not considered to be a large-scale phenomenon. For example, a biotope might be a neighbouring park, a back garden, even potted plants or a fish tank on a porch. In other words, the biotope is not a macroscopic but a microscopic approach to preserving the ecosystem and biological diversity. So biotopes fit into ordinary people's daily activities and lives, with more people being able to take part in biotope creation and continuing management.

===Biotope networks===
It is commonly emphasised that biotopes should not be isolated. Instead biotopes need to be connected to each other and other surrounding life for without these connections to life-forms such as animals and plants, biotopes would not effectively work as a place in which diverse organisms live. So one of the most effective strategies for regenerating biotopes is to plan a ''stretch'' of biotopes, not just a ''point'' where animals and plants come and go. (Such an organic traffic course is called a [[Wildlife corridor|corridor]].) In the stretch method, the centre of the network would be large green tracts of land: a forest, natural park, or cemetery. By connecting parcels of land with smaller biotope areas such as a green belt along the river, small town parks, gardens, or even roadside trees, biotopes can exist in a network. In other words, a biotope is an open not a closed system and is a practicable strategy.

===Human daily life===
The term "biotope" does not apply to [[biosphere reserves]], which are completely separate from humans and become the object of human admiration. Instead, it is an active part of human daily life. For example, an ornamental flower bed may be considered a biotope (though rather a small one) since it enhances the experience of daily life. An area that has many functions, such as human living space, and is home to other living things, whether plant or animal, can be considered a biosphere reserve.

===Artificial===
When artificial items are introduced to a biotope setting, their design and arrangement is of great importance for biotope regeneration. Tree-planting areas where the surface is uneven results in plants that sprout and the nesting of small insects. A mat or net made from natural fibres will gradually biodegrade as it is exposed to the weather. So there is no binomial opposition between the natural and the artificial in a biotope. Rather, such artificial materials are widely used.

==Germany==
It is especially characteristic in Germany, which is the birthplace of the term biotope, that the authorities take the initiative in conserving biotopes, maintaining consistency with urban or rural planning and considering the regions' history and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103645/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }} Atsushi.I.(2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal basis===
The federal nature protection law ([[Bundesnaturschutzgesetz or BNUM]], since 1976) requires that wild animals and plants and their community should be protected as part of the ecosystem in the specific diversity that has grown naturally and historically, and their biotope and other living conditions should be protected, preserved, developed, and restored. (Number 9, Clause 1, Article 2). The law also requires that some kinds of biotope that are full of a specific variety should not be harmed by development. So there is a law that mandates the protection of biotopes. There is also a provincial law corresponding to the federal one. Such developments were uncommon in those times.

===Landscape plan===
Many German states are obliged by law to produce a landscape plan ([[Landschaftsplan]]) as part of their urban planning, though these plans vary somewhat from place to place. The purpose of the "Landschaftsplan" is to protect the region's environment and landscape. These plans use text and figures to describe the present environmental state and proposed remedies. They consider, for example, the regional lie of the land, climate, wind direction, soil, ground water, type of biotope, distribution of animals and plants, inhabitants' welfare and competition with development projects.

===Citizen welfare===
Biotope preservation in cities also emphasises recreation and relaxation for citizens and improving the urban environment. For example, in the reserve of [[Karlsruhe]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]] people can cycle on the bike path or walk the dog, although it is forbidden to gather plants and animals there or walk in the exclusion zone. At the core of biotope preservation is the idea that if civic life is surrounded by a rich profusion of nature whose background is in local history and culture, it is improved by protecting nature and preserving the landscape.

==Aquaria==
The term "biotope" is also used by [[aquarium]] hobbyists to describe an [[aquascaping|aquarium setup]] that tries to simulate the natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] of specific fish. The idea is to replicate conditions such as water parameters, natural plants, water type ([[Freshwater aquarium|fresh]], [[Marine aquarium|saline]] or [[Brackish-water aquarium|brackish]]), lighting, and to include other native fish which usually live together in nature and as such, represent a particular real-world biotope. An example of one [[South American]] biotope type might be lots of [[bog-wood]], a few native plants, dark substrata and subdued lighting with floating plants, along with [[Marbled hatchetfish|marbled hatchets]], [[Pterophyllum|angels]], [[Cardinal tetra|cardinals]], [[Otocinclus|otos]], [[Corydoras|corys]] and [[Hypostomus plecostomus|plecostomus]].

The '''Bohdan Dobrzański Institute of Agrophysics''' of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] ('''IA PAS''', Instytut Agrofizyki im. Bohdana Dobrzańskiego Polskiej Akademii Nauk, IA PAN) is a public research and higher education institution dedicated to the study of [[agrophysics]],
agricultural sciences and research on physical problems of agriculture.  The Institute publishes two English-language scientific journals, the quarterly ''Acta Agrophysica'' (since 1993) and the semi-annual ''Polish Journal of Soil Science'' (since 1968).

The Institute promotes agrophysics as a part of agricultural sciences that uses knowledge and methods of basic sciences such as physics, biology and chemistry for solving contemporary problems in agronomy. It develops new methods, experimental and numerical tools, products, and technological and service innovations for agriculture and for exploitation of the agricultural resources.

The Institute is funded by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. 
It is located in [[Lublin]], [[Poland]].   Its email addresses include sekretariat@ipan.lublin.pl and agrof@demeter.ipan.lublin.pl.
Its telephone numbers include (48 81) 744 50 61 (to 66), and its facsimile line is (48 81) 744 50 67.

== Mission ==
The Institute's mission&lt;ref name=IAPAS&gt;[http://www.ipan.lublin.pl/ Institute of Agrophysics website (in Polish and English)]&lt;/ref&gt; addresses 
* Research and development in agricultural sciences (agricultural environment, agri-food biomaterials, bio-energy) and dissemination of achieved results,
* Education of research staff for industry and science in order to make them capable of solving contemporary problems of agriculture and developing bio-economy, and
* Cooperation and participation in inter- and trans-disciplinary collaborations with researchers, industry and public actors for ensuring sustainable exploitation of agricultural resources, and therefore, contributing to regional, European and world-wide bio-economy.

== Research and Development ==
Research and development at the Institute is both inter- and trans-disciplinary, involving the soil-plant-atmosphere system and distributed in three areas:&lt;ref name=IAPAS /&gt;
* Agricultural Environment, including ensuring sustainable management and exploitation of the soil-plant-atmosphere system, development of new climate services and prediction of climate change, and mitigation of the impact of agriculture on climate change,
* Agri-Food Biomaterials, including ensuring sustainable food security, exploitation of agri-food biomaterials for designing new food and non-food products, and waste valorization, and
* Bio-Energy, including sustainable exploitation of agri-food biomass for bio-energy production, and optimization processes in production of bio-energy.

== History ==
The Institute was founded in 1968 by Professor [[Bohdan Dobrzański]], [[Polish Academy of Sciences|PAS]], who was its director until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speciation.net/Database/Companies/Institute-of-Agrophysics-PAS-Polish-Academy-of-Science-in-Lublin/-;i1871a-1 EVISA Company Database]&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally with the rank of a basic research institution, in 1986 it was elevated to the full rank of an Institute in the structure of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1990 the Institute was named after its founder. In 1989 the Institute was awarded the right to confer the degree of PhD, and in 1992 the degree of DSc in the field of agronomy-agrophysics. In 1998 the Institute became a legal entity and was entered in the Register of Institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

'''Carmine Benincasa''' (born 17 December 1947 in [[Eboli]]) is an Italian art critic and [[Art History|art historian]] professor.

== Biography ==
'''Carmine Benincasa''' was born in [[Eboli]] in the south of Italy. After studying in a religious school he moved to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

He was a professor of art history at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Macerata]], the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Florence]] and Professor of History of Art at the [[Faculty of Architecture]] of the [[University La Sapienza]] in Rome. During this period he met intellectuals like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]],&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0357919&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Bruno Zevi]] and many more.

From 1978 to 1982 he was a member of the [[Venice Biennale]] Visual Arts Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/10/16/biennale-il-psi-fa-incetta-di-poltrone.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Environment. In 1994 he was briefly accused and incarcerated for defrauding collectors by validating and selling false artworks.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/07/08/critico-arte-professore-in-cella-per.html&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently thrown out of court for lack of evidence. Benincasa was eventually cleared of every wrongdoing by the [[Supreme Court of Italy]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id%3D239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804000431/http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id=239 |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benincasa has published numerous essays, articles and monographs on artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Mario Ceroli]], [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Joan Mirò]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Giorgio Morandi]]. He has also organized many international exhibitions, including a section of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982.

Benincasa is currently chief editor of the Italian edition of ''[[Cahiers d'Art]]''.

The '''Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri''' or simply the '''Chester Beatty Papyri''' are a group of early [[papyrus]] [[Biblical manuscript|manuscripts of biblical texts]]. The manuscripts are in Greek and are of Christian origin. There are eleven manuscripts in the group, seven consisting of portions of Old Testament books, three consisting of portions of the New Testament (Gregory-Aland no. [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 46|P&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;]], and [[Papyrus 47|P&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one consisting of portions of the [[Book of Enoch]] and an unidentified Christian homily. Most are dated to the 3rd century. They are housed in part at the [[Chester Beatty Library]] in Dublin, Ireland, and in part at the [[University of Michigan]], among a few other locations.

The papyri were most likely first obtained by dealers in [[illegal antiquities]]. Because of this, the exact circumstances of the find are not clear. One account is that the manuscripts were in jars in a Coptic graveyard near the ruins of the ancient city of [[Atfih|Aphroditopolis]]. Other theories have proposed that the collection was found near [[Al Fayyum|the Fayum]] instead of Aphroditopolis, or that the location was a Christian church or monastery instead of a graveyard. Most of the papyri were bought from a dealer by [[Alfred Chester Beatty]], after whom the manuscripts are named, although some leaves and fragments were acquired by the [[University of Michigan]] and a few other collectors and institutions.

The papyri were first announced on November 19, 1931, although more leaves were acquired over the next decade. [[Frederic G. Kenyon]] published the manuscripts in ''The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri: Descriptions and Texts of Twelve Manuscripts on Papyrus of the Greek Bible'', in an 8-volume work that spanned 1933-58. The papyri are usually cataloged as ''P. Chester Beatty'' followed by a corresponding Roman numeral between I-XII, one for each manuscript.

The term '''"Chester Beatty Papyri"''' can also generally refer to the collection of manuscripts that Alfred Chester Beatty acquired over his lifetime, which include non-Biblical papyri such as the [[Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus]].

== Character of the collection ==

All of the manuscripts are [[codex|codices]], which was surprising to the first scholars who examined the texts because it was believed that the papyrus codex was not extensively used by Christians until the 4th century. Most of the manuscripts dated to the 3rd century, with some as early as the 2nd. The manuscripts also helped scholars understand the construction of papyrus codices. There is significant variation between the construction of each manuscript. Page size ranges from about 14 by 24.2&amp;nbsp;cm (P. III) to 18 by 33&amp;nbsp;cm (P. VI). Some of the manuscripts were constructed of a single gathering (quire) of papyrus sheets (Pap. II, VII, IX + X), while in others the gathering varies from a single sheet (I) to five (V) or seven (VII). The largest codex (P. IX/X) is believed to have contained roughly 236 pages.

The manuscripts employ ''[[nomina sacra]]''. One notable example is in P. VI which contains portions of the Old Testament. The name Joshua which relates linguistically to Jesus was considered a sacred name and abbreviated as such.

Since all but two (P. XI, XII) of the eleven manuscripts are dated before the 4th century, they present significant [[textual criticism|textual]] evidence for the Greek Bible as it existed in Egypt prior to the Diocletianic persecutions where Christian books are said to have been destroyed and a century or more earlier than the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Although some of the scholars who first studied the collection considered some of the New Testament manuscripts, especially ''P. Chester Beatty'' I (P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;) to be of the [[Caesarean text-type]], this has little support today. The textual character is generally described as being eclectic, mixed, or unaligned. The manuscripts provided many new textual variations, especially because the Old Testament manuscripts predated the revision activity of [[Lucian]] and [[Origen]] and others, and the New Testament manuscripts are some of the earliest yet quite extensive examples of the corresponding books.

== Old Testament manuscripts ==

Originally, there were believed to be eight manuscripts in the Chester Beatty collection that contained portions of the Old Testament. However, what was believed to be two different manuscripts actually belonged to the same codex, resulting in a total of seven Old Testament manuscripts in the collection, all following the text of the [[Septuagint]].

* P. IV and V – Two manuscripts that contain portions of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], one dated to the late 3rd century, and one the early 4th century. These manuscripts are significant because the next oldest Greek Old Testament texts of Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have extensive [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in Genesis.
* P. VI – A manuscript of the [[Book of Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]], consisting of around 50 partial leaves out of 108 and many very small fragments, dated to the first half of the 2nd century. It is the earliest manuscript in the collection, but is predated by two other less extensive Greek papyri manuscripts of these books, [[Papyrus Fouad 266|''P. Fouad'' 266]] and ''[[Papyrus Rylands 458|P. Rylands 458]]''.
* P. VII – A manuscript of the [[Book of Isaiah]], heavily deteriorated, with Coptic (Old Fayumic) marginal notes, dated to the 3rd century. 
* P. VIII – Two fragmentary leaves from the [[Book of Jeremiah]], ''c.'' 200
* P. IX/X – A manuscript of the Books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and [[Book of Esther|Esther]], dated to the 3rd century. What remains is 50 out of an original 118 leaves, 29 of which are in the Chester Beatty Library (8 of Ezekiel, 8 of Esther, and 13 of Daniel), and another 21 (of Ezekiel) are in the [[Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library|Princeton University Library]]. The bottom portions of the leaves are missing. Nonetheless, all parts of the manuscript are the most substantial, early examples of the corresponding books of the Bible. Ezekiel is written in a different handwriting than the other two books. Daniel was originally counted as P. X, because it was mistakenly thought to be a separate manuscript. It was later decided that all three books belong to a single codex. Daniel contains some significant variations regarding the order and omission of certain parts of the text (chapters 7-8 come before 5-6, and parts of chapters 4 and 5 are missing). 
* P. XI – Two fragmentary leaves from [[Ecclesiastes]], dated to the 4th century.

== New Testament manuscripts ==
{{main|Papyrus 45|Papyrus 46}}
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|A folio from P46 containing 2 Corinthians 11:33-12:9]]

There are three New Testament manuscripts that are part of the Chester Beatty Papyri. The first, P. I, is labeled under the Gregory-Aland numbering system as [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]] and was originally a codex of 110 leaves that contained the four canonical gospels and Acts. 30 fragmentary leaves remain, consisting of two small leaves of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] chapters 20/21 and 25/26, portions of the [[Gospel of Mark]] chapters 4-9, 11-12, portions of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 6-7, 9-14, portions of the [[Gospel of John]] 4-5, 10-11, and portion of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 4-17. The ordering of the gospels follows the Western tradition, Matthew, John, Luke, Mark, Acts. These fragments are [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] dated to the first half of the 3rd century.

[[Papyrus 46|P&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;]] is the second New Testament manuscript in the Chester Beatty collection (P. II), and was a codex that contained the [[Pauline Epistles]] dating ''c.'' 200.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} What remains today of the manuscript is roughly 85 out of 104 leaves consisting of Romans chapters 5-6, 8-15, all of Hebrews, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians 1-2, 5. The leaves have partially deteriorated, resulting in the loss of some lines at the bottom of each folio. The manuscript split up between the [[Chester Beatty Library]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. Scholars do not believe the [[Pastoral epistles]] were included originally in the codex, based on the amount of space required in the missing leaves; they conclude 2 Thessalonians would have occupied the final portion of the codex. The inclusion of Hebrews, a book that was questioned canonically and not considered [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|authored by Paul]], is notable. The placement of it following Romans is unique against most other witnesses, as is the ordering of Galatians following Ephesians.

P. III is the last New Testament manuscript, P&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;, and contains 10 leaves from the [[Book of Revelation]], chapters 9-17. This manuscript also dates to the 3rd century, and Kenyon describes the handwriting as being rough.

== Apocrypha manuscript ==

The last manuscript in the Chester Beatty Papyri, XII, contains chapters 97-107 of the [[Book of Enoch]] and portions of an unknown Christian homily attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]]. The manuscript is placed in the 4th century. The Book of Enoch is listed as "The Epistle of Enoch" in the manuscript. Chapters 105 and 108 are not included, and scholars believe they were later additions. XII is the only Greek witness to certain parts of Enoch. As for the homily, XII was the only known copy of the text at the time of its discovery. Two manuscripts which contain the text, ''[[Bodmer Papyri|P. Bodmer]]'' XIII and ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P. Oxy.]]'' 1600, have since been found. The manuscript also contains the only manuscript witness to the [[Apocryphon of Ezekiel]], although it is cited by [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Paedagogus'' I. ix. 84.2–4). Overall, the handwriting is rough and most likely from a scribe who did not know Greek well. Campbell Bonner of the University of Michigan published this manuscript in his 1937 ''The Last Chapters of Enoch in Greek'' and 1940 ''The Homily on the Passion by Melito Bishop of Sardis''. {{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">'''Classical reception studies''' is the study of how the [[Classics|Classical world]], especially [[Ancient Greek literature]] and [[Latin literature]], have been received since antiquity. Influenced by [[reception theory]], it departs from the [[Classical tradition]] in various ways.

==Definition==
[[Lorna Hardwick]] and [[Christopher Stray]] assert that Classical reception studies is devoted to examining "the ways in which Greek and Roman material has been transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, rewritten, re-imaged and represented".{{sfn|Hardwick|Stray|2008|p=1}} Martindale notes that Classical reception "encompasses all work concerned with postclassical material".{{sfn|Martindale|2006|p=1}}

Hardwick and Stray state that scholars of reception studies hold the relationship between the ancient and modern to be reciprocal, although they acknowledge that others believe that reception studies only shed light on the receiving society, and not on the ancient text or its context.{{sfn|Hardwick|Stray|2008|p=4}}

{{For|the book by James McBride|The Color of Water}}
[[File:Strawberry splash.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=a glass of transparent water sitting on a wooden table|When water is in small quantities (e.g. in a glass) it appears [[wikt:colorless|colorless]] to the [[human eye]]]]
The '''color of water''' varies with the ambient conditions in which that water is present. While relatively small quantities of [[water]] appear to be [[Transparency and translucency|colorless]], pure water has a slight [[blue]] [[color]] that becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases. The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective [[Electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of white light. Dissolved [[chemical elements|elements]] or suspended impurities may give water a different color.

==Intrinsic colour==
[[File:SwimmingPoolAndBucket.jpg|thumb|right|An indoor swimming pool appears blue from above. as light reflecting from the bottom of the pool travels through enough water that its red component is absorbed. The same water in a smaller bucket looks only slightly blue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=Jim |last2=Milligan |first2=Mark |year=2011 |title=Why is Bear Lake So Blue? |series=Public Information Series |volume=96 |publisher=[[Utah Geological Survey]] |url=http://geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123163847/http://www.geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |isbn=978-1-55791-842-0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing the water at close range makes it appear colourless to the human eye.]]
The intrinsic colour of liquid water may be demonstrated by looking at a white light source through a long pipe that is filled with purified water and closed at both ends with a transparent window. The light [[Turquoise (colour)|turquoise]] blue colour is caused by weak [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] in the red part of the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{Citation |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |last2=Smirnov |first2=Sergei N. |year=1993 |title=Why is water blue? |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=70 |issue=8 |pages=612–614 |url=http://inside.mines.edu/fs_home/dwu/classes/CH353/study/Why%20is%20Water%20Blue.pdf |doi=10.1021/ed070p612|bibcode = 1993JChEd..70..612B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |author2=Fry |title=Absorption spectrum (380-700nm) of pure water. II.

Absorptions in the visible spectrum are usually attributed to excitations of [[Electron configuration|electronic]] energy states in matter. Water is a simple three-atom [[molecule]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and all its electronic absorptions occur in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and are therefore not responsible for the colour of water in the visible region of the spectrum. The water molecule has three fundamental modes of [[molecular vibrations|vibration]]. Two stretching vibrations of the O-H [[Chemical bond|bond]]s in the gaseous state of water occur at v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3755&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Absorption due to these vibrations occurs in the [[infrared]] region of the spectrum. The absorption in the visible spectrum is due mainly to the [[harmonic]] v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 14,318&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equivalent to a wavelength of 698&amp;nbsp;nm. In liquid state at 20°C these vibrations are red-shifted due to hydrogen bonding, resulting in red absorption at 740&amp;nbsp;nm, other harmonics such as v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; giving red absorption at 660&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The absorption curve for heavy water (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is of a similar shape, but is shifted further towards the infrared end of the spectrum, because the vibrational transitions have a lower energy. For this reason, heavy water does not absorb red light and thus large bodies of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O would lack the characteristic blue colour of the more commonly-found light water (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name="Webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |title=Colours from Vibration |author=WebExhibits |work=Causes of Colour |publisher=[[WebExhibits]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212434/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |archivedate=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-10-21 |quote=Heavy water is colourless because all of its corresponding vibrational transitions are shifted to lower energy (higher wavelength) by the increase in isotope mass. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorption intensity decreases markedly with each successive overtone, resulting in very weak absorption for the third overtone. For this reason, the pipe needs to have a length of a meter or more and the water must be purified by [[microfiltration]] to remove any particles that could produce [[Mie scattering]].

==Color of lakes and oceans==
[[File:Ireland-AtlanticOceanwithAranIsland.jpg|thumb|left|Large bodies of water such as oceans manifest water's inherent blue color.]]
Lakes and oceans appear blue for several reasons.  One is that the surface of the water reflects the color of the sky. While this reflection contributes to the observed color, it is not the sole reason.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=612|ps=:"...any simple answer is bound to mislead.  It turns out that contributions to the observed color are made both by reflected skylight and by the intrinsic absorption."}}

Some of the light hitting the surface of ocean is reflected but most of it penetrates the water surface, interacting with its molecules. The water molecule can vibrate in three different modes when irradiated by light. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so the remaining light seen is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets. This is the main reason the [[ocean color|ocean's color]] is blue.

Some constituents of sea water can influence the shade of blue of the ocean. This is why it can look greener or bluer in different areas. Water in swimming pools (which may also contain various chemicals) with white-painted sides and bottom will appear as a turquoise blue.

Clean water appears blue in white-tiled swimming pools as well as in indoor pools where there is no blue sky to be reflected. The deeper the pool, the bluer the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |last=Rossing |first=Thomas D. |last2=Chiaverina |first2=Christopher J. |date=1999 |title=Light science: physics and the visual arts |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-0-387-98827-6 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Scattering from suspended particles also plays an important role in the color of lakes and oceans.  A few tens of meters of water will absorb all light, so without scattering, all bodies of water would appear black. Because most lakes and oceans contain suspended living matter and mineral particles, known as [[colored dissolved organic matter]] (CDOM), light from above is reflected upwards. Scattering from suspended particles would normally give a white color, as with snow, but because the light first passes through many meters of blue-colored liquid, the scattered light appears blue. In extremely pure water—as is found in mountain lakes, where scattering from white-colored particles is missing—the scattering from water molecules themselves also contributes a blue color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[File:Ocean color 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The hue of the reflected sky also contributes to the perceived color of water.]]
Another phenomenon that occurs is [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the [[atmosphere]] along one's line of sight: the [[horizon]] is typically 4–5&amp;nbsp;km distant and the air (being just above [[sea level]] in the case of the ocean) is at its [[Density of air|densest]].  This mechanism would add a blue tinge to any distant object (not just the sea) because blue light would be scattered into one's line of sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The surfaces of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight, making them appear bluer. The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=613 |ps=:"...the relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle." }}

==Color of glaciers==
{{Main article|Blue ice (glacial)}}

[[Glacier]]s are large bodies of [[ice]] and [[snow]] formed in [[Ice age|cold climates]] by processes involving the compaction of fallen snow. While snowy glaciers appear white from a distance, up close and when shielded from direct ambient light, glaciers usually appear a deep blue due to the long path lengths of the internal reflected light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Relatively small amounts of regular ice appear white because plenty of air bubbles are present, and also because small quantities of water appear to be colorless.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In glaciers, on the other hand, the pressure causes the air bubbles, trapped in the accumulated snow, to be squeezed out increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear blue, therefore a large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, would also appear blue.

==Color of water samples==
[[File:Havasu Falls 2 md.jpg|thumb|right|High concentrations of dissolved [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] give the water of [[Havasu Falls]] a turquoise color.]]
Dissolved and particulate material in water can cause discoloration. Slight discoloration is measured in Hazen units (HU).&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization, ISO 2211:1973, ''Measurement of colour in Hazen units (platinum-cobalt scale) of Liquid Chemical Products''&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities can be deeply colored as well, for instance dissolved [[organic compound]]s called [[tannin-stained waters|tannin]]s can result in dark brown colors, or [[algae]] floating in the water (particles) can impart a green color.

The color of a water sample can be reported as:
* ''Apparent color'' is the color of the whole water sample, and consists of color from both [[Solution|dissolved]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] components.
* ''True color'' is measured after filtering the water sample to remove all suspended material.

Testing for color can be a quick and easy test which often reflects the amount of organic material in the water, although certain inorganic components like iron or manganese can also impart color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Water color can reveal physical, chemical and bacteriological conditions. In drinking water, green can indicate copper leaching from copper plumbing and can also represent algae growth. Blue can also indicate copper, or might be caused by syphoning of industrial cleaners in the tank of commodes, commonly known as backflowing. Reds can be signs of rust from iron pipes or airborne bacteria from lakes, etc. Black water can indicate growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria inside a hot water tank set to too low a temperature. This usually has a strong sulfur or rotten egg (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) odor and is easily corrected by draining the water heater and increasing the temperature to {{convert|49|C|F}} or higher.  The odor will always be in the hot water pipes if sulfate reducing bacteria are the cause and never in the cold water plumbing.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The color spectrum with water indicators{{clarify|date=July 2012}} is wide and, if learned, can make identifying and solving cosmetic, bacteriological and chemical problems easier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Water quality and color==
[[File:Lake Pukaki and neighbours - STS088-721-15.jpg|thumb|left|Glacial [[rock flour]] makes New Zealand's [[Lake Pukaki]] a lighter turquoise than its neighbors.]]
The presence of color in water does not necessarily indicate that the water is not [[drinking water|drinkable]]. Color-causing substances such as [[tannin-stained waters|tannins]] may be harmless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Color is not removed by typical [[water filter]]s; however, [[slow sand filter]]s can remove color, and the use of [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulants]] may also succeed in trapping the color-causing compounds within the resulting [[precipitate]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Other factors can affect the color seen:
*Particles and solutes can absorb light, as in tea or coffee. Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color. The Red Sea has occasional blooms of red ''[[Trichodesmium|Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' algae.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
*Particles in water can scatter light.  The Colorado River is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water. Some mountain lakes and streams with finely ground rock, such as [[rock flour|glacial flour]], are turquoise.  Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water's absorption can return to the surface and be observed.  Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green, a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Color names==
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|Red tide off the California coast]]
Various cultures divide the [[semantic field]] of colors differently from the English language usage and some do not [[blue-green across cultures|distinguish between blue and green]] in the same way. An example is Welsh where ''glas'' can mean blue or green.

Other color names assigned to bodies of water are [[sea green]] and [[ultramarine]] blue. Unusual oceanic colorings have given rise to the terms [[red tide]] and [[oil spill|black tide]].

The Ancient Greek poet [[Homer]] uses the [[epithet]] "wine-dark sea"; in addition, he also describes the sea as "grey". [[Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age|William Ewart Gladstone]] has suggested that this is due to the [[Ancient Greek]]s classifying colors primarily by luminosity rather than hue, while others believe Homer was color-blind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}{{Portal|Water}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Croatian National Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski nacionalni korpus}}, ''HNK'') is the biggest and the most important corpus of the [[Croatian language]]. Its compilation started in 1998 at the Institute of Linguistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffzg.hr/zzl Institute of Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], [[University of Zagreb]] following the ideas of  [http://hnk.ffzg.hr/mt Marko Tadić]. The theoretical foundations and the expression of the need for a general-purpose, representative and multi-million corpus of the Croatian language started to appear even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Tadić 1990, [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk.pdf 1996], [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk2.pdf 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian National Corpus is compiled from selected texts written in Croatian covering all fields, topics, genres and styles: from literary and scientific texts to text-books, newspaper, user-groups and chat rooms.

The initial composition was divided in two constituents:
# ''30-million corpus of contemporary Croatian language'' (30m) where samples from texts from 1990 on were included. The criteria for inclusion of text samples were: written by native speakers, different fields, genres and topics. Translated text or poetry were excluded.
# ''Croatian Electronic Text Archive'' (HETA) where the complete text were included, particularly serial publications (volumes, series, editions etc.) which would imbalance the 30m if they were inserted there.

Since 2004, with the adoption of the concept of the 3rd generation corpus, the two-constituent structure has been abandoned in favor of several subcorpora and larger size. Since 2005 HNK 105 million tokens and is composed of number of different subcorpora which can be searched individually and all together in a whole corpus. Since 2004 HNK also migrated to a new server platform, namely Manatee/Bonito server-client architecture. For searching the HNK (today still with free test access) a free client program Bonito&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textforge.cz Bonito]&lt;/ref&gt; is needed.

'''Deane Keller''' (December 14, 1901 &amp;ndash; April 12, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[academic]], [[soldier]], [[art restorer]] and [[preservationist]]. He taught for forty years at [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Art|School of Fine Arts]] and during [[World War II]] was an officer with the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]].

==Biography==
Keller was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Deane Keller, Painter And Art Teacher, 91 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 April 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/17/obituaries/deane-keller-painter-and-art-teacher-91.html  |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Albert Galloway Keller]], was a member of the junior faculty at Yale; but during young Deane's formative years, his father would become the first [[William Graham Sumner]] Professor of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Albert G.

As a student at Yale, he earned degrees in history and science in 1923.  Further studies led to a B.F.A. from the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; Keller was awarded the [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |title=Two Get Awards in Art Competition; Grand Prix de Rome Fellowships Go to Deane Keller and Joseph Kissilewski |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 May 1926 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/05/05/archives/two-get-awards-in-art-competition-grand-prix-de-rome-fellowships-go.html |accessdate=28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Fellow of  the [[American Academy in Rome]] (FAAR) for three years.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; After returning from Rome in 1929, Keller began his career as a member of the Yale faculty.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.1685  |title=Deane Keller papers |website=Yale University Manuscripts and Archives |publisher=Yale University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career was interrupted by the Second World War, when he was asked by School of Fine Arts dean [[Theodore Sizer (art historian)|Theodore Sizer]] to serve as a fine arts officer in the U.S. Army's [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]]. At war's end, he returned to teach at Yale's School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt; In total, Keller taught at Yale for forty years, retiring in 1979, and was also professor emeritus of painting at the [[Paier College of Art]].&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

Keller married Katherine Parkhurst Hall in 1938. He had two sons, [[Deane G. Keller]], 1940 – 2005, and William Keller, born in 1950.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:Deane Keller with Cosimo I de Medici statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Keller with the head of the Cosimo I de Medici statue, recovered in [[Poggio a Caiano]], Italy]]
From 1943 to 1946, Keller served as an officer of the U.S. 5th Army in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Keller, Capt. Deane |publisher=Monuments Men Foundation |url=http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/ |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Keller was primarily responsible for the identification and transportation of artworks in [[Tuscany, Italy]], the center of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and a major site of [[Nazi plunder|Nazi looting]].&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roach"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roach |first=Catherine |title=Collateral Damage |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=March 2003 |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/03_03/keller.html |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[Pisa, Italy|Pisa]] and [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where Nazi troops had bombed churches, destroyed or dislocated public art, and seized paintings from museums including the [[Uffizi]].&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt; As they were discovered during the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]], Keller repatriated lost works, including [[Giambologna]]'s statue of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de Medici]], a fixture of  Florence's [[Piazza della Signoria]]. He also documented damage to buildings and murals across Tuscany, taking thousands of photographs with Charles Bernholz.&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt;

One of Keller's most significant wartime undertakings was his attempt to preserve the murals of the [[Camposanto]], a medieval cemetery in Pisa. In July 1944, an American shelling started a fire that caused the frescoes to fracture.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Keller organized art experts and enlisted men to protect the mural pieces and protect the cemetery from further damage.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Restoration of the frescoes has continued for seventy years.  In recognition of his preservation efforts, an urn containing Keller's ashes was interred in the Camposanto in 2000.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;

==Honors==
* [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]], 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"/&gt;
* [[Legion of Merit]], 1946 (United States).
* [[British Empire Medal]], 1926 (United Kingdom).
* [[Crown of Italy Partisan Medal]], 1946 (Italy).
* [[Medal of the Opera]], Commune of Pisa
* [[Order of St John Lateran]], 1946. (Vatican).

Keller was posthumously recognized for his wartime activities. He was the first to enter Pisa liberated from Nazi, 02 Sept.1944, with the partisan Pierino Fornaciari, liaison officer, with whom he rescued many art works, in particular in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]]. His remains were apportioned and interred in New Britain, Connecticut and the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] in [[Pisa]]; that site is identified with an engraved marble slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| author-last1=Berge |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Cohen |author-first2=Bonni |author-last3=Newnham |author-first3=Nicole |title=The Rape of Europa |date=2006 |medium=film |publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting |url=https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his academic career, Keller was a prolific portrait painter. He was known as the "unofficial portraitist of the Yale faculty," completing over 160 portrait commissions for the university, including faculty, corporation board members, and two presidents. With one of his portrait subjects, [[Thomas G. Bergin]], Keller worked in collaboration by illustrating the book, ''On Sepulchers''.&lt;ref&gt;Foscolo, Ugo. Bergin, Thomas G., translator. Keller, Deane, illustrator. ''On Sepulchers''. The Bethany Press. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Portraits for clients outside these Yale commissions included Senator [[Robert A.

'''Demographic transition''' ('''DT''') is the transition from high [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[death rate]]s to lower birth and death rates as a country or region develops from a pre-industrial to an [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] [[economic system]]. The theory was proposed in 1929 by the American [[demography|demographer]] Warren Thompson,&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Warren Thompson|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Population| volume = 2|pages=939–40|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-02-865677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who observed changes, or transitions, in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the previous 200 years.  Most [[developed countries]] have completed the demographic transition and have low birth rates; most [[developing countries]] are in the process of this transition.&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=John C.|author2=Bruce K Caldwell |author3=Pat Caldwell |author4=Peter F McDonald |author5=Thomas Schindlmayr |title=Demographic Transition Theory|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year= 2006 |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-4373-4 | page = 239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = About | title = Geography | url = http://geography.about.com/od/culturalgeography/a/demotransition.htm | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major (relative) exceptions are some poor countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and some [[Middle Eastern]] countries, which are poor or affected by government policy or civil strife, notably, Pakistan, [[Palestinian territories]], [[Yemen]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell /&gt;

The demographic transition model, in isolation, can be taken to predict that birth rates will continue to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however, recent data contradicts this, suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08230|pmid=19661915|title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines|journal=Nature|volume=460|issue=7256|pages=741–3|year=2009|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|last2=Kohler|first2=Hans-Peter|last3=Billari|first3=Francesco C.|bibcode=2009Natur.460..741M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the very long term, the demographic transition should be reversed via [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher [[Birth rate|fertility]] and higher [[death rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=bbc_sure&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19923200 Can we be sure the world's population will stop rising?], BBC News, 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of some kind of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical [[correlation]] linking dropping fertility to social and economic development.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes [[Causation (sociology)|lead to]] lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher [[per capita]] income, higher female income, lower mortality, old-age security, and rise of demand for human capital are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galor|first1=Oded|title=The demographic transition: causes and consequences|journal=Cliometrica|date=17 February 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1007/s11698-011-0062-7|pmid=25089157|pmc=4116081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the theory==
The theory is based on an interpretation of [[demography|demographic]] history developed in 1929 by the American demographer Warren Thompson (1887–1973).&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll /&gt; [[Adolphe Landry]] of France made similar observations on demographic patterns and population growth potential around 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landry|first1=Adolphe|title=Adolphe Landry on the Demographic Revolution|journal=Population and Development Review|date=December 1987|volume=13|issue=4|pages=731|doi=10.2307/1973031|jstor=1973031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s [[Frank W. Notestein]] developed a more formal theory of demographic transition.&lt;ref name="Woods2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Robert|title=The Demography of Victorian England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75DZmQtybMwC&amp;pg=PA18|date=2000-10-05|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78254-8|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the existence of a negative correlation between fertility and industrial development had become one of the most widely accepted findings in social science.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

==Summary of the theory==
[[File:Demographic-Transition-5-countries.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic change in Germany, Sweden, Chile, Mauritius, China from 1820 to 2010.&lt;br /&gt;Pink line: crude [[death rate]] (CDR), green line: (crude) [[birth rate]] (CBR), yellow line: population.]]

The transition involves four stages, or possibly five.

* In stage one, [[pre-industrial society ]], death rates and birth rates are high and roughly in balance. All human populations are believed to have had this balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe.&lt;ref name= "marathon.uwc.edu"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | publisher = UWC | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% at least since the Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* In stage two, that of a developing country, the death rates drop quickly due to improvements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and reduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective breeding and crop rotation and farming techniques.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Other improvements generally include access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous improvements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Prior to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily in the areas of food handling, water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; One of the variables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health education programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; In Europe, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern Europe and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Without a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an [[Demographic trap|imbalance]], and the countries in this stage experience a large increase in [[population]].
* In stage three, birth rates fall due to various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] such as access to [[contraception]], increases in wages, [[urbanization]], a reduction in [[subsistence agriculture]], an increase in the status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes.  Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, it should be noted that contraceptives were not generally available nor widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; not just because of the availability of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* During stage four there are both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may drop to well below replacement level as has happened in countries like [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]], leading to a [[population decline|shrinking population]], a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high [[obesity]] and an aging population in [[developed countries]]. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"/&gt;
* Some scholars break out, from stage four, a "stage five" of below-replacement fertility levels. Others hypothesize a different "stage five" involving an increase in fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure/&gt;

As with all models, this is an idealized picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. The extent to which it applies to less-developed societies today remains to be seen. Many countries such as [[China]], [[Brazil]] and [[Thailand]] have passed through the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic change. Some countries, particularly African countries, appear to be stalled in the second stage due to stagnant development and the effect of [[AIDS]].

==Stage One==
In pre-industrial society, death rates and birth rates were both high, and fluctuated rapidly according to natural events, such as drought and disease, to produce a relatively constant and young population. Family planning and contraception were virtually nonexistent; therefore, birth rates were essentially only limited by the ability of women to bear children. Emigration depressed death rates in some special cases (for example, Europe and particularly the Eastern United States during the 19th century), but, overall, death rates tended to match birth rates, often exceeding 40 per 1000 per year. Children contributed to the economy of the household from an early age by carrying water, firewood, and messages, caring for younger siblings, sweeping, washing dishes,  preparing food, and working in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/DemographicTransition.htm|title=Demographic Transition Model|website=geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising a child cost little more than feeding him or her; there were no education or entertainment expenses.  Thus, the total [[Cost of raising a child|cost of raising children]] barely exceeded their contribution to the household.  In addition, as they became adults they become a major input to the family business, mainly farming, and were the primary form of insurance for adults in old age.  In India, an adult son was all that prevented a widow from falling into destitution.  While death rates remained high there was no question as to the need for children, even if the means to prevent them had existed.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During this stage, the society evolves in accordance with [[Malthusian growth model|Malthusian]] paradigm, with population essentially determined by the food supply. Any fluctuations in food supply (either positive, for example, due to technology improvements, or negative, due to droughts and pest invasions) tend to translate directly into population fluctuations. [[Famine]]s resulting in significant mortality are frequent. Overall, [[population dynamics]] during stage one are comparable to those of animals living in the wild. According to Edward, Revocatus. (2016) This is the earlier stage of demographic transition in the world and also characterized by primary activities such as small fishing activities, farming practices, pastoralism and petty businesses.

==Stage Two==
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|World population 10,000 BC-2017 AD]]
This stage leads to a fall in death rates and an increase in population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml BBC bitesize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023172810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes leading to this stage in Europe were initiated in the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century and were initially quite slow.  In the 20th century, the falls in death rates in developing countries tended to be substantially faster.  Countries in this stage include [[Yemen]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Iraq]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (but do not include [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Kenya]], [[Gabon]] and [[Ghana]], which have begun to move into stage 3).&lt;ref name=Caldwell10&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the death rate is due initially to two factors:
*First, improvements in the food supply brought about by higher yields in agricultural practices and better transportation reduce death due to starvation and lack of water.  Agricultural improvements included [[crop rotation]], [[selective breeding]], and [[seed drill]] technology.
*Second, significant improvements in public health reduce mortality, particularly in childhood. These are not so many medical breakthroughs (Europe passed through stage two before the advances of the mid-20th century, although there was significant medical progress in the 19th century, such as the development of [[vaccination]]) as they are improvements in water supply, [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]], food handling, and general personal [[hygiene]] following from growing scientific knowledge of the causes of disease and the improved education and social status of mothers.

A consequence of the decline in mortality in Stage Two is an increasingly rapid growth in population growth (a.k.a. "[[population explosion]]") as the gap between deaths and births grows wider and wider. Note that this growth is not due to an increase in fertility (or birth rates) but to a decline in deaths. This change in population occurred in north-western Europe during the 19th century due to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During the second half of the 20th century less-developed countries entered Stage Two, creating the worldwide rapid growth of number of living persons that has demographers concerned today. In this stage of DT, countries are vulnerable to become [[Failed States Index|failed states]] in the absence of progressive governments.

[[File:Angola population pyramid 2005.svg|right|upright=1.7|thumb| [[Population pyramid]] of [[Angola]] 2005]]
Another characteristic of Stage Two of the demographic transition is a change in the [[population pyramid|age structure]] of the population. In Stage One, the majority of deaths are concentrated in the first 5&amp;ndash;10 years of life. Therefore, more than anything else, the decline in death rates in Stage Two entails the increasing survival of children and a growing population. Hence, the age structure of the population becomes increasingly youthful and start to have big families and more of these children enter the reproductive cycle of their lives while maintaining the high fertility rates of their parents. The bottom of the "[[population pyramid|age pyramid]]" widens first where children, teenagers and infants are here, accelerating population growth rate. The age structure of such a population is illustrated by using an example from the [[Third World]] today.

==Stage Three==
In Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), death rates are low and birth rates diminish, as a rule accordingly of enhanced economic conditions, an expansion in women’s status and education, and access to contraception. The decrease in birth rate fluctuates from nation to nation, as does the time span in which it is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-3-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=16 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage Three moves the population towards stability through a decline in the birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UWC | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | series = Marathon | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]]s contribute to this eventual decline, and are generally similar to [[Sub-replacement fertility#Causes|those associated with sub-replacement fertility]], although some are speculative:
*In rural areas continued decline in childhood death means that at some point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and care for them in old age.
*Increasing [[urbanization]] changes the traditional values placed upon fertility and the value of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family. A recent theory suggests that urbanization also contributes to reducing the birth rate because it disrupts optimal mating patterns. A 2008 study in Iceland found that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins. Genetic incompatibilities inherent in more distant outbreeding makes reproduction harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Kissing cousins, missing children | url = http://www.economist.com/node/10640683?story_id=10640683 | journal= The Economist | date = 7 February 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In both rural and urban areas, the cost of children to parents is exacerbated by the introduction of compulsory education acts and the increased need to educate children so they can take up a respected position in society.  Children are increasingly prohibited under law from working outside the household and make an increasingly limited contribution to the household, as school children are increasingly exempted from the expectation of making a significant contribution to domestic work.  Even in equatorial Africa, children (age under 5) now required to have clothes and shoes, through the body, and may even require school uniforms. Parents begin to consider it a duty to buy children(s) books and toys,  partly due to education and access to family planning, people begin to reassess their need for children and their ability to grow them.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5/&gt;
[[File:Familyplanningmalaysia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A major factor in reducing birth rates in stage&amp;nbsp;3 countries such as Malaysia is the availability of family planning facilities, like this one in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia.]]
*Increasing literacy and employment lowers the uncritical acceptance of childbearing and motherhood as measures of the status of women. Working women have less time to raise children; this is particularly an issue where fathers traditionally make little or no contribution to child-raising, such as [[southern Europe]] or [[Japan]].  Valuation of women beyond childbearing and motherhood becomes important.
*Improvements in contraceptive technology are now a major factor. Fertility decline is caused as much by changes in values about children and gender as by the availability of contraceptives and knowledge of how to use them.

The resulting changes in the age structure of the population include a decline in the youth [[dependency ratio]] and eventually [[population aging]]. The population structure becomes less triangular and more like an elongated balloon. During the period between the decline in youth dependency and rise in old age dependency there is a [[demographic window]] of opportunity that can potentially produce economic growth through an increase in the ratio of working age to dependent population; the [[demographic dividend]].

However, unless factors such as those listed above are allowed to work, a society's birth rates may not drop to a low level in due time, which means that the society cannot proceed to stage Three and is locked in what is called a [[demographic trap]].

Countries that have witnessed a fertility decline of over 50% from their pre-transition levels include: [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Panama]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Lebanon]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and many [[Pacific islands]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of 25–50% include: [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Demographics of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], [[Demographics of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Demographics of Zimbabwe| Zimbabwe]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of less than 25% include: [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]], [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].

==Stage Four==
This occurs where birth and death rates are both low, leading to a total population stable. Death rates are low for a number of reasons, primarily lower rates of diseases and higher production of food. The birth rate is low because people have more opportunities to choose if they want children; this is made possible by improvements in contraception or women gaining more independence and work opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.main-vision.com/richard/demographic.htm | title = Main vision | first =  | contribution = Demographic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The DTM is only a suggestion about the future population levels of a country, not a prediction.

Countries that are at this stage (2 &lt; [[Total Fertility Rate]] &lt; 2.5 in 2015) include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Grenada, Guam, India, Indonesia, Kosovo, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Palau, Peru, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tunisia, Turkey and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage Five==
{{See also|Population aging|Aging of Europe|Aging of Japan|Evolutionary psychology}}[[File:World population (UN).svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|United Nation's population projections by location.&lt;br&gt;
Note the vertical axis is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and represents millions of people.]]
The original Demographic Transition model has just four stages, but additional stages have been proposed. Both more-fertile and less-fertile futures have been claimed as a Stage Five.

Some countries have [[sub-replacement fertility]] (that is, below 2.1–2.2 children per woman). Replacement fertility is generally slightly higher than 2 (the level which replaces the two parents) both because boys are born more often than girls (about 1.05–1.1 to 1) and to compensate for deaths prior to full reproduction. Many European and East Asian countries now have higher death rates than birth rates. [[Population aging]] and [[population decline]] may eventually occur, assuming that the fertility rate does not change and sustained mass immigration does not occur.

In an article in the August 2009 issue of ''Nature'', Myrskylä, Kohler and [[Francesco Billari]] argue that the previously negative relationship between "development", as measured by the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), and birth rates has become J-shaped. The HDI is a composite of life expectancy, income, and level of education. Development promotes fertility decline at HDI levels below 0.9 but further advances in HDI cause a small rebound in birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08230.html | last1 = Myrskyla | first1 = M | last2 = Kohler | first2 = H-P | last3 = Billari | first3 = F | title= Advances in development reverse fertility declines | journal= Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7256 | pages = 741–43 | date = 6 August 2009| bibcode = 2009Natur.460..741M | doi = 10.1038/nature08230 | pmid=19661915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries with very high levels of development, fertility rates are now approaching two children per woman — although there are exceptions, notably Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The best of all possible worlds? | work = The Economist | date = 6 August 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current century, most developed countries have increased fertility. From the point of view of [[evolutionary biology]], wealthier people having fewer children is unexpected, as [[natural selection]] would be expected to favor individuals who are willing and able to convert plentiful resources into plentiful fertile descendants. This may be the result of a departure from the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Alice L. | last2 = Low | first2 = Bobbi S. | year = 2001 | title = Testing evolutionary hypotheses with demographic data | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 633–660 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Daly |first1=Martin |last2=Wilson |first2=Margo I |title=Human evolutionary psychology and animal behaviour |url=http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Daly%26Wilson-HEP-AB1999.pdf |publisher=Department of Psychology, McMaster University |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=26 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the perspective of [[evolutionary psychology]], the modern environment is exerting [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;

[[Jane Falkingham]] of [[Southampton University]] has noted that "We've actually got population projections wrong consistently over the last 50 years... we've underestimated the improvements in mortality... but also we've not been very good at spotting the trends in fertility."&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt; In 2004 a United Nations office published its guesses for global population in the year 2300; estimates ranged from a "low estimate" of 2.3 billion (tending to −0.32% per year) to a "high estimate" of 36.4 billion (tending to +0.54% per year), which were contrasted with a deliberately "unrealistic" illustrative "constant fertility" scenario of 134 trillion (obtained if 1995–2000 fertility rates stay constant into the far future).&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Population to 2300|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|accessdate=24 May 2016|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In stage 5 of the demographic transition, a country encounters misfortune as a whole this is because the death rate becomes higher than the birth rate. There will be a negative population growth rate which will affect the country. This will take a generation or two before the population grows back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-5-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=18 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on age structure==
[[File:Dtm pyramids.png|thumb|upright=1.4|One such visualization of this effect may be approximated by these hypothetical population pyramids.  ]]
The decline in death rate and birth rate that occurs during the demographic transition may transform the age structure. When the death rate declines during the second stage of the transition, the result is primarily an increase in the child population. The reason being that when the death rate is high (stage one), the infant mortality rate is very high, often above 200 deaths per 1000 children born. When the death rate falls or improves, this may include lower infant mortality rate and increased child survival. Over time, as individuals with increased survival rates age, there may also be an increase in the number of older children, teenagers, and young adults. This implies that there is an increase in the fertile population proportion which, with constant fertility rates, may lead to an increase in the number of children born. This will further increase the growth of the child population. The second stage of the demographic transition, therefore, implies a rise in child dependency and creates a youth bulge in the population structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John R.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-305-09450-5|location=|pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a population continues to move through the demographic transition into the third stage, fertility declines and the youth bulge prior to the decline ages out of child dependency into the working ages. This stage of the transition is often referred to as the golden age, and is typically when populations see the greatest advancements in living standards and economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, further declines in both mortality and fertility will eventually result in an aging population, and a rise in the aged dependency ratio. An increase of the aged dependency ratio often indicates that a population has reached below replacement levels of fertility, and as result does not have enough people in the working ages to support the economy, and the growing dependent population. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical studies==

===Britain===
Between 1750 and 1975 England experienced the transition from high levels of both mortality and fertility, to low levels. A major factor was the sharp decline in the death rate due to infectious diseases, which has fallen from about 11 per 1,000 to less than 1 per 1,000.  By contrast, the death rate from other causes was 12 per 1,000 in 1850 and has not declined markedly. The agricultural revolution and the development of transport, initiated by the construction of canals, led to greater availability of food and coal, and enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]] to improve the standard of living. Scientific discoveries and medical breakthroughs did not, in general, contribute importantly to the early major decline in infectious disease mortality.

===Ireland===
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Irish demographic status converged to the European norm.  Mortality rose above the European Community average, and in 1991 Irish fertility fell to replacement level. The peculiarities of Ireland's past demography and its recent rapid changes challenge established theory. The recent changes have mirrored inward changes in Irish society, with respect to family planning, women in the work force, the sharply declining power of the Catholic Church, and the emigration factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = DA | last = Coleman | title= The Demographic Transition in Ireland in International Context | journal= Proceedings of the British Academy | year = 1992 | issue = 79 | pages = 53–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France displays real divergences from the standard model of Western demographic evolution.  The uniqueness of the French case arises from its specific demographic history, its historic cultural values, and its internal regional dynamics. France's demographic transition was unusual in that the mortality and the natality decreased at the same time, thus there was no demographic boom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quand l'Angleterre rattrapait la France |journal=Population &amp; Societes |date=May 1999 |issue=346 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demographic_transition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's demographic profile is similar to its European neighbors and to developed countries in general, yet it seems to be staving off the population decline of Western countries. With 62.9 million inhabitants in 2006, it was the second most populous country in the European Union, and it displayed a certain demographic dynamism, with a growth rate of 2.4% between 2000 and 2005, above the European average. More than two-thirds of that growth can be ascribed to a natural increase resulting from high fertility and birthrates. In contrast, France is one of the developed nations whose migratory balance is rather weak, which is an original feature at the European level. Several interrelated reasons account for such singularities, in particular the impact of pro-family policies accompanied by greater unmarried households and out-of-wedlock births. These general demographic trends parallel equally important changes in regional demographics. Since 1982 the same significant tendencies have occurred throughout mainland France: demographic stagnation in the least-populated rural regions and industrial regions in the northeast, with strong growth in the southwest and along the Atlantic coast, plus dynamism in metropolitan areas. Shifts in population between regions account for most of the differences in growth. The varying demographic evolution regions can be analyzed though the filter of several parameters, including residential facilities, economic growth, and urban dynamism, which yield several distinct regional profiles. The distribution of the French population therefore seems increasingly defined not only by interregional mobility but also by the residential preferences of individual households. These challenges, linked to configurations of population and the dynamics of distribution, inevitably raise the issue of town and country planning. The most recent census figures show that an outpouring of the urban population means that fewer rural areas are continuing to register a negative migratory flow – two-thirds of rural communities have shown some since 2000. The spatial demographic expansion of large cities amplifies the process of peri-urbanization yet is also accompanied by movement of selective residential flow, social selection, and sociospatial segregation based on income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Guy | last1 = Baudelle | first2 = David | last2 = Olivier | title= Changement Global, Mondialisation et Modèle De Transition Démographique: réflexion sur une exception française parmi les pays développés | journal= Historiens et Géographes | year = 2006 | volume = 98 | issue = 395 | pages = 177–204 | issn = 0046-757X | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
McNicoll (2006) examines the common features behind the striking changes in health and fertility in East and Southeast Asia in the 1960s–1990’s, focusing on seven countries: Taiwan and South Korea ("tiger" economies), Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia ("second wave" countries), and China and Vietnam ("market-Leninist" economies). Demographic change can be seen as a byproduct of social and economic development together with, in some cases, strong governmental pressures. The transition sequence entailed the establishment of an effective, typically authoritarian, system of local administration, providing a framework for promotion and service delivery in health, education, and family planning.  Subsequent economic liberalization offered new opportunities for upward mobility — and risks of backsliding —, accompanied by the erosion of social capital and the breakdown or privatization of service programs.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Korea====
Cha (2007) analyzes a panel data set to explore how industrial revolution, demographic transition, and human capital accumulation interacted in Korea from 1916–38. Income growth and public investment in health caused mortality to fall, which suppressed fertility and promoted education. Industrialization, skill premium, and closing gender wage gap further induced parents to opt for child quality. Expanding demand for education was accommodated by an active public school building program. The interwar agricultural depression aggravated traditional income inequality, raising fertility and impeding the spread of mass schooling. Landlordism collapsed in the wake of de-colonization, and the consequent reduction in inequality accelerated human and physical capital accumulation, hence leading to growth in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Myung | first = Soo Cha | title = Industrial Revolution, Demographic Transition, and Human Capital Accumulation in Korea, 1916–38 | publisher = Naksungdae Institute of Economic Research | type = working Paper | date = July 2007 | url = http://www.naksung.re.kr/papers/wp2007-7.pdf | format = PDF | place = KR}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madagascar===
Campbell has studied the demography of 19th-century Madagascar in the light of demographic transition theory. Both supporters and critics of the theory hold to an intrinsic opposition between human and "natural" factors, such as climate, famine, and disease, influencing demography. They also suppose a sharp chronological divide between the precolonial and colonial eras, arguing that whereas "natural" demographic influences were of greater importance in the former period, human factors predominated thereafter. Campbell argues that in 19th-century Madagascar the human factor, in the form of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina state]], was the predominant demographic influence. However, the impact of the state was felt through natural forces, and it varied over time. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Merina state policies stimulated agricultural production, which helped to create a larger and healthier population and laid the foundation for Merina military and economic expansion within Madagascar. From 1820, the cost of such expansionism led the state to increase its exploitation of forced labor at the expense of agricultural production and thus transformed it into a negative demographic force.  Infertility and infant mortality, which were probably more significant influences on overall population levels than the adult mortality rate, increased from 1820 due to disease, malnutrition, and stress, all of which stemmed from state forced labor policies. Available estimates indicate little if any population growth for Madagascar between 1820 and 1895. The demographic "crisis" in Africa, ascribed by critics of the demographic transition theory to the colonial era, stemmed in Madagascar from the policies of the imperial Merina regime, which in this sense formed a link to the French regime of the colonial era. Campbell thus questions the underlying assumptions governing the debate about historical demography in Africa and suggests that the demographic impact of political forces be reevaluated in terms of their changing interaction with "natural" demographic influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Gwyn | last1 = Campbell | title= State and Pre-colonial Demographic History: the Case of Nineteenth-century Madagascar | journal= Journal of African History | year = 1991 | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–45 |  issn = 0021-8537 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700031534}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===

Russia entered stage two of the transition in the 18th century, simultaneously with the rest of Europe, though the effect of transition remained limited to a modest decline in death rates and steady population growth. The population of Russia nearly quadrupled during the 19th century, from 30 million to 133 million, and continued to grow until the First World War and the turmoil that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/russia.htm|title=Population of Eastern Europe|date=|website=tacitus.nu|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia then quickly transitioned through stage three. Though fertility rates rebounded initially and almost reached 7 children/woman in the mid-1920s, they were depressed by the 1931–33 famine, crashed due to the Second World War in 1941, and only rebounded to a sustained level of 3 children/woman after the war. By 1970 Russia was firmly in stage four, with crude birth rates and crude death rates on the order of 15/1000 and 9/1000 respectively.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Russia underwent a unique demographic transition; observers call it a "demographic catastrophe": the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, life expectancy fell sharply (especially for males) and the number of suicides increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = George J | editor-last = Demko | others = et al | title = Population under Duress: The Geodemography of Post-Soviet Russia | year = 1999 | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91465272 | publisher = Questia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1992 through 2011, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births.

=== United States ===
Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) show that from 1800 to 1940 there was a [[demographic shift]] from a mostly rural US population with high fertility, with an average of seven children born per white woman, to a minority (43%) rural population with low fertility, with an average of two births per white woman. This shift resulted from technological progress. A sixfold increase in real wages made children more expensive in terms of forgone opportunities to work and increases in agricultural productivity reduced rural demand for labor, a substantial portion of which traditionally had been performed by children in farm families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The U.S. Demographic Transition|last=Greenwood |first=Jeremy |last2=Seshadri |first2=Ananth|date=January 2002|ssrn = 297952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplification of the DTM theory proposes an initial decline in mortality followed by a later drop in fertility. The changing demographics of the U.S. in the last two centuries did not parallel this model. Beginning around 1800, there was a sharp fertility decline; at this time, an average woman usually produced seven births per lifetime, but by 1900 this number had dropped to nearly four. A mortality decline was not observed in the U.S. until almost 1900—a hundred years following the drop in fertility.

However, this late decline occurred from a very low initial level. During the 17th and 18th centuries, crude death rates in much of colonial North America ranged from 15 to 25 deaths per 1000 residents per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of the United States|author= Herbert S. Klein|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of North America|author1= Michael R. Haines |author2=Richard H. Steckel|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; (levels of up to 40 per 1000 being typical during stages one and two). Life expectancy at birth was on the order of 40 and, in some places, reached 50, and a resident of 18th century Philadelphia who reached age 20 could have expected, on average, additional 40 years of life.

This phenomenon is explained by the pattern of colonization of the United States. Sparsely populated interior of the country allowed ample room to accommodate all the "excess" people, counteracting mechanisms (spread of communicable diseases due to overcrowding, low real wages and insufficient calories per capita due to the limited amount of available agricultural land) which led to high mortality in the Old World. With low mortality but stage 1 birth rates, the United States necessarily experienced exponential population growth (from less than 4 million people in 1790, to 23 million in 1850, to 76 million in 1900.)

The only area where this pattern did not hold was the American South. High prevalence of deadly endemic diseases such as malaria kept mortality as high as 45–50 per 1000 residents per year in 18th century North Carolina. In [[New Orleans]], mortality remained so high (mainly due to [[yellow fever]]) that the city was characterized as the "death capital of the United States" – at the level of 50 per 1000 population or higher – well into the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael R. |last=Haines |title=The Urban Mortality Transition in the United States, 1800–1940 |journal=NBER Historical Working Paper No. 134 |date=July 2001 |doi=10.3386/h0134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the U.S. is recognized as having both low fertility and mortality rates. Specifically, birth rates stand at 14 per 1000 per year and death rates at 8 per 1000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#People | title = World factbook | contribution = US | publisher = CIA | place = USA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
[[File:Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Countries with lower economic development have much faster demographic transition than high-income countries.]]
It must be remembered that the DTM is only a model and cannot necessarily predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, as it has been shown that after a [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.9 the fertility increases again.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

DTM does not account for recent phenomena such as [[AIDS]]; in these areas HIV has become the leading source of mortality.  Some trends in waterborne bacterial infant mortality are also disturbing in countries like [[Malawi]], [[Sudan]] and [[Nigeria]]; for example, progress in the DTM clearly arrested and reversed between 1975 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.populationaction.org/resources/researchCommentaries/Nov06_AgeStructure.htm | contribution = Nigeria: Reversal of Demographic Transition | title = Population action | date = November 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTM assumes that population changes are induced by industrial changes and increased wealth, without taking into account the role of social change in determining birth rates, e.g., the education of women. In recent decades more work has been done on developing the social mechanisms behind it.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;

DTM assumes that the birth rate is independent of the death rate. Nevertheless, demographers maintain that there is no historical evidence for society-wide fertility rates rising significantly after high mortality events. Notably, some historic populations have taken many years to replace lives after events such as the [[Black Death]].

Some have claimed that DTM does not explain the early fertility declines in much of Asia in the second half of the 20th century or the delays in fertility decline in parts of the Middle East.  Nevertheless, the demographer [[John Caldwell (demographer)|John C Caldwell]] has suggested that the reason for the rapid decline in fertility in some [[developing country|developing countries]] compared to Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is mainly due to government programs and a massive investment in education both by governments and parents.&lt;ref name=Caldwell10/&gt;

==Second demographic transition==
The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is a conceptual framework first formulated in 1986 by Ron Lesthaeghe and Dirk van de Kaa in a short article that was published in the Dutch sociology journal ''Mens en Maatschappij''.&lt;ref name="Lesthaeghe_2011"&gt;{{citation |author=Ron J.

Combined with the [[sexual revolution]] and the increased role of women in society and the workforce the resulting changes have profoundly affected the demographics of industrialized countries resulting in a [[sub-replacement fertility]] level.&lt;ref name="Kaa012902"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dirk J. van de Kaa|title=The Idea of a Second Demographic Transition in Industrialized Countries|date=29 January 2002|url=http://websv.ipss.go.jp/webj-ad/WebJournal.files/population/2003_4/Kaa.pdf|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes, increased numbers of women choosing to not marry or have children, increased cohabitation outside marriage, increased childbearing by single mothers, increased participation by women in higher education and professional careers, and other changes are associated with increased individualism and autonomy, particularly of women. Motivations have changed from traditional and economic ones to those of self-realization.&lt;ref name="PNAC122314"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ron Lesthaeghe|title=The second demographic transition: A concise overview of its development|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=December 23, 2014 |volume=111|issue=51|pages=18112–18115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1420441111|pmid=25453112|pmc=4280616|bibcode=2014PNAS..11118112L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Nicholas Eberstadt, political economist at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, described the Second Demographic Transition as one in which "long, stable marriages are out, and divorce or separation are in, along with serial cohabitation and increasingly contingent liaisons."&lt;ref name="WSJ_Eberstadt_2015"&gt;{{citation |quote=‘They’re getting divorced, and they’ll do anything NOT to get custody of the kids.” So reads the promotional poster, in French, for a new movie, “Papa ou Maman"|title=The Global Flight From the Family: It's not only in the West or prosperous nations—the decline in marriage and drop in birth rates is rampant, with potentially dire fallout |author=Nicholas Eberstadt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nicholas-eberstadt-the-global-flight-from-the-family-1424476179|date=February 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |publisher=''Wall Street Journal'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diodorus Siculus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|d|ɔː|r|ə|s|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Διόδωρος Σικελιώτης}} ''Diodoros Sikeliotes'') ({{fl.}}&amp;nbsp;1st century BC) or '''Diodorus of Sicily''' was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]. He is known for writing the monumental [[universal history]] ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of [[Troy]], arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Greece and Europe. The second covers the [[Trojan War]] to the death of [[Alexander the Great]]. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. ''Bibliotheca'', meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.

==Life==
According to his own work, he was born at [[Agira|Agyrium]] in [[Sicily]] (now called Agira).&lt;ref&gt;Diod. ''History'' 1.4.4.&lt;/ref&gt; With one exception, [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] affords no further information about his life and doings beyond in his work. Only [[Jerome]], in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' under the "year of [[Abraham]] 1968" (49 BC), writes, "Diodorus of Sicily, a writer of Greek history, became illustrious". However, his [[English language|English]] translator, [[Charles Henry Oldfather]], remarks on the "striking coincidence"&lt;ref&gt;''Diodorus of Sicily In Twelve Volumes'' by [[Charles Henry Oldfather]] (1977), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; that one of only two known Greek inscriptions from Agyrium (''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' XIV, 588) is the tombstone of one "Diodorus, the son of Apollonius".&lt;ref&gt;''Ctesias' Persian History: Introduction, text, and translation by Ctesias'' by Jan P. Stronk (2010), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{main|Bibliotheca historica}}
[[File:Bibliotheca historica.tif|thumb|''Bibliotheca historica'', 1746]]
Diodorus' [[universal history]], which he named ''Bibliotheca historica'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἱστορικὴ Βιβλιοθήκη}}, "Historical Library"), was immense and consisted of 40 books, of which 1–5 and 11–20 survive:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164108/Diodorus-Siculus "Diodorus Siculus" entry in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''].&lt;/ref&gt; fragments of the lost books are preserved in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] and the excerpts of [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]].

It was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of [[Ancient Egypt]] (book I), of [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], [[Scythia]], and [[Arabia]] (II), of [[North Africa]] (III), and of [[Greece]] and Europe (IV–VI).

In the next section (books VII&amp;ndash;XVII), he recounts the history of the world from the [[Trojan War]] down to the [[death of Alexander the Great]]. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the [[Diadochi|successors of Alexander]] down to either 60 BC or the beginning of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars]]. (The end has been lost, so it is unclear whether Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours he stopped short at 60 BC.) He selected the name "Bibliotheca" in acknowledgment that he was assembling a composite work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], [[Ephorus]], [[Theopompus]], [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], [[Duris of Samos]], [[Diyllus]], [[Philistus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Polybius]], and [[Posidonius]].

His account of [[gold mining]] in [[Nubia]] in eastern [[Egypt]] is one of the earliest extant texts on the topic, and describes in vivid detail the use of [[slave labour]] in terrible working conditions. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] wrote a Commentary on Diodorus's ''Analemma''. The now lost ''Analemma'' applied geometrical constructions in a plane to solve some astronomy-related problems of spherical geometry. It contained, for example, a discussion of sundial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones, Introduction, ''Pappus of Alexandria Book 7 of the Collection: Part 1. Introduction, Text, and Translation'' (2013) ed., Tr. &amp; commentary by Alexander Jones, ''Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 8''&lt;/ref&gt;

He also gave an account of the [[Gauls]]:
"The Gauls are terrifying in aspect and their voices are deep and altogether harsh; when they meet together they converse with few words and in riddles, hinting darkly at things for the most part and using one word when they mean another; and they like to talk in superlatives, to the end that they may extol themselves and depreciate all other men. They are also boasters and threateners and are fond of pompous language, and yet they have sharp wits and are not without cleverness at learning." (Book 5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Diodorus Siculus — Book V Chapters 19‑40|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eco-Schools''' is an international programme of the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE)  that aims to empower students to be the change our sustainable world needs by engaging them in fun, action-orientated and socially responsible learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoschools.global/ |title=Eco Schools |website=Ecoschools.global |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.global/ |title=Foundation for Environmental EducationFoundation for Environmental Education |website=Fee.global |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each school follows a seven step change process and empowers their young people to lead processes and actions wherever they can.

Over time and through commitment to the Eco-Schools Seven Step process, improvements will be seen in both the learning outcomes, attitude and behaviour of students and the local community, and ultimately the local environment. Evidence of success in these areas will eventually lead to a school being awarded with the International Green Flag.

Eco-Schools is one of the programmes recognised by the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005 – 2104), awarding certificates to thousands of schools around the world.&lt;ref name=decade&gt;[https://www.bibb.de/dokumente/pdf/a33_un_decade_final_report_2014_230171e.pdf ‘Shaping the Future We Want’ – UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) Final Report], p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Eco-Schools programme extends from kindergartens to universities and is implemented in 67 countries, involving 51,000 schools and institutions, and over 19,000,000 students.  It is the largest international network of teachers and students in the world.&lt;ref name=decade /&gt; FEE EcoCampus is the name of the programme at university level.    
[[File:The Green Flag.gif|thumb|The Eco-Schools Green Flag]]

== History ==

The programme was developed in 1992 in response to the need to involve young people in environmental projects at the local level as identified at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] of 1992.

Eco-Schools was launched in 1994 in Denmark, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom with the support of the European Commission. When the Foundation for Environmental Education became global in 2001, countries outside of Europe began joining the Eco-Schools programme, as well.  South Africa was the first country to do so.

In 2003 Eco-Schools was identified by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) as a model initiative for [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spirala.sk/wp-content/uploads/100201-memorandum-o-porozumeni-fee-unep.pdf FEE – UNEP Memorandum of Understanding] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
[[File:Eco-Schools in South Africa.jpg|thumb|Eco-Schools in South Africa]]
The International Eco-Schools Programme takes a holistic, participatory approach to learning for sustainability. The aim of the programme is to engage students through classroom study, school and community action to raise awareness of sustainable development issues.&lt;ref&gt;‘Greenrock expands Eco-School Programme’, Bermuda Sun, 20 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Clés De Demain, ‘L'Eco-Ecole fête ses 20 ans’, LeMonde.fr, 28 Aug. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages students and teachers to conduct research on the amount of waste, energy or water use at their school and work towards making it a more sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;Arandjelovic, Nadia “Eco-Schools programme helps students ‘change their place of learning’”, The Royal Gazette, 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Schools provide an integrated system for the environmental management of schools and involve all stakeholders in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, LG (2008) [http://www.developmenteducationreview.com/issue6-perspectives2 'The whole-school approach to education for sustainable development: From pilot projects to systemic change'], Policy &amp; Practice: A Development Education Review, Vol. 6, Spring, pp. 69-74&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The whole schools approach embedded in the Eco-Schools programme emphasises the importance of an ongoing focus on the issues linked to environmental, climate and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, V.V., Doyle, D., Klein, J., &amp; Didham, R.J. (2015) ''‘Responsible Living: Concepts, Education and Future Perspectives’'', Springer, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme’s methodology consists of Seven Steps&lt;ref&gt;Andreou, Nicole (2017). Schools Turning Communities Green in International School Magazine, p.39-40 https://cloud.3dissue.com/2389/3124/7031/is19-3/offline/download.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/seven-steps/ ''’Seven Steps Towards an Eco-School’'']&lt;/ref&gt; that the school needs to adopt.

'''Step 1'''  Establishment of the Eco-Schools Committee &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 2'''  Environmental review &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 3'''  Action Plan &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 4'''  Monitoring and Evaluation &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 5'''  Curriculum Linking &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 6'''  Informing and involving the wider community &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 7'''  Eco Code

Schools are encouraged to work on eleven Themes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/themes/ ''’Eco-Schools Themes’'']&lt;/ref&gt; which are as follows: Biodiversity &amp; Nature, Climate Change, Energy, Global Citizenship, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Litter, Marine and Coast, School Grounds, Transport, Waste, Water.

== Participation and awards ==

Any school may participate in the scheme by registering with the FEE member organisation in their country. Once registered, each school must review and improve their impact on the environment and in recognition of their commitment and progress they can then apply for an award.

Successful Eco-Schools are awarded the International Green Flag, an internationally acknowledged symbol for environmental excellence. In some countries, this recognition happens through a three level system, where schools are awarded either bronze and silver awards before receiving the  International Green Flag.

There is flexibility to the ceremony and awarding process but the criteria for assessing schools for the award must follow the guidelines of FEE's International Eco-Schools programme.

== Process ==

To qualify for an award the school must follow the following programme:

* Register – usually done by an adult (teacher or parent).
* Eco-Schools Committee – a group of pupils and adults – some elected by their peers are assembled to manage the process.
* Environmental Review – the Eco-Schools Committee must organise the school to carry out a review of the school's energy and water usage, waste production and state of the school grounds with respect to litter.
* Action Plan – formed from issues identified by the review
* Eco Code – the Eco-Schools Committee, with the participation of the whole school must develop a mission statement to be prominently advertised inside and outside the school.
* Link to Curriculum and Take Action – demonstrable progress must be made in three areas of the curriculum and involve as much of the school as possible.
* Monitor and Review – the Eco-Schools Committee must record and analyse the progress made

After these processes are complete the school can apply for one of the awards mentioned above dependent on the level of environmental progress made.

== FEE EcoCampus ==
[[File:EcoCampus UCC.jpg|thumb|University College Cork was awarded the Green Flag in 2010]] 
The FEE EcoCampus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/ecocampus/ FEE EcoCampus]&lt;/ref&gt; programme is an evolution of the Eco-Schools programme. It targets students in third level education in various countries and is implemented in the same way as Eco-Schools. The only real difference is that students devise an Eco Charter instead of an Eco Code. &lt;br&gt;
This Charter is a document which is a guide to environmental management on site.

EcoCampus began in Russia in 2003 and the first whole institution Green Flags were awarded in Ireland in 2010, to [[University College Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;Green-Campus Ireland [http://www.greencampusireland.org/news/19th-february-2010-ucc-raising-the-green-flag- ''‘19th February 2010: UCC Raising the Green Flag!’''] 30 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Forest Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaf.global/the-global-forest-fund/ Global Forest Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; ==

Eco-Schools compensates for their CO2 emissions from their flight travels when they go to, for example, conferences and National Operator Meetings through the Global Forest Fund. FEE has established the Global Forest Fund to help minimise the effects of CO2 emissions from the increased travel activity worldwide. The Fund supports schools and organisations by funding CO2 compensation efforts such as planting trees and environmental education activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">[[File:Amanita muscaria After Rain.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' has a long and varied history of psychoactive use.]]
'''Ethnomycology''' is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of [[fungi]] and can be considered a subfield of [[ethnobotany]] or [[ethnobiology]]. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as [[tinder]], medicine ([[medicinal mushrooms]]) and food (including [[yeast]]), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as [[psilocybin mushrooms]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, and the [[ergot]] fungus.

American banker [[Robert Gordon Wasson]] pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]'', held by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[Curandero|curandera]]'' [[María Sabina]]. The biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]] is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer.  Later researchers in the field include [[Terence McKenna]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Carl Ruck]], [[Blaise Daniel Staples]], [[Giorgio Samorini]], [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], [[John Marco Allegro]], [[Clark Heinrich]], [[Jonathan Ott]], and [[Paul Stamets]].

Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on [[anthropology]] and [[philology]]. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] of the [[Indo-Aryans]] was the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-15-683800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his example similar attempts have been made to identify psychoactive mushroom usage in many other (mostly) ancient cultures, with varying degrees of credibility. Another much written about topic is the content of the [[Kykeon]], the [[sacrament]] used during the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] in [[ancient Greece]] between approximately 1500 BCE and 396 CE.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Heinrich]] claims that ''Amanita muscaria'' use in Europe was not completely wiped out by [[Orthodox Christianity]] but continued to be used (either consumed or merely symbolically) by individuals and small groups such as [[medieval]] [[Holy Grail]] [[myth]] makers, [[alchemy|alchemists]] and [[Renaissance]] artists.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book

While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the [[shamanic]] or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] mushrooms as the original "[[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]".&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the [[rave]] culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the [[Internet]]. This "mushrooming of mushroom use" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in [[Christmas]] and [[fairy tale]] symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far-reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8145">'''Fritz Neugass''' (March 28, 1899, [[Mannheim]]–June 1979, [[New York City]]) was a German art critic and photographer.

==Early life==
Fritz Neugass was of Jewish origin. His father Julius Neugass (1869-1939) was an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat specialist]] in [[Mannheim]]. Neugass took part in [[World War I]] in 1917, but was released in 1918 after being seriously injured. Influenced by the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement, he temporarily turned to [[Protestantism]]. 

==Art historian==
From 1919 he studied art history and archeology in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]] and [[Bonn]] and completed his doctorate in 1924, writing a thesis on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]], supervised by art historian [[Carl Neumann Degler|Carl Neumann]] (1860-1934) in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000584035 Neugass, F. (1927). Mittelalterliches chorgestühl in Deutschland. Strassburg: J. H. E. Heitz.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he was a volunteer at the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutschen Archäologischen Institut]] (German Archaeological Institute) in [[Rome]] and then in [[Florence]] and participated in excavations on [[Sicily]]. 

==Photographer and journalist==
In 1926 he settled in Paris and became a photographer and correspondent for numerous German and international newspapers. He reported for the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', [[Cicerone (publisher)|Cicerone]], ''[[KUNST Magazin|Kunst]]'', and especially Weltkunst. He became known for his reviews for world art and reports on the current [[Paris]] art scene. In addition to exhibition reports and essayistic works he wrote knowledgeable monographs on artists including [[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In autumn 1933 he was romantically involved with {{ill|Luise Straus-Ernst|de}}, first wife of [[Max Ernst]] (m. 1918–1927), who had fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Weissweiler, Eva | title=Notre Dame de Dada : Luise Straus-Ernst, das dramatische Leben der ersten Frau von Max Ernst | publication-date=2016 | publisher=Köln Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch | edition=1. Auflage | isbn=978-3-462-04894-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933-39, he set out as a photographer and correspondent traveling widely and reported for English, American, French and Swiss newspapers mainly on travel and politics in Mediterranean countries.

Shortly after the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Neugass was interned in the camp [[Fort Carré]] in [[Antibes]]. In November 1939 he was transferred to [[Les Milles]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]]. There he met amongst others Max Ernst, [[Walter Hasenclever]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]. In 1939, under the pseudonym "François Neuville" he wrote the novel ''Das Geheimnis um die Venus'' (‘The Mystery about Venus’), originally planned as a movie starring the actor [[Raimu]], which appeared in two separate Swiss newspapers. In the spring of that year he joined the French army.

As a journalist, he was accused by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in 1941 of distributing enemy propaganda and sentenced. In order to forestall the impending expulsion to Germany, he emigrated in late 1941 via [[Casablanca]] and [[Cuba]] to the [[United States]]. 

==Life in the United States==
From 1942 to 1947 Neugass worked in various bookstores and for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. In 1944 he married librarian Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin, and was granted American citizenship in 1947 and freelanced for several magazines, including articles illustrated with his own photographs ’Window Shopping With Your Camera’ for ''[[Popular Photography]].''&lt;ref&gt;Popular Photography, Dec 1949, Vol. 25, No. 6. pps 40-43&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Portraiture with Match and Candle' for ''The American Annual of Photography''&lt;ref&gt;The American Annual of Photography, Volume 67, p.52ff Tennant and Ward, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he wrote for various European newspapers [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'']], ''[[Handelsblatt]]'', ''[[Aufbau]]'', and [[ARTnews|''Art News'']] and was the American correspondent to the Swiss [[Camera (magazine)|''Camera'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=49hTAAAAMAAJ Tom Maloney U.S. Camera Annual 1952, Page 58]&lt;/ref&gt; in which, in writing on 'The photographers of the United Nations' he expressed the opinion that “The aim of the United Nations is identical with that which lies closest to the hearts of photographers: to bring the nations closer together through mutual understanding,”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz NEUGASS, “The photographers of the United Nations.” Camera, 1954, issue 9, page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Neugass became a member of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was exhibited in the Village Camera Club. He traveled to [[Mexico]] to make [[Ethnology|ethnological]] photographic documentation of rural life&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.albany.edu/luna/servlet/view/search/what/Fritz+Neugass+Papers?q=neugass&amp;sort=archive_collection%2Cdate%2Ctitle%2Csubject&amp;os=0&amp;pgs=50 See University of Albany image search]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 which was shown in an exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1954. His photography was featured by [[Edward Steichen]] in two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; ''Abstraction in Photography'', May 1–July 4, 1951 which featured his photographs of New York skyscrapers reflected in puddles, windows and on car duco, and [[The Family of Man|''The Family of Man'']] January 24–May 8, 1955, his contribution to the latter being made on [[Coney Island]] of swimsuit-clad couples embracing on the beach. The photograph later illustrated a 1979 book on body language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Givens, David B | author2=Center for Nonverbal Studies | title=The nonverbal dictionary of gestures, signs &amp; body language cues : from Adam's-apple-jump to zygomatic smile | publication-date=1998 | publisher=Center for Nonverbal Studies Press | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22295917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
Neugass' late work as a journalist included critical evaluations of the buying policy of the museums and strategies of the art market. Due to failing health, in January 1979, Neugass turned down their offer to be American editor for the German magazine ''Kunst''. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at [[Goethe-Institut, New York|Goethe House]] in New York City.

His estate is kept in the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], New York and was compiled by Lotte Neugass (née Labus) prior to their deposit there in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://meg.library.albany.edu:8443/archive/view?docId=ger007.xml Fritz Neugass Papers 1913-1979, M.E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">'''Genre criticism''', a method within [[rhetorical criticism]], analyzes texts in terms of their genre: the set of generic expectations, conventions, and constraints that guide their production and interpretation. In [[rhetoric]], the theory of [[genre]] provides a means to classify and compare artifacts in terms of their formal, substantive and contextual features. By grouping artifacts with others which have similar formal features or rhetorical exigencies, rhetorical critics can shed light on how authors use or flout conventions for their own purposes. Genre criticism has thus become one of the main methodologies within rhetorical criticism. 

Literary critics have used the concepts of genres to classify speeches and works of literature since the time of [[Aristotle]], who distinguished three rhetorical genres: the [[Forensic rhetoric | legal or judicial]], the [[Deliberative rhetoric | deliberative]] or political, and the ceremonial or [[epideictic]].  Since then, rhetorical approaches to genre and understanding of the term "genre" have evolved in several ways. New genres have been studied for their rhetorical effectiveness - like sermons, letters, and (more recently) non-verbal genres like political cartoons, film, and public monuments.  Further contemporary genre criticism has revised understanding of genre in several ways. The first [[turn (disambiguation) | turn]], represented by [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]] (1895-1975), among others, focused on the formal features of communication. The second turn, represented by Carolyn Miller, among others, focused on recurring socio-cultural circumstances. In the latest turn, critics have begun applying formalist and socio-cultural concepts to [[new media | new-media]] artifacts that tend to resist classification into traditional genre-categories.

== Emphasis on formal features in speech genres==
The first group of rhetorical critics, following the example of theorists like [[M. M. Bakhtin]], used formal features to analyze texts. For these critics, language is formed through a series of utterances that reflect specific conditions and goals of certain linguistic aspects. These aspects include thematic content, style, and compositional structure which form speech genres. Speech genres are diverse because of the various possibilities of human activity. In "The Problem of Speech Genres" (1986), Mikhail Bakhtin draws attention to the very significant difference between primary (simple) and secondary (complex) speech genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. M. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LO_agE_GTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Problem of Speech Genres"]. ''Speech genres and other late essays''. Trans. V. W. McGee. University of Texas Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bahktin, primary speech genres form secondary speech genres and examples of secondary speech genres include novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, and major genres of commentary. Since these secondary genres involve complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication that is artistic and scientific, they absorb and digest various primary genres that have taken form in mediated speech communion. Bakhtin continues to explain that there are three factors of the whole utterance which include semantic exhaustiveness of the theme, the speaker’s plan or speech will, and the typical compositional and generic forms of finalization.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; The first factor refers to the way utterances are used within speech which is linked to the second factor of how the speaker determines to use the utterance.The third factor explains that all our utterances have definite and stable typical forms of construction, but that these forms can change when needed. As Bahktin writes, "These genres are so diverse because they differ depending on the situation, social position, and personal interrelations of the participants in the communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical approaches to genre==
The word “[[genre]]” is derived from the [[Latin]] term ''genus'', to mean “kind”, “class” or "sort".

[[Aristotle]] was one of the first scholars to develop a rhetorical approach to genre. He divided the art of rhetoric into three genres: [[deliberative]], [[forensic]], and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, F.I (1995). "The Rhetoric of Aristotle". ''A Synoptic History of Classical Rhetoric'' (2nd rev. ed.), Davis, CA. Hermagoras Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberative genre of rhetoric involves speeches or writing meant to persuade an audience to take action. Deliberative rhetoric thus includes rhetoric that is used for political persuasion, discusses matters of public policy in order to determine what is advantageous or disadvantageous, and is usually concerned with the future. Rhetoric of the [[forensic]] genre questions guilt or innocence, is concerned with legalities, and concentrates on events that occurred in the past. The [[epideictic]] genre of rhetoric encompasses all rhetoric used for ceremonial and commemorative purposes. Epideictic rhetoric praises and blames, acknowledging that which is noble or shameful, honorable or dishonorable. 

The [[rhetorical situation]] is a concept important for understanding rhetorical approaches to genre and the creation of new genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L.F. (1968). "The rhetorical situation". ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', vol. 1, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign speeches are an example of how rhetorical situations recur, producing sedimented genres. As a result of the institutions that execute the [[U.S. Constitution]], every four years at the time of presidential elections, candidates deliver campaign speeches. Campaign speeches have become a distinct genre because they respond to highly similar situations that recur because of a structural or institutional basis.

U.S. rhetoricians [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] and [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] refer to genre as a “constellation of elements."&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"&gt;Karlyn Kohrs Campbell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (1978), ''Form and Genre: Shaping Rhetorical Action''. The Speech Communication Association. Falls Church, VA. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They say, “A genre is a group of acts unified by a constellation of forms that recurs in each of its members.” Genres are formed when examined constituents are similar. The metaphors of genres as “constellations” serves to explain how genres, like constellations of stars, are constructed of individual members, but are under the influence of each other and outside elements. As a result they move together and remain in a similar relation to each other despite their ever-changing positions.&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt; According to Campbell and Jamieson, “when a generic claim is made, the critical situation alters significantly because the critic is now arguing that a group of discourses has a synthetic core in which certain significant rhetorical elements, e.g., a system of belief, lines of argument, stylistic choices, and the perception of the situation, are fused into an indivisible whole".&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt;

Many contemporary scholars refer to the fusion of traits from different genres in speeches and texts as a "generic [[Hybrid genre|hybrid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, K.M.; Campbell, K.K. (1982). "Rhetorical hybrids: "'Fusion of generic elements'". ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (68), pp. 146-157.&lt;/ref&gt; These generic hybrids can be formed from a blend of the three rhetorical genres.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', (Trans. W.R. Roberts, 1954), New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be explained through an example of a generic hybrid of deliberative and epideictic elements, in which a newly elected President delivers an inaugural address. The President is speaking at a formal ceremony recognizing the current state of the nation (characteristic of the epideictic genre), while simultaneously announcing his policy plans for the upcoming four years. 

U.S. rhetorician Carolyn R. Miller is the author of the article "Genre as Social Action" (1984). She argues, “Rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish.” &lt;ref name="Miller 1984"&gt; Miller, C. R. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (70), pp. 151-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional, written genres. She is among other rhetoricians who have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. They argue that because genre theory originally was developed for describing written texts, the theory should be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Miller and colleague Dawn Shepherd illustrate an example of applying socio-cultural theories to genre studies in "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog". They explain how the weblog may be establishing a new genre because of its integration of current social and cultural trends.&lt;ref name ="blogging"&gt;Miller, C. R.; Shepherd, D.(2004). [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/blogging_as_social_action.html "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog"], Into the Blogosphere. Retrieved 10 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-cultural approach to genre studies==
In the 1980s, scholarship in genre theory and criticism has turned towards a socio-cultural approach to the study of genre by actively interrogating the rhetorical situation of a given communication artifact in light of its particular generic form. In this mode of inquiry, the rhetorical artifact is examined as a social response to a set of recurrent rhetorical exigencies rather than a collection of formal, generic elements. In the rhetorical tradition of genre criticism, Carolyn R. Miller's work on the socio-cultural approach to genre theory has been influential. Again in her 1984 journal article, Miller argues that “rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and that a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish”.&lt;ref name="Miller 1984"/&gt; Later, when Miller and Shepherd engaged the socio-cultural approach to genre criticism in “Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog” (2004), they exposed some of the difficulties of applying genre theory to new media. In their analysis, Miller and Shepherd examine the extent to which the weblog might constitute a genre in light of its interaction with current social and cultural trends.

==Genres studies in new media==
Recently scholars and researchers in [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], and [[information sciences]] have begun to explore the relationships between new media and socio-contextual genre theories (like those of Carolyn Miller, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Charles Bazerman). These researchers have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. Some scholars have argued that since genre theory was originally developed to describe written texts, the theory needs to be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Linguist and semiotician Gunter Kress suggested that much of the vocabulary of generic analysis is ill-equipped to address non-written communication, arguing that “there are no genre terms for describing what [a] drawing is or does…” &lt;ref&gt;Kress, G. &amp; Van Leeuwen, T (1996). ''Multimodal Discourse''. London: Routledge. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, rhetoricians Miller and Shepherd have argued that traditional written genre theory does not appropriately address the visual features of a genre’s format.&lt;ref name="blogging"/&gt;

Rhetoricians and [[Information science|information scientists]] have also pointed out that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional written genres. The authors of the article "Genres and the web" argue that the personal home page is functioning as a new and discrete genre, and they explore the entirely digital nature of home pages, suggesting that home pages “have no obvious paper equivalent”.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Andrew; Gushrowski, Barbara A. (2000). "Genres and the web: Is the personal home page the first uniquely digital genre?" ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science]]'', 51(2), pp. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent work in new media genre theory has explored how new communication technologies allows for forms of “genre [[hybridity]].” Spinuzzi, for example, explores what can happen when multiple related genres are [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediated]] into a single new media artifact.&lt;ref name="Clay Spinuzzi 2003"&gt;Spinuzzi, C. (2003). ''Tracing genres through organizations: A sociocultural approach to information design''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg Friedrich Strass''' ({{lang-fr|Georges Frédéric Strass}}; 29 May 1701, [[Wolfisheim]] near [[Strasbourg]] - 22 December 1773) was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[jeweler]] and inventor of imitation [[gemstones]]. He is best known as the inventor of the [[rhinestone]], called ''strass'' in many European languages, from a particular type of [[crystal]] he found in the river [[Rhine]].

He used mixtures of [[bismuth]] and [[thallium]] to improve the refractive quality of his imitations, and altered their colors with [[metal]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s. The imitations were, in his view, so similar to real gems that he invented the concept of the "simulated gemstone" to describe them. He considerably improved his gems' brilliance by gluing metal foil behind them. This foil was later replaced with a vapor-deposited mirror coating.

Strass opened his own business in 1730, and devoted himself wholly to the development of [[diamond simulant|imitation diamonds]]. Due to his great achievements, he was awarded the title "King's Jeweler" in 1734.

He was a partner in the jewellery business of Madame Prévot. He continued improving his artificial gemstones during this time. His work was in great demand at the court of King [[Louis XV of France]], and he controlled a large market for artificial gems.

Wealthy through his businesses, he was able to retire comfortably at age 52.

[[File:La Ritirata.jpg|thumb|280px|Performance on [[#Early instruments|period instrument]]s is a key aspect of HIP, such as this [[baroque orchestra]] (Photo: [[Josetxu Obregón]] and the Spanish ensemble La Ritirata)]]
'''Historically informed performance''' (also referred to as '''period performance''', '''authentic performance''', or '''HIP''') is an approach to the performance of [[Western classical music|classical music]], which aims to be faithful to the approach, manner and style of the [[musical era]] in which a work was originally conceived.

It is based on two key aspects: the application of the stylistic and technical aspects of performance, known as '''performance practice'''; and the use of '''[[#Early instruments|period instrument]]s''' which may be reproductions of historical instruments that were in use at the time of the original composition and which usually have different [[timbre]] and [[temperament (music)|temperament]].{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

Because no [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]]s exist of music before the modern era, historically informed performance is necessarily derived from academic [[Musicology|musicological research]]. Historical [[treatise]]s, as well as additional historical evidence, are used to gain insight into the performance practice of a historic era. HIP performers will normally base their interpretations on scholarly or [[urtext edition]]s of a musical score, unencumbered with suggestions or changes made by editors in later eras.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

Historically informed performance can trace its roots to the late 19th century, but was principally developed in a number of Western countries in the late 20th century. Initially mainly concerned with the performance of [[Medieval music|Medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque music]], it has since come to encompass music from the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras as well. The practice has been a crucial part of the [[Early music revival]] movement of the 20th and 21st centuries. Quite recently, the phenomenon has begun to affect the theatrical stage, for instance in the production of [[Baroque opera]], where historically informed approaches to acting and scenery are also used.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Mary|editor1-last=Greenwald|editor1-first=Helen M.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Opera|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199714841|pages=606–8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LOFvBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA608&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20opera%20theatre&amp;pg=PA608#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=en|chapter=27. Historically informed performance}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

There are some critics who contest the methodology of the HIP movement, contending that its selection of practices and aesthetics are a product of the 20th century and that it is ultimately impossible to know what performances of an earlier time sounded like. For this reason, the term "historically informed" is now preferred to "authentic", as it acknowledges the limitations of academic understanding, rather than implying absolute accuracy in recreating historical performance style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabian|first1=Dorottya|title=The Meaning of Authenticity and The Early Music Movement: A Historical Review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284522166_The_Meaning_of_Authenticity_and_The_Early_Music_Movement_A_Historical_Review|accessdate=3 March 2018|date=1 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt;

[[File:Edinburgh St Cecilia's Hall.jpg|thumb|Historical collections of preserved instruments help researchers ([[St Cecilia's Hall]], [[Edinburgh]])]]
The choice of musical instruments is an important part of the principle of historically informed performance. Musical instruments have evolved over time, and instruments that were in use in earlier periods of history were often quite different to their modern equivalents. Many other instruments have fallen out of use, having been replaced by newer tools for creating music. For example, prior to the emergence of the modern [[violin]], other bowed stringed instruments such as the [[rebec]] or the [[viol]] were in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silvela|first1=Zdenko|title=A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery|date=2001|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581126679|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXqBVbWm6tkC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=violin%20evolved%20from%20rebec&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of ancient instruments in museum collections has helped musicologists to understand how the different design, tuning and tone of instruments may have affected earlier performance practice.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=18-19}}

As well as a research tool, historic instruments have an active role in the practice of historically informed performance. Modern instrumentalists who aim to recreate a historic sound often use modern reproductions of period instruments (and occasionally original instruments) on the basis that this will deliver a musical performance that is thought to be historically faithful to the original work, as the original composer would have heard it. For example, a modern music ensemble staging a performance of music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] may play reproduction [[Baroque violin]]s instead of modern instruments in an attempt to create the sound of a 17th-century [[Baroque orchestra]].{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=18-19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schippers|first1=Huib|title=Facing the Music: Shaping Music Education from a Global Perspective|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199701933|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yYzW0ujEsIC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=period%20instruments%20authentic%20performance&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to the revival of musical instruments that had entirely fallen out of use, and to a reconsideration of the role and structure of instruments also used in current practice.{{Original research inline|date=March 2018}}

Orchestras and ensembles who are noted for their use of period instruments in performances include the [[Taverner Consort and Players]] (directed by [[Andrew Parrott]]), the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] ([[Christopher Hogwood]]), [[The English Concert]] ([[Trevor Pinnock]]), the [[English Baroque Soloists]] (Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]]), [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] ([[Reinhard Goebel]]), the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]] ([[Paul Dyer]]) and [[La Chapelle Royale]] ([[Philippe Herreweghe]]).&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Nick|title=The Art of Re-enchantment: Making Early Music in the Modern Age|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199939930|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fWgBAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=The%20Taverner%20Choir%2C%20Consort%20%26%20Players&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard-gardiner"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Waleson|first1=Heidi|title=Super-conductor: John Eliot Gardiner|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vgcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=English%20Baroque%20Soloists%20period%20instruments&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=7 September 1996|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knights|first1=F.|title=A farewell to Musica Antiqua Koln|journal=Early Music|date=1 February 2013|volume=41|issue=1|pages=173–174|doi=10.1093/em/cas166|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/41/1/173/353400|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|issn=0306-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippe Herreweghe|url=https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/philippe-herreweghe|website=www.concertgebouworkest.nl|publisher=Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the scope of historically informed performance has expanded to encompass the works of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], the specific sound of 19th-century instruments has increasingly been recognised in the HIP movement, and period instruments orchestras such as Gardiner's [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] have emerged.&lt;ref name="npr-gardiner"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Eliot Gardiner's Historical Beethoven At Carnegie Hall|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142340577/john-eliot-gardiners-historical-beethoven|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306121647/https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142340577/john-eliot-gardiners-historical-beethoven|archivedate=6 March 2018|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cembalo-Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg-2000.532+2.tif|thumb|Harpsichord by [[Pascal Taskin]], [[Paris]] (1780)  ([[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]])]]
A variety of once obsolete keyboard instruments such as the [[clavichord]] and the [[harpsichord]] have been revived as they have particular importance in the performance of Early music. Before the evolution of the symphony orchestra led by a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], Renaissance and Baroque orchestras were commonly directed from the harpsichord; the director would lead by playing [[Basso continuo|continuo]], which would provide a steady, harmonic structure upon which the other instrumentalists would embellish their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harpsichord - Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/harpsichord/|website=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306230901/http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/harpsichord/|archivedate=6 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kottick|first1=Edward L.|title=A History of the Harpsichord|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253341663|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uexrDtt7JKEC&amp;lpg=PA469&amp;dq=harpsichord%20baroque%20orchestra&amp;pg=PA469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious works of the era made similar use of the [[pipe organ]], often in combination with a harpsichord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moses|first1=Don V.|last2=Jr|first2=Robert W.

Composers such as [[François Couperin]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote for the harpsichord, clavichord, and organ.

Among the foremost modern players of the harpsichord are [[Robert Hill (musician)|Robert Hill]], [[Igor Kipnis]], [[Ton Koopman]], [[Wanda Landowska]], [[Gustav Leonhardt]], [[Trevor Pinnock]], [[Skip Sempé]], [[Andreas Staier]], and [[Colin Tilney]].

===Fortepiano===
During the second half of the 18th century, the harpsichord was gradually replaced by the [[fortepiano]], a precursor to the modern piano. As the harpsichord went out of fashion, many were destroyed; indeed, the Paris Conservatory is notorious for having used harpsichords for firewood during the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleonic times.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boekelheide, "[http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/10982.html Making Way for Beautiful Music]", ''USC News'' (2 October 2005, accessed 20 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th and 21st centuries, the fortepiano has enjoyed a revival as a result of the trend for historically informed performance, with the works of Beethoven and Schubert being played on fortepiano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haskell|first1=Harry|title=The Early Music Revival: A History|date=1988|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486291628|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bGG22O24ObAC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20fortepiano&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*alto viol (about the size of a [[viola]])
*treble or descant viol (about the size of a [[violin]]).

Among the foremost modern players of the viols are [[Paolo Pandolfo]], [[Wieland Kuijken]], [[Jordi Savall]], [[John Hsu]], and [[Vittorio Ghielmi]]. There are many modern [[viol consort]]s.

===Recorder===
{{Main|List of recorder players}}
[[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s in multiple sizes (contra-bass, bass, tenor, alto, soprano, the sopranino, and the even smaller kleine sopranino or garklein) are often played today in consorts of mixed size. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], among others, wrote solo works for the recorder. [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] did much to revive the recorder as a serious concert instrument, reconstructing a "consort of recorders (descant, treble, tenor and bass) all at low pitch and based on historical originals".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Blood, "[http://www.dolmetsch.com/Dolworks.htm The Dolmetsch Story]", ''Dolmetsch Online'' (26 September 2013, accessed 20 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singing==
[[File:Christina Pluhar, Philippe Jaroussky - Misteria Paschalia 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Countertenor]] [[Philippe Jaroussky]], accompanied by [[Christina Pluhar]] ([[theorbo]])]]
As with instrumental technique, the approach to historically informed performance practice for singers has been shaped by musicological research and academic debate.  In particular, there was debate around the use of the technique of [[vibrato]] at the height of the Early music revival, and many advocates of HIP aimed to eliminate vibrato in favour of the "pure" sound of straight-tone singing. The difference in style may be demonstrated by the sound of a [[boy treble]] in contrast to the sound of a [[Grand opera]] singer such as [[Maria Callas]].&lt;ref name="malafronte"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malafronte|first1=Judith|title=Vibrato Wars|url=https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VibratoWars-1.pdf|website=www.earlymusicamerica.org|publisher=Early Music America|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306103109/https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VibratoWars-1.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2018|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain historic vocal techniques have gained in popularity, such as ''[[Trill (music)#Trillo|trillo]]'', a [[tremolo]]-like repetition of a single note that was used for ornamental effect in the early Baroque era. Academic understanding of these expressive devices is often subjective however, as many vocal techniques discussed by treatise writers in the 17th and 18th centuries have different meanings, depending on the author. Despite the fashion for straight tone, many prominent Early music singers make use of a subtle, gentle form of vibrato to add expression to their performance.&lt;ref name="malafronte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802086143|page=150|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20singing%20technique&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|chapter=Vocal Tremulousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the singers who have contributed to the historically informed performance movement are [[Emma Kirkby]], [[Max van Egmond]], [[Julianne Baird]], [[Nigel Rogers]], and [[David Thomas (singer)|David Thomas]].

The resurgence of interest in Early music, particularly in sacred renaissance polyphony and Baroque opera, has driven a revival of the [[countertenor]] voice. High-voice male singers are often cast in preference to female [[contralto]]s in HIP opera productions, partly as a substitute for [[castrato]] singers. [[Alfred Deller]] is considered to have been a pioneer of the modern revival of countertenor singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countertenor|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/countertenor/|website=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306145032/http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/countertenor/|archivedate=6 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading contemporary performers include [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]], [[Derek Lee Ragin]], [[Andreas Scholl]], [[Michael Chance]], [[Drew Minter]], [[Daniel Taylor (countertenor)|Daniel Taylor]], [[Brian Asawa]], [[Yoshikazu Mera]], and [[Philippe Jaroussky]].

==Layout==
Standard practice concerning the layout of a group of performers, for example in a choir or an orchestra, has changed over time. Determining a historically appropriate layout of singers and instruments on a performance stage may be informed by historical research. In addition to documentary evidence, musicologists may also turn to [[Iconography|iconographic evidence]] — contemporary paintings and drawings of performing musicians — as a [[primary source]] for historic information. Pictorial sources may reveal various practices such as the size of an ensemble; the position of various types of instruments; their position in relation to a choir or keyboard instrument; the position or absence of a conductor; whether the performers are seated or standing; and the performance space (such as a concert hall, palace chamber, domestic house, church, or outdoors etc.).{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}} The German theorist [[Johann Mattheson]], in a 1739 treatise, states that the singers should stand in front of the instrumentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Mattheson 1739, {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main layouts are documented:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
* Circle (Renaissance)
* Choir in the front of the instruments (17th–19th century)
* Singers and instruments next to each other on the choir loft.

==Recovering early performance practices==
[[File:L’Orfeo. Favola in musica. Reprint of the First Edition of the Score, Venice 1609 - Toccata.jpg|thumb|Reprint of the 1st Edition of Monteverdi's ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1609); musicologists refer to [[Music manuscript|autograph scores]] or early editions to interpret performance practice]]
[[File:Cantiga bowed plucked lutes.jpg|thumb|Historical images, such as this Galician 13th-century illustration of lutanists, can inform modern performance practice, but must be interpreted with caution]]

===Interpreting musical notation===
Some familiar difficult items are as follows:

*Early composers often wrote using the same symbols as today, yet in a different meaning, often context-dependent. For example, what is written as an [[appoggiatura]] is often meant to be longer or shorter than the notated length.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. E. Bach, ''Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen'', Berlin 1753: Teil 1, Section 2 Par. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The notation may be partial. E.g., the note durations may be omitted altogether, such as in [[unmeasured prelude]]s, pieces written without [[Beats per minute|rhythm]] or [[Measure (music)|metre]] indications.
*The music may be written using alternative, non-modern notations, such as [[tablature]]. Some tablature notations are only partially decoded, such as the notation&lt;ref&gt;Peter Greenhill, ''The Robert ap Huw Manuscript: An Exploration of its Possible Solutions'', 5 vols. (all), Bangor: University of Wales, CAWMS dissertation, 1995-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; in the harp manuscript&lt;ref&gt;Thurston Dart, "Robert ap Huw's Manuscript of Welsh Harp Music", ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol 21 (1963). {{JSTOR|841428}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Robert ap Huw]].
*The reference [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of earlier music cannot generally be interpreted as designating the same pitch used today.
*Various tuning systems ([[Musical temperament|temperament]]s), are used. Composers always assume the player will choose the temperament, and never indicate it in the score.&lt;ref&gt;"Stimmung und Temperatur", in F. Zaminer, ed., ''Geschichte der Musiktheorie'', Vol. 6: "Hören, Messen und Rechnen in der Frühen Neuzeit", Darmstadt, Germany: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft (1987) {{ISBN|978-3534012060}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most ensemble music up to the early Baroque, the actual musical instruments to be used are not indicated in the score, and must be partially or totally chosen by the performers. A well-discussed example can be found in Monteverdi's ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', where the indications on which instruments to use are partial and limited to critical sections only.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Glover, "Solving the Musical Problem" in John Whenham (ed.) ''Claudio Monteverdi: Orfeo'', 138-155. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-521-24148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Issues of pronunciation, that impact on musical accents, carry over to church [[Latin]], the language in which a large amount of early vocal music was written. The reason is that Latin was customarily pronounced using the speech sounds and patterns of the [[Latin regional pronunciation|local]] vernacular language.

===Mechanical music===
Some information about how music sounded in the past can be obtained from contemporary mechanical instruments. For instance, the Dutch [[Museum Speelklok]] owns an 18th-century mechanical organ of which the music programme was composed and supervised by [[Joseph Haydn]].&lt;ref&gt;Rob van der Hilst, "[http://www.derecensent.nl/recensies/haydnh.htm Fluitekruid van Joseph Haydn]", review of Jan Jaap Haspels, Marije Hulleman, and Bob van Wely, ''Haydn herboren: 12 originele opnamen uit 1793'' (Utrecht: Nationaal Museum van Speelklok tot Pierement, 2004), {{ISBN|90-801699-3-5}}. ''De Recensent.nl'' (2004, accessed January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuning and pitch===
Until modern era, different tuning references have been used in different venues. The baroque oboist Bruce Haynes has extensively investigated surviving wind instruments and even documented a case of violinists having to retune by a minor third to play at neighboring churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Haynes, "Pitch Standards in the Baroque and Classical Periods" (diss., U. of Montreal, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2009}}

===Iconographic evidence===
The research of musicologists often overlaps with the work of [[art historian]]s; by examining paintings and drawings of performing musicians contemporary to a particular musical era, academics can infer details about performance practice of the day. In addition to showing the layout of an orchestra or ensemble, a work of art may reveal detail about contemporary playing techniques, for example the manner of [[Violin technique#Bowing techniques|holding a bow]] or a wind player's [[embouchure]]. However, just as an art historian must evaluate a work of art, a scholar of musicology must also assess the musical evidence of a painting or illustration in its historical context, taking into consideration the potential cultural and political motivations of the artist and allow for [[artistic license]]. An historic image of musicians may present an idealised or even fictional account of musical instruments, and there is as much a risk that it may give rise to a historically misinformed performance.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

==Issues==
[[File:John Eliot Gardiner at rehearsal in Wroclaw.jpg|thumb|Many scholars and performers such as [[John Eliot Gardiner]] have questioned the terminology of "authentic performance"]]
Prior to audio and video recording, no direct record of performing arts survives. Opinions on the implications of these motivations and on how they should translate into criteria for historically informed performance vary.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Lawson and Robin Stowell (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Musical Performance'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2012):{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;!--If a parenthetical "all", now removed, was meant to say this entire book verifies the claim that informed opinion vary, this is an opinion about the book by someone else--i.e, Original Research, unless a specific source is named for the opinion.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the [[early music]] revival, awareness of the pitfalls was clear. Though championing the need (for example in his editorship of Scarlatti sonatas) for a thoroughly informed approach, not least in understanding as fully as possible a composer's actual wishes and intentions in their historical context, [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]], while pioneering the harpsichord rediscovery, highlights the risk of using historical exoterism to hide technical incompetence: "too often historical authenticity can be used as a means of escape from any potentially disquieting observance of esthetic values, and from the assumption of any genuine artistic responsibility. The abdication of esthetic values and artistic responsibilities can confer a certain illusion of simplicity on what the passage of history has presented to us, bleached as white as bones on the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kirkpatrick, ''Interpreting Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2010}}

Classical recording producer Michael Sartorius writes: "While the debate on authenticity in baroque performance will continue, certain essential characteristics should be present, if the performance is to reflect the true baroque spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sartorius, "Baroque Music Performance: 'Authentic' or 'Traditional': A Discussion of the Essential Issues Involved", http://www.baroquemusic.org/barperf.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars see the HIP movement essentially as a 20th-century invention. Writing about the periodical ''Early Music'' (one of the leading periodicals about historically informed performance), Peter Hill noted "All the articles in ''Early Music'' noted in varying ways the (perhaps fatal) flaw in the 'authenticity' position. This is that the attempt to understand the past in terms of the past is—paradoxically—an absolutely contemporary phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hill, "'Authenticity in Contemporary Music," ''Tempo'' New Series no. 159 (December 1986), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of the Early music revival have distanced themselves from the terminology of "authentic performance". Conductor John Eliot Gardiner has expressed the view that the term can be "misleading", and has stated, "My enthusiasm for period instruments is not antiquarian or in pursuit of a spurious and unattainable authenticity, but just simply as a refreshing alternative to the standard, monochrome qualities of the symphony orchestra."&lt;ref name="billboard-gardiner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube-gardniner"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Eliot Gardiner: Why the Word "Authentic" Bothers Him|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym9oxgr3EnU|website=YouTube|publisher=Carnegie Hall|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more skeptical voices of the historically informed performance movement has been [[Richard Taruskin]]. His thesis is that the practice of unearthing supposedly historically informed practices is actually a 20th-century practice influenced by modernism and, ultimately, we can never know what music sounded like or how it was played in previous centuries. "What we had been accustomed to regard as historically authentic performances, I began to see, represented neither any determinable historical prototype nor any coherent revival of practices coeval with the repertories they addressed. Rather, they embodied a whole wish list of modern(ist) values, validated in the academy and the marketplace alike by an eclectic, opportunistic reading of historical evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, "Last Thoughts First," ''Text and Act'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
"'Historical' performers who aim 'to get to the truth'...by using period instruments and reviving lost playing techniques actually pick and choose from history's wares. And they do so in a manner that says more about the values of the late twentieth century than about those of any earlier era."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, "The Modern Sound of Early Music," ''Text and Act'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Leech-Wilkinson concedes that much of the HIP practice is based on invention: "Historical research may provide us with instruments, and sometimes even quite detailed information on how to use them; but the gap between such evidence and a sounding performance is still so great that it can be bridged only by a large amount of musicianship and invention. Exactly how much is required can easily be forgotten, precisely because the exercise of musical invention is so automatic to the performer."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, "'What we are doing with early music is genuinely authentic to such a small degree that the word loses most of its intended meaning'" ''Early Music,'' vol. 12, no. 1 (February 1984), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leech Wilkinson concludes that performance styles in early music "have as much to do with current taste as with accurate reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, "'What we are doing with early music is genuinely authentic to such a small degree that the word loses most of its intended meaning'" ''Early Music,'' vol.&amp;nbsp;12, no.&amp;nbsp;1 (February 1984), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'', [[Lydia Goehr]] discusses the aims and fallacies of both proponents and critics of the HIP movement.&lt;ref name="Lydia Goehr pp. 279"&gt;Lydia Goehr, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press), pp.&amp;nbsp;279–84.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that the HIP movement itself came about during the latter half of the 19th century as a reaction to the way modern techniques were being imposed upon music of earlier times. Thus performers were concerned with achieving an "authentic" manner of performing music—a 19th-century ideal that carries implications for all those involved with music. She distills the late 20th century arguments into two points of view, achieving either fidelity to the conditions of performance, or fidelity to the musical work.&lt;ref name="Lydia Goehr pp. 279"/&gt;

She succinctly summarizes the critics' arguments (for example, anachronistic, selectively imputing current performance ideas on early music), but then concludes that what the HIP movement has to offer is a different manner of looking at and listening to music: "It keeps our eyes open to the possibility of producing music in new ways under the regulation of new ideals. It keeps our eyes open to the inherently critical and revisable nature of our regulative concepts. Most importantly, it helps us overcome that deep‐rooted desire to hold the most dangerous of beliefs, that we have at any time got our practices absolutely right."&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Goehr, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press), p.&amp;nbsp;284. Goehr acknowledges the following writings informed her arguments: Theodor Adorno, "Bach Defended Against his Devotees," ''Prisms'' (London: N. Spearman, 1967), p. 135-146; Lawrence Dreyfus, "Early Music Defended Against Its Devotees: A Theory of Historical Performance in the Twentieth Century", ''Musical Quarterly'' 69 (1983), 297–322; Harry Haskell, ''The Early Music Revival'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1988) {{ISBN|9780500014493}}; Nicholas Kenyon (ed.), ''Authenticity and Early Music: A Symposium'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780198161523}}); Joseph Kerman, ''Contemplating Music: Challenges to Musicology'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985 {{ISBN|9780674166776}}), chapter 6; Michael Morrow, "Musical Performance", ''Early Music'' 6 (1978), 233–46; Charles Rosen, "Should Music Be Played "Wrong"?", ''High Fidelity'' 21 (1971), 54–58; and Richard Taruskin, et al., "The Limits of Authenticity: A Discussion", ''Early Music'' 12 (1984), 3–25, 523–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his book, ''The Aesthetics of Music'', the British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that "the effect [of HIP] has frequently been to cocoon the past in a wad of phoney scholarship, to elevate musicology over music, and to confine Bach and his contemporaries to an acoustic time-warp. The tired feeling which so many 'authentic' performances induce can be compared to the atmosphere of a modern museum.... [The works of early composers] are arranged behind the glass of authenticity, staring bleakly from the other side of an impassable screen".&lt;ref&gt;''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/89273 Oed.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "humanist" also describes the philosophical position of [[humanism]], which some "[[antihumanism|antihumanist]]" scholars in the humanities refuse. The Renaissance scholars and artists were also called [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]]. Some [[secondary school]]s offer humanities classes usually consisting of [[literature]], global studies and [[art]].

Human disciplines like history and [[cultural anthropology]] study subject matters that the manipulative [[experimental method]] does not apply to—and instead mainly use the [[comparative method]]&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[comparative research]].

==Fields==

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of humans", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the [[social sciences]], humanities and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural ''sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], physical or [[biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (άνθρωπος) is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences".

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies, or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist", to discuss humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Archaeology}}

Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts, and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.42.8 | issue=42 | title=The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004-2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Sinclair | first1 = Anthony }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.

Archaeology is thought of as a branch of [[anthropology]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |first1=William A. |last= Haviland |first2= Harald E. L. |last2= Prins |first3=Bunny |last3=McBride |first4=Dana |last4=Walrath |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2010 |edition=13th |isbn=0-495-81082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as [[history]].

===Classics===
[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the most famous Greek poet]]
[[Classics]], in the [[Western culture|Western]] academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of [[classical antiquity]], namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures. Classical studies is considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities; however, its popularity declined during the 20th century. Nevertheless, the influence of classical ideas on many humanities disciplines, such as philosophy and literature, remains strong.

===History===
[[History]] is systematically collected [[information]] about the [[past]]. When used as the name of a [[field of study]], ''history'' refers to the study and interpretation of the record of [[human]]s, [[society|societies]], institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.

Traditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern [[academia]], history is occasionally classified as a [[social science]].

===Linguistics and languages===
{{Main|Linguistics|Language}}
{{see also2|{{in title|language}}}}
While the scientific study of language is known as [[linguistics]] and is generally considered a [[social science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |title=Social Science Majors, University of Saskatchewan |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906113657/http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |archive-date=2015-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[natural science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|title=Language as a Natural Object; Linguistics as a Natural Science|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723173105/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as [[Wittgenstein]] claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including [[prose]] forms (such as the [[novel]]), [[poetry]] and [[drama]], also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a [[foreign language]] usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.

===Law and politics===
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]]]]{{Main|Law}} In common parlance, [[law]] means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is enforceable through institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crimes Against Humanity|first=Geoffrey| last=Robertson| authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|year=2006| publisher=Penguin|page=90| isbn=978-0-14-102463-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |title=The Concept of Law |year=1961 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Dworkin |title=Law's Empire |year=1986 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-51836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raz |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Raz |title=The Authority of Law |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-956268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=John |authorlink=John Austin (legal philosopher) |title=The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined |year=1831 |publisher= |location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every [[social science]] and discipline of the humanities. Laws are [[politic]]s, because politicians create them. Law is [[philosophy]], because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of [[history]]'s stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''LEX''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{main|Literature}}
[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|[[Shakespeare]] wrote some of the most acclaimed works in [[English literature]].]] '''Literature''' is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that foregrounds literariness, as opposed to [[ordinary language]]. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the term derives from [[Latin]] ''literatura/litteratura'' "writing formed with letters", although some definitions include [[Oral literature|spoken or sung texts]]. Literature can be classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]] or [[drama]]; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or expectations ([[genre]]).

===Philosophy===
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|The works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] overlap into many fields of the humanities, such as philosophy, literature, theology, music, and classical studies.]]
Philosophy—etymologically, the "love of wisdom"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments ([[experimental philosophy]] being an exception).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel (1987). ''What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy used to be a very comprehensive term, including what have subsequently become separate disciplines, such as [[physics]]. (As [[Immanuel Kant]] noted, "Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: physics, ethics, and logic.")&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1785). ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', the first line.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the main fields of philosophy are [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]]. Still, it continues to overlap with other disciplines. The field of [[semantics]], for example, brings philosophy into contact with [[linguistics]].

Since the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking [[universities]] has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more ''analytic.'' [[Analytic philosophy]] is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of [[symbolic logic|symbolic]] and/or [[mathematical logic]], as contrasted with the [[Continental philosophy|Continental style of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Brian Leiter [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp] "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt; This method of inquiry is largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G.E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Religion===
[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|The [[compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|creation]].]]
New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly around the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]] in [[India]], [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] being some of the earliest major faiths. In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander of Macedon]] in the 4th century BC.

[[Abrahamic religions]] are those [[religion]]s deriving from a common ancient tradition and traced by their adherents to [[Abraham]] (circa 1900 BCE), a [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] whose life is narrated in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]], where he is described as a [[prophet]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7), and in the [[Quran]], where he also appears as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]]. This forms a large group of related largely monotheistic religions, generally held to include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], and comprises over half of the world's religious adherents.

===Performing arts===
The [[performing art]]s differ from the [[visual arts]] in so far as the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some [[work of art|art object]]. Performing arts include [[acrobatics]], [[busking]], [[comedy]], [[dance]], [[film]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[juggling]], [[marching arts]], such as [[brass band]]s, and [[theatre]].

Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]], such as with [[costume]]s and [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc. There is also a specialized form of [[fine art]] in which the artists ''perform'' their work live to an audience. This is called [[Performance art]]. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. Dance was often referred to as a ''plastic art'' during the [[Modern dance]] era.

====Musicology====
[[File:Mozarteum grosser saal buehne mit orchester.jpg|thumb|Concert in the Mozarteum, Salzburg]]
[[Musicology]] as an academic discipline can take a number of different paths, including [[historical musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]] and [[music theory]]. Undergraduate music majors generally take courses in all of these areas, while graduate students focus on a particular path. In the liberal arts tradition, musicology is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.

====Theatre====
[[Theatre]] (or theater) (Greek "theatron", ''θέατρον'') is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]], [[mummers' play]]s, and [[pantomime]].

====Dance====
Dance (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', perhaps from [[Old Frankish language|Frankish]]) generally refers to [[human]] [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[Social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[Waggle dance|bee dance]], mating dance), and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (''the [[leaves]] danced in the [[wind]]''). [[Choreography]] is the art of creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]], and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]].
===Visual arts===

====History of visual arts====
[[File:Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain.jpg|thumbnail|''Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain'' by [[Emperor Gaozong of Song China|Emperor Gaozong]] (1107–1187) of [[Song Dynasty]]; fan mounted as album leaf on silk, four columns in cursive script.]]
The great traditions in [[art]] have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Japan]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[China]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|India]], [[Greater Nepal]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Mesoamerica]].

Ancient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g., [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt).

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. The [[Renaissance]] saw the return to valuation of the material world, and this shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.

Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.

Religious [[Islam]]ic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead. The physical and rational certainties depicted by the 19th-century Enlightenment were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but also by unprecedented technological development. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art.

====Media types====

=====Drawing=====
[[Drawing]] is a means of making a [[image|picture]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in [[technical drawing]] is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

=====Painting=====
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]
[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

Colour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including [[Goethe]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Isaac Newton]], have written their own [[colour theory|colour theories]]. Moreover, the use of language is only a generalization for a colour equivalent. The word "[[red]]", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as [[musical notation|C]] or [[musical notation|C#]] in music, although the [[Pantone]] system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.

Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. This began with [[cubism]] and is not painting in strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]] or [[wood]] for their [[Texture (painting)|texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]]. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of [[concept]]; this has led some {{Who|date=June 2011}} to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work.

==Origin of the term==
The word "humanities" is derived from the [[Renaissance Latin]] expression ''studia humanitatis'', or "study of ''[[humanitas]]''" (a classical Latin word meaning—in addition to "humanity"—"culture, refinement, education" and, specifically, an "education befitting a cultivated man"). In its usage in the early 15th century, the ''studia humanitatis'' was a course of studies that consisted of grammar, poetry, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy, primarily derived from the study of Latin and Greek classics. The word ''humanitas'' also gave rise to the Renaissance Italian neologism ''umanisti'', whence "humanist", "[[Renaissance humanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"humanism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 11 Apr. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275932/humanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the West, the study of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Bod, Rens; ''A New History of the Humanities'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During Roman times, the concept of the seven [[liberal arts]] evolved, involving [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] (the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]), along with [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astrology and astronomy|astronomy]] and [[music]] (the [[quadrivium]]).&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Albert W.; ''The Humanities Today'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; These subjects formed the bulk of [[medieval]] education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or "ways of doing".

A major shift occurred with the [[Renaissance humanism]] of the fifteenth century, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to study rather than practice, with a corresponding shift away from traditional fields into areas such as literature and history. In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] terms suitable for a [[democracy|democratic]] society since the Greek and Roman societies in which the humanities originated were not at all democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Walling, Donovan R.; ''Under Construction: The Role of the Arts and Humanities in Postmodern Schooling'' Phi Delta Kappa Educational Foundation, Bloomington, Indiana, 1997. Humanities comes from human&lt;/ref&gt; This was in keeping with the postmodernists' nuanced view of themselves as the culmination of history.

==Today==

=== Education and employment ===
For many decades, there has been a growing public perception that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=Richard H.|date=1997-03-01|title=Intention and Perceptions A National Survey of Public Attitudes Toward Liberal Arts Education|journal=Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning|volume=29|issue=2|pages=16–23|doi=10.1080/00091389709603100|issn=0009-1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common belief is that graduates from such programs face underemployment and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/27/hooray_for_worthless_education/|title=Hooray for "worthless" education!|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|website=Salon|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, humanities graduates find employment in a wide variety of management and professional occupations. In Britain, for example, over 11,000 humanities majors found employment in the following occupations:
* Education (25.8%)
* Management (19.8%)
* Media/Literature/Arts (11.4%)
* Law (11.3%)
* Finance (10.4%)
* Civil service (5.8%)
* Not-for-profit (5.2%)
* Marketing (2.3%)

===In the United States===
{{Main|Humanities in the United States}}

====The Humanities Indicators====
The [[Humanities Indicators]], unveiled in 2009 by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], are the first comprehensive compilation of data about the humanities in the United States, providing scholars, policymakers and the public with detailed information on humanities education from primary to higher education, the humanities workforce, humanities funding and research, and public humanities activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/ |title=American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Amacad.org |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/ |title=Humanities Indicators |publisher=Humanities Indicators |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled after the National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators, the Humanities Indicators are a source of reliable benchmarks to guide analysis of the state of the humanities in the United States.

If "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charette |first=Robert N. |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth – IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; statements about a "crisis" in the humanities are also misleading and ignore data of the sort collected by the Humanities Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Humanities-Scholars-See/140311/ Humanities Scholars See Declining Prestige, Not a Lack of Interest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Collection-of-Articles-and/140205/ Debating the State of the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Humanities in American Life''====
The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====As a major====

In 1950, a little over 1 percent of 22-year-olds in the United States had earned a humanities degrees (defined as a degree in English, language, history, philosophy); in 2010, this had doubled to about 2 and a half percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ben|title=A Crisis in the Humanities? (10 June 2013)|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/06/10/the-humanities-crisis/|website=The Chronicle|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this is because there was an overall rise in the number of Americans who have any kind of college degree. (In 1940, 4.6 percent had a four-year degree; in 2016, 33.4 percent had one.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Reid|title=Census: More Americans have college degrees than ever before|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/326995-census-more-americans-have-college-degrees-than-ever-before|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=The Hill|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a percentage of the type of degrees awarded, however, the humanities seem to be declining. Harvard University provides one example. In 1954, 36 percent of Harvard undergraduates majored in the humanities, but in 2012, only 20 percent took that course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Humanities Committee Sounds an Alarm|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/arts/humanities-committee-sounds-an-alarm.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University has documented that between 1990 to 2008, degrees in English, history, foreign languages, and philosophy have decreased from 8 percent to just under 5 percent of all U.S. college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-14/the-great-recession-never-ended-for-college-humanities|title=The Great Recession Never Ended for College Humanities|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=14 August 2018|website=Bloomberg|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In liberal arts education====
[[The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences]] 2013 report ''The Heart of the Matter'' supports the notion of a broad "[[Liberal arts colleges|liberal arts education]]", which includes study in disciplines from the natural sciences to the arts as well as the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/18/humanities-social-sciences-column/2436093/ Humanities, social sciences critical to our future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/428644/august-15-2013/richard-brodhead Colbert Report: The humanities do pay]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[colleges]] provide such an education; some require it. The [[University of Chicago]] and [[Columbia University]] were among the first schools to require an extensive [[core curriculum]] in philosophy, literature, and the arts for all students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], "The Problem of General Education," in ''The Marketplace of Ideas'' (W. W. Norton, 2010), especially pp. 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other colleges with nationally recognized, mandatory programs in the liberal arts are [[Fordham University]], [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]]. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. D. Hirsch, Jr.]].

====In the digital age====
Researchers in the humanities have developed numerous large- and small-scale digital corpora, such as digitized collections of historical texts, along with the digital tools and methods to analyze them. Their aim is both to uncover new knowledge about corpora and to visualize research data in new and revealing ways. Much of this activity occurs in a field called the [[digital humanities]].

====STEM====
Politicians in the United States currently espouse a need for increased funding of the [[STEM fields]], science, technology, engineering, mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |title=Whitehouse.gov |access-date=2014-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021222654/http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal funding represents a much smaller fraction of funding for humanities than other fields such as STEM or medicine.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"&gt;''America Is Raising A Generation Of Kids Who Can't Think Or Write Clearly'', [http://www.businessinsider.com/the-war-against-humanities-2013-6 Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a decline of quality in both college and pre-college education in the humanities field.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"/&gt;

Former four-term Louisiana Governor, [[Edwin Edwards]] (D), has recently acknowledged the importance of the humanities. In a video address&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUY5c9IrAHE YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; to the academic conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scedhs2014.uqam.ca/en/program.html Scedhs2014.uqam.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolutions in Eighteenth-Century Sociability'', Edwards said
:Without the humanities to teach us how history has succeeded or failed in directing the fruits of technology and science to the betterment of our tribe of ''homo sapiens'', without the humanities to teach us how to frame the discussion and to properly debate the uses-and the costs-of technology, without the humanities to teach us how to safely debate how to create a more just society with our fellow man and woman, technology and science would eventually default to the  ownership of—and misuse by—the most influential, the most powerful, the most feared among us.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8919778/Introductory_remarks_by_former_four-term_Louisiana_Governor_Edwin_W._Edwards_Honorary_Chair_Montreal_Enlightenment_Conference_October_18_2014 Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The value of the humanities debate====

The contemporary debate in the field of critical university studies centers around the declining value of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Collini]], "What Are Universities For?"(Penguin 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Small]], "The Value of the Humanities"(Oxford University Press 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; As in America, there is a perceived decline in interest within higher education policy in research that is qualitative and does not produce marketable products. This threat can be seen in a variety of forms across Europe, but much critical attention has been given to the field of research assessment in particular. For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave Communications 3, Article number: 17020 (2017)
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.20&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the notion of "impact" has generated significant debate.&lt;ref&gt;The Social Impact of the Arts http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230572553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulaitis|first=Zoe|year=2017|title=Measuring impact in the humanities: Learning from accountability and economics in a contemporary history of cultural value|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0002-7|journal=Palgrave Communications|via=|doi=10.1057/s41599-017-0002-7|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical history==

===Citizenship and self-reflection===

Since the late 19th century, a central justification for the humanities has been that it aids and encourages self-reflection—a self-reflection that, in turn, helps develop personal consciousness or an active sense of civic duty.

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Gadamer|Hans-Georg Gadamer]] centered the humanities' attempt to distinguish itself from the natural sciences in [[humankind]]'s urge to understand its own experiences. This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries extended that "narrative imagination"&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, Moira. "Narrative imagination and taking the perspective of others," ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'' 21, 4–5 (July, 2002), 407–416.&lt;/ref&gt; to the ability to understand the records of lived experiences outside of one's own individual social and cultural context. Through that narrative [[imagination]], it is claimed, humanities scholars and students develop a [[conscience]] more suited to the multicultural world we live in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum, Martha]]. ''[[Martha Nussbaum#Cultivating Humanity|Cultivating Humanity]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That conscience might take the form of a passive one that allows more effective [[self-reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harpham | first1 = Geoffrey | year = 2005 | title = Beneath and Beyond the Crisis of the Humanities | url = | journal = [[New Literary History]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 21–36 | doi=10.1353/nlh.2005.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extend into active empathy that facilitates the dispensation of civic duties a responsible world citizen must engage in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; There is disagreement, however, on the level of influence humanities study can have on an individual and whether or not the understanding produced in humanistic enterprise can guarantee an "identifiable positive effect on people."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanistic theories and practices===
There are three major branches of knowledge: [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and the humanities. [[Technology]] is the practical extension  of the natural sciences, as [[politics]] is the extension of the social sciences. Similarly, the humanities have their own practical extension, sometimes called "transformative humanities" (transhumanities) or "culturonics" ([[Mikhail Epstein]]'s term):
* Nature – natural sciences – technology –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;transformation of nature
* 
* Society – social sciences –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;politics&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;transformation of society
* 
* Culture – human sciences –&amp;nbsp;culturonics&amp;nbsp;– transformation of culture&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein. ''The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto''. New York and London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2012, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Technology, politics and culturonics are designed to transform what their respective disciplines study: nature, society, and culture. The field of transformative humanities includes various   practicies and technologies, for example, [[language planning]], the construction of new languages, like [[Esperanto]], and invention of new artistic and literary genres and movements in the genre of [[manifesto]], like [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], or [[Surrealism]].  Humanistic [[invention]] in the sphere of culture, as a practice complementary to scholarship, is an important aspect of the humanities.

===Truth and meaning===

The divide between humanistic study and natural sciences informs arguments of meaning in humanities as well. What distinguishes the humanities from the [[natural science]]s is not a certain subject matter, but rather the mode of approach to any question. Humanities focuses on understanding meaning, purpose, and goals and furthers the appreciation of singular historical and social phenomena—an interpretive method of finding "truth"—rather than explaining the causality of events or uncovering the truth of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its societal application, narrative imagination is an important tool in the (re)production of understood meaning in history, culture and literature.

Imagination, as part of the tool kit of artists or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a response from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] of lived experiences, no "absolute" knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. [[Poststructuralism]] has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} In the wake of [[Death of the author|the death of the author]] proclaimed by [[Barthes|Roland Barthes]], various theoretical currents such as [[deconstruction]] and [[discourse]] analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the [[hermeneutic]] subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism humanities scholarship is "unscientific" and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}}

===Pleasure, the pursuit of knowledge and scholarship===

Some, like [[Stanley Fish]], have claimed that the humanities can defend themselves best by refusing to make any claims of utility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fish|Fish, Stanley]], [http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#more-81 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; (Fish may well be thinking primarily of literary study, rather than history and philosophy.) Any attempt to justify the humanities in terms of outside benefits such as social usefulness (say increased productivity) or in terms of ennobling effects on the individual (such as greater wisdom or diminished prejudice) is ungrounded, according to Fish, and simply places impossible demands on the relevant academic departments. Furthermore, [[critical thinking]], while arguably a result of humanistic training, can be acquired in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/the-laws-of-cool-knowledge-work-and-the-culture-of-information-catalogue-copy-and-table-of-contents/ Alan Liu, ''Laws of Cool,'' 2004,]&lt;/ref&gt; And the humanities do not even provide any more the kind of social cachet (what sociologists sometimes call "[[cultural capital]]") that was helpful to succeed in Western society before the age of mass education following World War II.

Instead, scholars like Fish suggest that the humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge). Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets [[Jürgen Habermas]]' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which takes place in the bourgeois [[public sphere]]. In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists,{{who|date=May 2012}} is the foundation for modern democracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Others, like [[Mark Bauerlein]], argue that professors in the humanities have increasingly abandoned proven methods of [[epistemology]] (''I care only about the quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.'') in favor of [[indoctrination]] (''I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.''). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Romanticization and rejection===

Implicit in many of these arguments supporting the humanities are the makings of arguments against public support of the humanities. [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] asserts that we live in a changing world, a world where "cultural capital" is replaced with ''[[scientific literacy]]'', and in which the romantic notion of a Renaissance humanities scholar is obsolete. Such arguments appeal to judgments and anxieties about the essential uselessness of the humanities, especially in an age when it is seemingly vitally important for scholars of literature, history and the arts to engage in "collaborative work with experimental scientists or even simply to make "intelligent use of the findings from empirical science."&lt;ref&gt;""Theory," Anti-Theory, and Empirical Criticism," ''Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts'', Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner, eds., Lexington, Kentucky: ICUS Books, 1999, pp. 144–145. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of animal-human marriage has made appearances in several [[Mythology|mythological]] stories and [[folklore]], and is often understood to mean a deity-human marriage involving gods or heroes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alan L.|date=1995-01-01|title=The Woman Who Married a Horse: Five Ways of Looking at a Chinese Folktale|jstor=1178945|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=54|issue=2|pages=275–305|doi=10.2307/1178945}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese folktale 'The Goddess Of The Silkworm' is an example of a tale where a woman marries a horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar Irish legend tells of a king who marries a horse, symbolizing a divine union between the king and the goddess of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Y-7XvMVeYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography|last=Freeman|first=Philip|date=2004-03-17|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743267496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the indigenous [[Cheyenne]] have a story of animal-human marriage in 'The Girl who Married a dog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stensland|first=Anna Lee|date=1977-01-01|title=The Indian Presence in American Literature|jstor=815804|journal=The English Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=37–41|doi=10.2307/815804}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Native American stories about people who married animals. In these Native American myths, animal spirits frequently assume human form.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Mi-Ni/Native-American-Mythology.html|title=Native American Mythology - Myth Encyclopedia - god, story, legend, names, ancient, animal, snake, world, creation, life|website=www.mythencyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not seen as literal animals, but representatives from the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Animal-Human marriage in the real world ==
Although it is uncertain if there is a legal basis for marrying an animal, several individuals claim to have done so. The [[Sudanese goat marriage incident]] made big headlines in 2006 when a man was forced to marry a goat after being caught in a sexual interaction with the goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550479/Man-marries-goat-captivates-millions.html|title='Man marries goat' captivates millions|last=Staff|first=By Our Foreign|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of marriage include animals such as dogs, cats, frogs and a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3004930.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} South Asia {{!}} Girl weds dog to break 'evil spell'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/11/13/man-in-india-marries-dog-to-atone-for-stoning-to-death-mating-canines.html|title=Man in India Marries Dog to Atone for Stoning to Death Mating Canines|date=2007-11-13|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html|title=Sealed with a kiss: Man 'marries' his dog in sunset ceremony - but assures guests 'it's not sexual'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658327.stm|title=BBC News - German man 'marries' his dying cat|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4290761/Seven-year-old-Indian-girls-marry-frogs.html|title=Seven-year-old Indian girls 'marry' frogs|last=Delhi|first=By Dean Nelson in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/01/03/british-woman-marries-dolphin.html|title=British Woman Marries Dolphin|date=2006-01-03|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents of human animal relations took place in 2010, when 18-year-old Balinese man Ngurah Alit was found having sexual intercourse with a cow, who he claimed flirted with him.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/bali-teenager-passes-out-marrying-cow-he-had-sex-with/|title=Bali Teenager Passes Out Marrying Cow He Had Sex With {{!}} Jakarta Globe|work=Jakarta Globe|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Pecaruan ritual, the man was forced to marry the animal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The ceremony was thought to cleanse the village of the immoral act of bestiality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The cow was drowned in the ocean, while Alit was symbolically drowned as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[File:Händelgesellschaft volume01 page 009.jpg|thumb|Page from Händelgesellschaft volume 1 (1858) – showing the work contained in the volume: Handel's oratorio ''[[Susanna (Handel)|Susanna]]'']]

Between 1858 and 1902, the '''Händel-Gesellschaft''' ("'''German Handel Society'''") produced a collected 105-volume edition of the [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel|works]] of [[George Frideric Handel]]. Even though the collection was initiated by the society, many of the volumes were published by [[Friedrich Chrysander]] working alone (Chrysander was the major contributor for almost all of the volumes). The wording on the title page of the volumes is "''Georg Friedrich Händel's Werke. Ausgabe der Deutschen Händelgesellschaft''" which translates as "Georg Friedrich Handel's works. Edition of the German Handel Society". Chrysander's work has been criticised, however the scale of his achievement is also praised. The collection's abbreviation of "'''HG'''" can be used to identify individual works by Handel; for example Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' can be referred to as "HG xlv" (with the Roman numerals "xlv" indicating that the work is in volume 45).&lt;ref&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Hicks|vol=x|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; For practical use, the HG system has been superseded by the [[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] numbering system. The 105 volumes do not contain the complete works of Handel—with at least 250 of his works unpublished in the collection.

==History==
Before the Händelgesellschaft, at least two collected editions of Handel's works had been produced. [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]]'s 180-volume collection was produced between 1787 and 1797—however, it was far from complete, and included, for example, only five of Handel's 42 Italian [[List of operas by Handel|opera]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Winton Dean, ''The New Grove Handel.'' NY: Norton, 1982, p. 116. {{ISBN|0-393-30086-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other major collection was produced by the English Handel Society (founded by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]) between 1843 and 1858—however, it too was incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm History of the HHA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the Händel-Gesellschaft was founded by Chrysander and the literary historian [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] (with Chrysander the only active editor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfhandel.org/chron4.htm gfhandel.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123123543/http://gfhandel.org/chron4.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The society==
Despite the reference to a "society" in the name of the ''Händel-Gesellschaft'' (including a [[board of directors]]), the edition was produced almost entirely by Chrysander, who carried on publication of the edition even when the society dropped out of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gfhandel.org/edition.htm "Editions of Handel's Music"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310153712/http://gfhandel.org/edition.htm |date=2007-03-10 }} from gfhandel.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysander set up an office in the garden at his home, and from 1862 onwards personally superintended the engraving and printing of the edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicaltimes.co.uk/archive/misc/chrysander.html ''Karl Franz Friedrich Chrysander''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929024555/http://www.musicaltimes.co.uk/archive/misc/chrysander.html |date=September 29, 2006 }}--October 1901 obituary from ''[[The Musical Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he sold fruits and vegetables raised in his garden to derive further income during the years of publication.&lt;ref&gt;"Editions of Handel's Music," ''op. cit..''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume (1858) was prepared by [[Julius Rietz]] (although with results that displeased Chrysander).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoasm.org/X/HandelScores.html "Handel's Scores,"] at WBAI'S "Here Of A Sunday Morning" website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Seiffert]] assisted with some of the later editing.&lt;ref&gt;"Editions of Handel's Music," ''op. cit..''&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its being more comprehensive than previous collections, the ''Händel-Gesellschaft'' edition was long considered the standard reference for Handel's works. When the ''[[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]'' was inaugurated in 1955, it was at first intended as a supplement to Chrysander's work, and only later (in 1958) became a full critical edition in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''op. cit.,'' p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Should add something about how the publication was a money-making venture—with the expectation that subscriptions would be sought from the public for the volumes. Subscription cost? --&gt;

==Criticism==
Some have criticised Chrysander's efforts, with one writer commenting that "he was an autocrat, a law into himself, who often made his selection according to his desires, who altered and revised at will, and who even falsified documents to suit his purposes,"&lt;ref&gt;"Handel's Scores," ''op. cit..'',&lt;/ref&gt; and another criticising his "arbitrary selection of material in the more complex works and his failure to explain his methods."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''op. cit..''&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also problems such as the renumbering of the chamber sonatas originally published by Handel as his Op. 1 and Op. 2; for example, the Trio sonata in B flat for two violins and continuo, Op. 2 no. 3, appears in the ''Händel-Gesellschaft'' edition as Op. 2 no. 4. These renumberings by Chrysander resulted in confusion which still persists.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''op. cit.,'' pp. 117 and p. 153 (work list reference to Handel trio sonata).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition]]'' comments that "The complete edition of the German ''Handelgesellschaft'' suffers from being the work of one man who would not recognize that his task was beyond any single man's power ... Yet Chrysander's services in the restoration of Handel are beyond praise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Handel, George Frederick |volume=12 |page=915 |first=Donald Francis |last=Tovey |authorlink=Donald Tovey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the society==
[[File:Händelgesellschaft volume01 Page 013.jpg|thumb|Volume 1, page 13 of the Händelgesellschaft (1858) – detailing the structure of the society]]
At the time of the publication of the first volume of the Händelgesellschaft in 1858, the society was run by directors and a committee. The following details were taken from information printed in the first volume:

===Directors===
The directors (German: directorium) were:
*Jul. Rietz, Vorsitzender (president)
*M. Hauptmann, Sekretaer (secretary)
*[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], Cassirer
*Fr. Chrysander
*G. G. Gervinus

===Committee===
The 27 committee members (German: ausschuss) were:

The structure of the society was printed in the following fifteen volumes: 1, 5, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 23, 28, 34, 36, 56, 65, 71 and 76.

==Volumes==
The publications were labelled as "Lieferung" (which is German for "consignment" or "delivery") followed by a Roman numeral indicating the volume number. For example, the fourth volume (containing the oratorio ''Hercules'') was labelled as "Lieferung IV". The volumes are also sometimes referred to as "Bands".

Unless stated in the table below, Chrysander wrote a foreword for each volume. All volumes are in German, however most (again indicated below) include various English translations. Where a volume contains more than one work, the ordering of the HWV numbers indicate the order in which the works were published within the volume. The original German spelling of the volume titles has been retained.

The 105 volumes (which includes six supplement volumes) published in the Händelgesellschaft are (note that volume 49 was never published):

'''Leopold Blaschka''' (27 May 1822 – 3 July 1895) and his son '''Rudolf Blaschka''' (17 June 1857 – 1 May 1939) were [[Dresden, Germany]] glass artists native to the Bohemian (Czech)–German borderland, known for the production of biological models such as the [[glass sea creatures]] and  Harvard University's [[Glass Flowers]].

==Born to glass==
The Blaschka family traces its roots to [[Josefův Důl (Jablonec nad Nisou District)|Josefuv Dul]] (Antoniwald) in the Iser or [[Izera Mountains]], a region known for processing glass, metals and gems&lt;ref name="urania"/&gt; and members of the family had worked in [[Venice]],&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; [[Bohemia]], and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Sigwart, Julia D. "Crystal creatures: context for the Dublin Blaschka Congress." Historical Biology 20.1 (2008): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvell, Drew 2016"&gt;Harvell, Drew, and Greene, Harry W. A Sea of Glass: Searching for the Blaschkas&amp;Apos; Fragile Legacy in an Ocean at Risk Organisms and Environments 13. University Of California Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Leopold referred to this history in an 1889 letter to [[Mary Lee Ware]]:
{{blockquote|Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation. The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass; then he is to have a son with like tastes; he is to be your grandfather. He in turn will have a son who must, as your father, be passionately fond of glass. You, as his son, can then try your hand, and it is your own fault if you do not succeed. But, if you do not have such ancestors, it is not your fault. My grandfather was the most widely known glassworker in Bohemia.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vitreous tract" /&gt;}}

Born in [[Český Dub]], [[Bohemia]], and one of [[Joseph Blaschke]]'s three sons,&lt;ref name="Harvell, Drew 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.cz/ghmags/2010/ghmag_2010_1-2_article-6.pdf|title=Heraldika a genealogie č. 1 - 2/2010|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold, alone of his brothers, displayed the necessary artistic skills as a child, and was apprenticed to a [[goldsmith]] and [[gemcutter]] in [[Turnov]], a town in the [[Liberec Region]] of today's Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; He then joined the family business, which produced glass ornaments and [[glass eye]]s.&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; He developed a technique which he termed "glass-spinning", which permitted the construction of highly precise and detailed works in glass. He also [[Latinised]] his family name to "Blaschka", and began to focus the business on the manufacture of glass eyes.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;

Leopold married Caroline Zimmermann in 1846 and within four years their son Josef Augustin Blaschka was born.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt;
Caroline and Josef died of cholera in a 1850, and a year later his father died. Heartbroken, Leopold "sought consolation in the natural world, sketching the plants in the countryside around his home."&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Rudolf and Leopold Blaschka - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHOx5H5vNx4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt;

==Glass marine invertebrates==
{{main|Glass sea creatures}}
[[File:Blaschka 4.jpg|thumb|right|Blaschka model of jellyfish]]
In 1853, Leopold traveled to the United States. En route the ship was delayed at sea for two weeks by lack of wind.&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates" /&gt; During this time Leopold studied and sketched local [[marine invertebrate]], intrigued by the glass-like transparency of their bodies.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; He wrote:
{{blockquote|It is a beautiful night in May. Hopefully, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it is surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure.&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates" /&gt;}}

On return to [[Dresden]], Leopold focused on his family business. In 1854 he married Caroline Riegel&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; - producing glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other such fancy goods and specialty items that only a master [[Lampworking|lampworker]] could accomplish.&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria" /&gt; However, like anyone, he did have free time, and his hobby was to make glass models of plants – as opposed to invertebrates. This would, many years later, become a base for the fabled ''Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants'' (otherwise known as the [[Glass Flowers]]), but, for the moment, such artistry was naught but an amusing and profitless pastime done between his various commissions.&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria"/&gt; Yet, unsurprisingly, given their stunning quality, this amusing hobby – itself born out of seeking consolation in nature upon his first wife's death – attracted attention. Aristocratic attention, as it turned out, specifically the eyes of Prince Camille de [[House of Rohan|Rohan]] who arranged to meet with Leopold at [[Sychrov Castle]] in  1857 - the same year that the Leopold &amp; Caroline's son Rudolf was born.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; Being something of a naturalist himself, the Prince commissioned Leopold to craft 100 glass [[orchid]]s for his private collection &lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; and, being more than a little impressed by the mastery Leopold's work, in 1862, "the prince exhibited about 100 models of orchids and other exotic plants, which he displayed on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague,"&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; a fateful act which brought the skill of the Blaschkas to the attention of another - man whom the Prince had actually once introduced to Leopold: a certain Professor [[Ludwig Reichenbach]].&lt;ref name="sciencefriday" /&gt;

The director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Prof. Reichenbach, was enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own inability to properly showcase marine invertebrates, for in the 19th century the only practiced method of showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol.&lt;ref name="cmog archive" /&gt; This of course killed it but, more importantly, time and their lack of hard parts eventually rendered them into little more than colorless floating blobs of jelly. Neither pretty nor a terribly effective teaching tool, the Dresden museum director desired something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria"/&gt; and thus, in 1863&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencefriday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berlin" /&gt; These marine models, hailed as "an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,"&lt;ref name="wales" /&gt; were a great improvement on previous methods of presenting such creatures: drawings, pressing, photographs and [[papier-mâché]] or wax models.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;

Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; - advice which prompted the swiftly and highly lucrative mail-order business that followed. Indeed, "the world had never seen anything quite like the beautiful, scientifically accurate Blaschka models"&lt;ref name="atlasobscura" /&gt; and yet they were available via so common a means as via mail-order per one's local card catalog. Not glorious, perhaps, but highly effective, and museums and universities began purchasing them en masse to put on display much as Prof. Reichenbach had - for natural history museum directors the world over had the same marine invertebrate showcasing problem.&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates"/&gt; In short, Blaschkas Glass sea creature mail-order enterprise succeeded for two reasons: 1- there was a huge and global demand; 2- they were the only and best glass artists capable of crafting literally scientifically flawless models. Initially the designs for these were based on drawings in books, but Leopold was soon able to use his earlier drawings to produce highly detailed models of other species,&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; and his reputation quickly spread; the task additionally furthering the training of his son and apprentice (and eventual successor), Rudolf Blaschka.&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; Indeed, a year after the success of the glass sea anemones, the family moved to family moved to [[Dresden]] to give young Rudolf better educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;

In 1886, [[Edouard Van Beneden]], founder of the Institute of Zoology, ordered 77 Blaschka models in order to illustrate zoology lessons. Some of these models are still on display at TréZOOr, in the Aquarium-Muséum in [[Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aquarium-museum.uliege.be/en/a-decouvrir/museum/trezoor/ TréZOOr Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact with Harvard==
[[File:GlassFlowers1HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the Harvard Glass Flowers collection]]
In about 1880, Rudolf began assisting his father with the models. In that year, they produced 131 Glass sea creature models for the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] Society of Natural History Museum (now the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]]). These models, along with the ones purchased by [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], were seen by Professor [[George Lincoln Goodale]], who was in the process of setting up the [[Harvard Botanical Museum]]. In 1886 the Blaschkas were approached by Goodale, who had come to Dresden for the sole purpose of finding them, with a request to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; some reports claim that Goodale saw a few glass orchids in the room where they met, surviving from the work two decades earlier.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; Leopold was unwilling as his current business of selling Glass sea creatures was hugely successful but, eventually, the famed glass artists agreed to send test-models to the U.S. and, although badly damaged by U.S. [[Customs]],&lt;ref name="cmog flowers" /&gt; Goodale nonetheless appreciated the fragmentary craftwork and showed them widely – convinced that Blaschka glass art was a more than worthy educational investment. His reasons for wanting the models was simple: At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study. As such, Goodale wanted the best, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens — a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color. Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools.&lt;ref name="harvard flowers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goodale" /&gt; However, having already seen Harvard's recently procured glass marine invertebrates, Professor Goodale - like Professor Reichenbach before him - realized that glass flowers would solve his problem&lt;ref name="goodale" /&gt; – for, as glass, they were three-dimensional and would retain their color.

[[File:Glass Flowers gift-bouquet.jpg|thumb|right|A photo of the bouquet of glass flowers which, in 1889, Leopold Blaschka made and gifted to Elizabeth C. and Mary L. Ware which, at some later date, was given to Harvard and is now part of the Glass Flowers exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi-Wilcox, Susan M. "A Brief History of Harvard's Glass Flowers Collection and Its Development." Journal of Glass Studies (2015): 197-211.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Investments require funds, and to cover the expensive enterprise Goodale approached his former student [[Mary Lee Ware]] and her mother [[Elizabeth Cabot (Lee) Ware|Elizabeth C. Ware]]; they were independently wealthy and already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt; Mary convinced her mother to agree to underwrite the consignment of the uncannily lifelike models that enchanted them both.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; In 1887 the Blaschkas contracted to spend half-time producing the models for Harvard.&lt;ref name="emison"/&gt; They continued to spend their remaining time making marine invertebrate models. However, in 1890 the Blaschkas insisted that it was impossible to craft the botanical models for half the year and the sea creatures the other half; "they said that they must give up either one or the other."&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, that same year the Blaschkas signed an exclusive ten-year contract with Harvard to make [[Glass Flowers|glass flowers]] for 8,800 marks per year.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; New arrangements were also made to send the models directly to Harvard, where museum staff could open them safely, observed by Customs staff.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; They modeled a great range of plants (finally, 164 taxonomic families) and plant parts (flowers, leaves, fruits, roots). Some were shown during [[pollination]] by insects, others diseased in various ways.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; Prof. Goodale noted that the activity of the Blaschkas was "greatly increased by their exclusive devotion to a single a single line of work."&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to Leopold's feelings for the Glass Flowers enterprise, and the change to it from the successful marine creature business, Goodale wrote the following in the ''Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891'':
{{blockquote|It has been only within a comparatively short time that I have discovered the cause of the great reluctance of the elder Blaschka to the undertaking at the outset. It appears upon inquiry that he had constructed a few models of plants before beginning the preparation of the animal models to which he owes his wide celebrity; but these models of plants were, he thought, not appreciated by the persons for whom he had made them. The first set of models passed through various vicissitudes, and finally found a home in the Natural History Museum in [[Liege]], where they were at last destroyed by fire. The artist did not have courage to undertake the experiment again, when he was succeeding so well with his animal models. He regards it as a pleasant turn in his fortunes which permits him to devote all of his time to the subject of his earliest studies.&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Production of the Glass Flowers==
Early in the making of the Glass Flowers, Mary Lee Ware engaged in correspondence with Professor Goodale regarding the making of the collection, one of which contained a remark of Leopold's regarding the false rumor that secret methods were used in the making of the Glass Flowers: ''"Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation."''&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vitreous tract" /&gt; On this trend, he also once said that ''"One cannot hurry glass. It will take its own time. If we try to hasten it beyond its limits, it resists and no longer obeys us. We have to humor it."''&lt;ref&gt;Blaschka Plants Blend Science and Artistry (NYT) - https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-blaschka-plants-blend-science-and-artistry.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blaschkas used a mixture of clear and coloured glass, sometimes supported with wire, to produce their models.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; Many pieces were painted, this work being entirely given to Rudolf.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; In order to represent plants which were not native to the Dresden area, the two studied the exotic plant collections at [[Pillnitz Palace]]&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; and the [[Botanischer Garten der Technischen Universität Dresden|Dresden Botanical Garden]], and also grew some from seed sent from the United States.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; In 1892, Rudolf was sent on a trip to the [[Caribbean]] and the U.S. to study additional plants, making extensive drawings and notes.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; At this point the number of glass models sent annually to Harvard was approximately 120.&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GlassFlowers4HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A section of the Glass Flowers exhibit]]

Rudolf made a second trip to the U.S. in 1895. While he was overseas - and eleven years into the project - Leopold died.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; Rudolf continued to work alone, slowing down production so as to achieve higher levels of botanical perfection.&lt;ref name="popular science" /&gt; By the early twentieth century, he found that he was unable to buy glass of suitably high quality, and so started making his own.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; This was confirmed by Mary Lee Ware during her 1908 visit to Rudolf in a letter she wrote to the second director of the Botanical Museum, Professor [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]].&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; This letter appears to confirm the previous statement of Leopold's regarding his son; Miss Ware writes, ''"One change in the character of his work and, consequently in the time necessary to accomplish results since I was last here, is very noteworthy.At that time...he bought most of his glass and was just beginning to make some, and his finish was in paint. Now he himself makes a large part of the glass and all the enamels, which he powders to use as paint."''&lt;ref name="daston" /&gt; This missive to Professor Ames was published in January 9, 1961 by the [[Harvard University Herbaria]] - Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University Vol. 19, No. 6 - under the title "How Were The Glass Flowers Made?"&lt;ref name="leaflet" /&gt; Indeed, and in addition to funding and visiting, Mary took a fairly active role in the project's progress, going so far as to personally unpack each model&lt;ref name="harvard ware" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmog botanical" /&gt; and making arrangements for Rudolph's fieldwork in the U.S. and Jamaica&lt;ref name="harvard ware" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmog botanical" /&gt; – the purpose of such trips being to gather and study various plant specimens before returning to the old style Bohemian lamp-working table at which he (and Leopold) worked.

It should also be noted that, in 1911, Rudolf Blaschka married Frieda (whose maiden name is unknown) in a quiet wedding: "We had only a few guests but a great deal of people here had shown cordial interest...We took a four day wedding trip to visit the Ore mountains and the Zenkerhuette in Josefsthal a 200 year old glass factory where my great-grandfather was master about 130-150 years ago...we reached the remote place easily by the new railroad and we had right the last chance to see the interesting factory building. They are just going to pull it down and it will disappear". Furthermore, the couple hosted Mary L. Ware during the third of her three visits to Dresden, and they became very great friends.&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria"/&gt;

Rudolf continued making models for Harvard until 1938. By then aged 80, old and weary, he announced that he would retire.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt; Neither he nor his father had taken on an [[apprentice]], and Rudolf left no successor - he and Frieda Blaschka being childless.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; For Harvard alone, Leopold and Rudolf made approximately 4,400 models, 780 showing species at life-size, with others showing magnified details; under 75% are, as of May 21, 2016, on display at the HMNH, (the exhibit itself dedicated to [[Charles Eliot Ware|Dr. Charles Eliot Ware]], the father of Mary Ware and husband of Elizabeth Ware); the old exhibit contained 3000 models but this number was reduced for renovation purposes.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; Unlike the Glass sea creatures – "a profitable global mail-order business"&lt;ref name="harvard flowers" /&gt; – the Glass Flowers were commissioned solely for and are unique to Harvard.

==Legacy==
[[File:The grave of Leopold, Caroline, Rudolf and Frieda Blaschka.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The grave of Leopold, Caroline, Rudolf and Frieda Blaschka]]

Over the course of their collected lives Leopold and Rudolf crafted as many as ten thousand glass marine invertebrate models in addition to the 4,400 botanical ones that are the more famous Glass Flowers.&lt;ref&gt;"Back to Back Bay After an Absence of Ten Years". The New York Times. June 10, 1951. p. XX17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey N. Swinney &amp; (2008) Enchanted invertebrates: Blaschka models and other simulacra in National Museums Scotland, Historical Biology, 20:1, 39-50, DOI: 10.1080/08912960701677036 - https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912960701677036&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold and Rudolf and their spouses are buried together in the Hosterwitz cemetery in Dresden.

The Blaschka studio survived the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]] so, in 1993, the Corning Museum and Harvard jointly purchased the remaining Blaschka studio materials from Frieda Blaschka’s niece, Gertrud Pones.&lt;ref&gt;Drawing upon Nature: Studies for the Blaschkas’ Glass Models - http://www.cmog.org/publication/drawing-upon-nature-studies-blaschkas-glass-models-0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maestoso''''' ({{IPA-it|ma.eˈstoːzo}}) is an Italian [[musical term]] and is used to direct performers to play a certain [[passage (music)|passage]] of music in a stately, dignified and majestic fashion (sometimes march-like) or, it is used to describe music as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maestoso|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maestoso|work=Free Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Maestoso'' also is associated with the advent of [[Classical period (music)|Classicism]], [[Romantic music|Romanticism]], and the newer forms of [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neo-Classicism]] and [[Neoromanticism (music)|Neo-Romanticism]]. The interpretation of ''maestoso'' is varied by the conductor depending upon the overall style in which the piece is written. Used as more of an interpretive choice, this term is not always associated with a specific tempo or tempo range.

==Examples==
The term is commonly used in relatively slow pieces, but there are many examples, such as the first movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Flute Concerto No. 1 (Mozart)|Flute Concerto No. 1]], in which a faster tempo can be played in such ''maestoso''. Common examples of ''maestoso'' [[tempo]] include [[Elgar]]'s ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'', the first [[Movement (music)|movement]] of Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 21]], the first [[movement (music)|movement]] of both [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 6]] and [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]], as well as [[Chopin]]'s [[Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53|Polonaise in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 53]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/maestoso|title=Maestoso|work=Webster's Online Dictionary|publisher=Webster's|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Brahms)|First Piano Concerto]] is another example. Beethoven also indicated “Maestoso” in the first movement of his Piano Sonata Op.111 as an introduction of "Allegro". 

''Maestoso'' is also used very often for parts of pieces meant to sound large, triumphant and heroic, like the ''Olympic Fanfare and Theme'' by [[John Williams]]. The first movement of Chopin's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Chopin)|second concerto]] is marked ''Allegro maestoso''. The first movement of his Liszt's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Liszt)|First Piano Concerto]] is also marked ''Allegro maestoso''. Yet another example of this tempo marking is the opening of the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Steven Schwartz]].

[[Image:National Defense College of the Philippines in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City.png|thumb|right|National Defense College of the Philippines]]

The '''National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP)''' (Filipino: ''Dalubhasaan ng Tanggulang Pambansa ng Pilipinas'') is an educational, training, and research agency of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] located inside Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]].  It is responsible for providing continued and intensive studies of the diverse problems relating to national defense and security.  It is under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]].

==History==
The National Defense College of the Philippines was first conceived in 1957 when the military advisors of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) proposed the setting-up of a SEATO War College in the [[Philippines]].

There were legislative moves to pass a law creating the National Defense College of the Philippines. In the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Congressman Manuel A. Zosa filed the House Bill No. 1420 in 1970 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines and for other Purposes.” Also in the same year, then Congressman [[Ramon Bagatsing]] filed the House Bill No. 1447 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines, Providing an Academic Board, and for Other Purposes.” In the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], Senator Leonardo B. Perez filed the Senate Bill No. 597 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines and for other Purposes.” However, these legislative proposals did not reach third reading because [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dissolved the [[Philippine Congress]].

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] subsequently issued Presidential Decree No. 190 in 1973 to formally create the NDCP to "fulfill the need for an institution that will provide for continuing and intensive studies of the diversified problems related to national defense and security." NDCP was then placed under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Office of the Secretary of National Defense]] in 1974 by virtue of P.D. No. 452.

The Academic and Admission Boards were later established to oversee the academic program of the College. To carry out its teaching function, the NDCP draws top experts from the academe and senior officers with command and staff experiences from the major services of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

Lectures by foreign diplomats, technical experts and defense leaders also complement the instruction at the NDCP. The NDCP has managed to grow beyond its modest beginnings to train leaders in the military and civilian bureaucracy in strategic thinking.

On February 22, 1998, the College moved to its new and modern three-story building in the Academic Row, Camp [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]].

==Master in National Security Administration Program==
The '''Master in National Security Administration''' (MNSA) Program is the main academic program of the NDCP. It is a one-year, full-time master's degree course consisting of 39 units earned through various forms of classroom work, case studies, regional security and development studies and academic enhancement travels.

The MNSA curriculum focuses on the various dimensions of [[national security]] management:
# socio-cultural dimension
# political-legal dimension
# economic dimension
# techno-scientific dimension
# environmental dimension
# military dimension

The MNSA is open to military officers, government officials and private sector leaders. Students write a [[national security]]-oriented thesis. Civilian graduates are commissioned [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s or [[Commander]]s in the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] Reserve Force.

==Strategic Research and Special Studies==
===Institute for National Security Studies===
The '''Institute for National Security Studies (INSS)''' administers the research program of the NDCP. It embodies the College's effort to be the center of excellence in strategic thinking on [[national security]] matters in the [[Philippines]] and in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

===Crisis Management Institute===
The '''Crisis Management Institute (CMI)''', formerly the ''Emergency Management Institute of the Philippines (EMIP)'', is envisioned to be the country's center for education, training, and research on [[crisis management]], [[terrorism]], and other [[transnational crime]]s, and as the premier training resource for technical cooperation in emergency management in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

===Defense Management Institute===
The '''Defense Management Institute (DMI)''', formerly the ''Institute for Extramural and Continuing Studies (IECS)'', is envisioned to be the key training institution on certificate and diploma courses on National Security Administration and to be a recognized training institution in the [[Asia-Pacific]].

'''New Suburbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which intends to improve on existing [[Suburb|suburban]] or [[exurban]] designs.&lt;ref name="The New Suburbanism: A Realist's Guide to the American Future"&gt;[http://www.southbaycities.org/files/12.05%20Kotkin%20New%20Suburbanism%20Report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23290105?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101999752763|title=The Emerging 'Silicon Savanna': From Old Urbanism to New Suburbanism|author=STEPHEN MARSHALL|date=1978|volume=32|pages=267–280|publisher=Alexandrine Press|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barternews.com/new_suburbanism_growing_in_southern_california.htm |title=New Suburbanism Growing In Southern California |publisher=Barternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to [[Personalization|customization]], new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city-center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Paul and Marc Tsurumaki, David J. Lewis.|date=2003|title=New Suburbanism|url=http://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1384&amp;context=oz|journal=Oz|volume=25|pages=34–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suburban sprawl]] is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities. Suburban sprawl continues to grow as over 70% of Americans choose to live in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fannie-Mae-Foundation. ''Downtown housing as an urban redevelopment tool: hope or hype (panel discussion).'' Housing Policy Debate, 10 (1997), pp. 477–505. Retrieved: 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Planners are currently seeking to make the suburbs more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and New Suburbanism offers a solution. This planning approach seeks to redesign suburban communities by making them more-dense, equitable, and environmentally sustainable while still keeping housing and design preferences of the consumer in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkninson-Palombo|first=Carol|date=2010|title=New housing construction in Phoenix: Evidence of "new suburbanism"?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275109001073|journal=Cities|volume=27|pages=77–86|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to New Urbanism==
[[New Urbanism]] is a style of planning a new neighborhood that focuses on designing aspects that create more [[community engagement]], whereas New Suburbanism is the improving of an existing suburban neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

New urbanism, though a small movement, is more successful than New Suburbanism, as NS only has 1 location and NU has hundreds.

A '''normal school''' is the historical term for an institution created to train high school graduates to be teachers by educating them in the norms of [[pedagogy]] and [[curriculum]]. Most such schools, where they still exist, are now denominated "teacher-training colleges" or "teachers' colleges" and may be organized as part of a comprehensive university. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', normal schools in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] trained teachers for [[Primary education|primary schools]], while in continental [[Europe]], the equivalent colleges educated teachers for primary, [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle|St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]], founder of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]], founded what is generally considered the first normal school, the ''École Normale'', in [[Reims]], [[Champagne]], [[France]]. The term "normal" herein refers to the goal of these institutions to instill and reinforce particular ''norms'' within students. "Norms" included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum.

Educating teachers was of great importance in the newly industrialized European economies and their need for a reliable, reproducible and uniform work force. The process of instating such norms within students depended upon the creation of the first uniform, formalized national educational curriculum. Thus, normal schools, as the teacher training schools, were tasked with both developing this new curriculum and developing the techniques through which teachers would instill these ideas, behaviors and values in the minds of their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=H.A.|date=|title=The Normal-School Curriculum|url=|journal=The Elementary School Journal|volume=20|pages=276–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public normal school in the United States was founded in [[Concord, Vermont]], by [[Samuel Read Hall]] in 1823 to train teachers. In 1839, another normal school was established in the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]]; it evolved into [[Framingham State University]]. The first modern teacher training school in China was established by Qing educator [[Sheng Xuanhuai|Sheng Xuanghuai]] in 1895 as the normal school of the Nanyang Public School (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]) in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uta.fi/cerec/educationandresearch/ChinaEduLecture/Teacher%20Education%20in%20China.pdf|title=Teacher Education in China :

Many comprehensive [[Public university|public or state-supported universities]], such as the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the United States and [[Beijing Normal University]] in China, were established and operated as normal schools before expanding their faculties and organizing as research universities. Some of these universities, particularly in Asia, retain the word "Normal" in their name to recognize their historical purpose. In Canada, most normal schools were eventually assimilated into a university as its faculty of education, offering a one or two-year [[Bachelor of Education]] degree. Such a degree requires at least three, but usually four, years of prior undergraduate study.

==Etymology==

The term "normal school" originated in the early 16th century from the French ''école normale''.&lt;ref name="Edwards1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Theory, History, and Practice of Education: Fin de siècle and a new beginning |journal=McGill Journal of Education |volume=26 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1991 |url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewFile/7991/5919 |author=Reginald Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French concept of an "école normale" was to provide a model school with model classrooms to teach model teaching practices to its student teachers. The children being taught, their teachers, and the teachers of the teachers were often together in the same building.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although a [[laboratory school]], it was the official school for the children—primary or secondary.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== History and modern teacher education ==

=== Europe ===

===== Finland =====
In Finland, normal schools are under national university administration, whereas most schools are administered by the local [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]]. Teacher aspirants do most of their compulsory trainee period in normal schools and teach while being supervised by a senior teacher.

===== France =====
In France, a two-tier system developed since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]: primary school teachers were educated at [[département]]al ''écoles normales'', high school teachers at the [[École normale supérieure|Écoles normales supérieures]]. Nowadays all teachers are educated in {{illm|École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation|fr}} (Graduate School of Teaching and Education). The [[Écoles Normales Supérieures]] in France and the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] in Italy no longer specialize in teacher training.

===== United Kingdom =====
In the United Kingdom, teacher training colleges were once separate institutions, and many such colleges adopted the title "College of Higher Education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/Memories_of_Caerleon_-_final.pdf|title=Memories of Caerleon|publisher=[[University of South Wales]]|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A restructuring of higher education in the UK during the 1980s resulted in many of these adopting the status of "university". The [[University of Chester]] traces its roots back to 1839 as the earliest training college in the United Kingdom. Others were established by religious institutions and were single-sex until [[World War II]]. Since then, they have either become multi-discipline universities in their own right (e.g. University of Chester, [[St Mary's University, Twickenham]], [[Edge Hill University]]) or merged with another university to become its faculty of education (e.g. [[Moray House]]).

In [[Wales]], there were two colleges which included the word 'Normal' in their name: the first being 'The Normal College, Swansea' where the eminent mathematician [[John Viriamu Jones]] was educated and the second was [[Bangor Normal College|The Normal College, Bangor]] (founded 1858), which survived until 1996, when it became part of [[University of Wales Bangor]]. The latter was one of the last institutions in the UK to retain the word "Normal" in its name.

===== Lithuania =====
In Lithuania, [[Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences]] (LEU), former Vilnius Pedagogical University (VPU) is the main teachers' training institution, established in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leu.lt|title=Pradžia - Lietuvos edukologijos universitetas|first=Fresh|last=Media|date=|website=www.leu.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mainland China ====
In [[Mainland China]], the "normal school" terminology is still preserved in the official English names of former normal schools established in the late 19th and early 20th century, with [[Beijing Normal University]] being the oldest such school to have kept the term. The Chinese term ''normal university'' ({{zh|c=师范大学|p=shīfàn dàxué}}, abbreviated 师大; ''shīdà'') refers to a modern comprehensive university established as a normal school in the early twentieth century. These "normal universities" are usually controlled by the national or provincial government. In 1895, Qing banking tycoon and educator [[Sheng Xuanhuai|Sheng Xuanghuai]] gained approval from the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to establish the Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, China.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This comprehensive institution included the first normal school on the Chinese mainland. Since 1949, many former normal schools in China have developed into comprehensive research universities. As of 2012, [[East China Normal University]] and [[Beijing Normal University]], both members of the national government's [[Project 985]] program to build world-class universities, have been ranked the top two among the mainland Chinese universities that originated as normal schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2011-12/08/content_24105530_9.htm|title=Top 10 normal universities (teachers' colleges) in China - China.org.cn|first=|last=徐林|date=|website=www.china.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan ====
In [[Taiwan]], three universities served as national normal universities historically. Located in [[National Taiwan Normal University|Taipei]], [[National Changhua University of Education|Changhua]], and [[National Kaohsiung Normal University|Kaohsiung]], the schools prepared [[secondary school]] teachers; these schools' missions have expanded since to make them ''de facto'' [[liberal arts]] universities. Ten Taiwanese teachers' colleges ({{zh|c=師範學院|p=shīfàn xuéyuàn}}, abbreviated 師院; shīyuàn, "normal colleges") originated as normal schools [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|established by the Japanese]]. After the [[Retrocession Day|end of World War 2]] these were reorganized as provincial normal schools by the Kuomintang and then as provincial teachers' colleges. With the arrival of pluralistic [[democracy]] in the early 1990s these colleges came under national control, and by the mid-2000s (decade) all had been renamed as "universities of education" (教育大學) or simply "universities" to signify their more comprehensive missions.

==== Philippines ====
In [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], one can find the oldest normal school for girls in the Far East, the [[Universidad de Santa Isabel]]. It is a sectarian school run by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]].  The first secular normal school was founded in 1901 by the [[Thomasites]], the Philippine Normal School.  It was converted into a college in 1949 and was elevated to its present university status in 1992 as the [[Philippine Normal University]].  In 2009, it was named National Center of Excellence for Teacher Education by virtue of Republic Act 9647. In [[Iloilo City]], the [[West Visayas State University]] was originally established as a normal school in 1902; in 1994, it was recognized by the Philippines government as a Center for Teaching Excellence.

==== Malaysia ====
In [[Malaysia]], the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] runs a total of 27 Institutes of Teacher Education (ITEs), which were formerly known as Teacher Training Colleges. These ITEs function primarily to educated both undergraduate and postgraduate teacher trainees. The ministry bureau responsible for overseeing them is the [[Teacher Education Division]]. The ITEs also run in-service teacher training and continuous professional development among qualified teachers.

=== Oceania ===

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, the term ''normal school'' can refer to a primary or intermediate school used for teacher training, such as the [[Epsom Normal Primary School]] (in Auckland), [[Kelburn Normal School]], [[Palmerston North Intermediate Normal School]], [[Papakura Normal School]] or [[Tahuna Normal Intermediate School]]. They were associated with a teachers' training college, such as the [[Auckland Teachers' Training College]], which became colleges of education that trained secondary as well as primary and intermediate school teachers.

===North America===

====Jamaica====
[[Mico University College]] is the oldest teacher training institute in the [[English-speaking]] world outside of Europe.  It was founded under [[Lady Mico Charity]] in 1834 by [[Fowell Buxton|Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton]] "to afford the benefit of education and training to the black and coloured population."  Today, it offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in a variety of education and liberal arts disciplines.

===United States===

====1823 - Columbian School in Concord, Vermont====

In 1823, Reverend [[Samuel Read Hall]] founded the first normal school in the United States, the Columbian School in [[Concord, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html Samuel Read Hall Biography at the Old Stone House Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405231650/http://www.oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html |date=2010-04-05 }}, Retrieved on 2009-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="melrosemirror.media.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920192639/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-09-20|title=An early Yankee Educator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by similar academies in [[Prussia]] and elsewhere in Europe, American normal schools were intended to improve the quality of the burgeoning [[common school]] system by producing more qualified teachers. Hall also founded the first normal schools in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="melrosemirror.media.mit.edu"/&gt;  The school was renamed Concord Academy before closing after seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/crs/?Page=resources/profiles/Concord/human.htm|title=Center for Rural Studies : University of Vermont|first=University of|last=Vermont|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1839 - Framingham State University, Lexington, Massachusetts====

[[Image:Simon W Robinson Masonic Lodge, Lexington MA.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Site of the first public normal school&lt;br&gt;in the United States,&lt;br&gt;in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Sixteen years after Columbian School had been founded in Vermont, the first state-funded normal school was founded in the neighboring state of [[Massachusetts]], thanks largely to the efforts of [[education reform]]ers such as [[Horace Mann]] and [[James G. Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/normal.html Normal Schools - History of American Education Web Project], Retrieved on 2007-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its founding that school moved from its original site of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] to [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]]. Today, [[Framingham State University]] is recognized as the oldest, continuously operated public normal school in the United States. [[Anna Brackett]] attended this University and was a teacher - later to become the first woman principal of a teacher's college.{{sfn|Kane|1997|p=199, item #3264 ''The first teacher training school principal who was a woman was Anna Callender Brackett, who on January 5, 1863, took charge of the St.Louis Normal School, St. Louis, MO''}}{{sfn|Rogers|2005|p=73 ''Anna Brackett was the first woman in the US to be appointed principal of a secondary school, the St. Louis Normal School in 1863'' }}

====1849 - State Normal School, New Britain, Connecticut====

The State Normal School in New Britain was founded in 1849. It was the first training school for teachers in the state of Connecticut. The school is now [[Central Connecticut State University]].

====1853 - Michigan State Normal School====

The first normal school west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the United States was the Michigan State Normal School, now [[Eastern Michigan University]]. It was created by legislative action in 1849 and opened in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], in 1853.&lt;ref name='EMU'&gt;

====1854 - Rhode Island State Normal School====

When the college was established in 1854 as the Rhode Island State Normal School, its goal was to provide teacher preparation to young people from Rhode Island. With the dedication of a new building in 1898, the institution began a period of steady growth, evolving first into a teachers' college, the Rhode Island College of Education. In the 1958-59 academic year the college moved to its current Mount Pleasant campus, and in 1959 was renamed [[Rhode Island College]] to reflect its new purpose as a comprehensive institution of higher education. With an enrollment predominantly from Rhode Island and nearby Massachusetts and Connecticut, the institution historically has served as a "College of Opportunity" for first-generation college students.

====1854 -  Salem Normal School, Salem, Massachusetts ====

Salem Normal School, now [[Salem State University]], was founded in 1854 as the fourth Normal School in [[Massachusetts]]. In 1853, the General Court authorized the founding of a normal school in Essex County. Proposals were received from Salem, Chelsea, Groveland, and North Andover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitman|first1=J. Asbury|title=The Salem Normal School: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=February 1930|volume= 30|issue=6|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] was selected due to many factors including the city's historical and commercial significance and need for local teacher education.

Prior to the founding of the normal school, Salem women had few opportunities to receive teacher training and the Salem school system was replete with funding, attendance, and teacher compensation problems. It was assumed that by training women as teachers, they could be hired at a lower salary than male teachers, thus alleviating the city's public school budget and teacher compensation challenges.

The original location was at the corner of Broad and Summer Streets, with the building's dedication held on September 14, 1854. Richard Edwards, a graduate of Bridgewater Normal School (now [[Bridgewater State University]]), was the first president of Salem Normal School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloney|first=Joan|title=Salem Normal School 1854-1905: A Tradition of Excellence|year=1990|publisher=Tapestry Press|location=Acton, MA|isbn=0-924234-31-8|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Early normal schools in [[Latin America]] include several in Mexico, such as the ''Escuela Normal de Enseñanza Mutua de Oaxaca'' (1824), the ''Escuela Normal Mixta de San Luis Potosí'' (1849), the Normal de Guadalajara (1881), and the ''Escuela Normal para Profesores de Instrucción Primaria'' (1887). The Mexican normal school system was nationalized and reorganized by the ''[[Secretariat of Public Education|Secretaría de Educación Pública]]'' (Secretariat of Public Education) under [[José Vasconcelos]] in 1921.

Perhaps the oldest continually operating normal school in Latin America is the Escuela Normal Superior José Abelardo Núñez, founded in [[Santiago, Chile]], in 1842 as the Escuela de Preceptores de Santiago under the direction of the emininent [[Argentina|Argentine]] educator, writer, and politician [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. The first normal school in the [[Dominican Republic]] was founded in 1875 by [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] educator and activist [[Eugenio María de Hostos]].

In Argentina, normal schools were founded starting in 1852, and still exist today and carry that name. Teachers' training is considered higher education and requires a high school diploma, but normal schools have the particularity of granting five year teacher degrees for primary school or four year degrees for kindergarten, while at the same time hosting secondary, primary school students, and kindergarten and pre-school. Teachers-to-be do intense practical training in the schools annexed to the higher education section. This is the main difference with other teachers' training institutions called Instituto de Formación Docente and with universities that grant teaching degrees.

Other Latin American nations have long traditions of normal schools. In Panama, the Escuela Normal Juan Demóstenes Arosemena was founded in [[Santiago de Veraguas]], [[Panama]] in 1938. In [[Colombia]], normal schools were primarily associated with women's religious schools although in modern times have admitted men, thus forming ''escuelas normales mixtas'' (mixed normal schools). In [[Paraguay]], they are known as Instituto de Formación Docente.

The term '''Norman architecture''' is used to categorise styles of [[Romanesque architecture]] developed by the [[Normans]] in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries. In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture.  The Normans introduced large numbers of [[castle]]s and [[fortification]]s  including Norman [[keep]]s, and at the same time [[monastery|monasteries]], [[abbey]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[cathedral]]s, in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded [[arch]]es (particularly over windows and doorways) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style.

==Origins==
These [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] styles originated in [[Normandy]] and became widespread in north western [[Europe]], particularly in [[England]], which contributed considerable development and has the largest number of surviving examples. At about the same time [[Hauteville family|a Norman dynasty]] ruled in [[Sicily]], producing a distinctive variation incorporating [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Saracen]] influences which is also known as Norman architecture, or alternatively as Sicilian Romanesque. Ancient Rome's invention of the arch is the basis of all Norman architecture.

The term may have originated with eighteenth-century [[antiquarian]]s, but its usage in a sequence of styles has been attributed to [[Thomas Rickman]] in his 1817 work ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' which used the labels "Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular". The more inclusive term ''romanesque'' was used of the [[Romance languages]] in English by 1715,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Romanesque": in French a letter of 1818 by [[Charles-Alexis-Adrien Duhérissier de Gerville]] seems to be the first&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries from 1819.&lt;ref&gt;OED same entry; in French by Gerville's friend [[Arcisse de Caumont]] in his ''Essaie sur l'architecture du moyen âge, particulièrement en Normandie,'' 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Edward the Confessor]] built [[Westminster Abbey]] in Romanesque style (now all replaced by later rebuildings) just before the Conquest, which is still believed to be the earliest major Romanesque building in England, no significant remaining Romanesque architecture in Britain can clearly be shown to predate the Conquest, although historians believe that many surviving "Norman" elements in buildings, nearly all churches, may well in fact be Anglo-Saxon.

The Norman arch is a defining point of Norman architecture. Grand [[arch]]ways are designed to evoke feelings of [[awe]] and are very commonly seen as the entrance to large [[religious]] buildings such as [[cathedral]]s.

==Normandy==
[[Viking]] invaders arrived at the mouth of the [[river Seine]] in 911, at a time when [[Franks]] were fighting on horseback and Frankish lords were building castles. Over the next century the population of the territory ceded to the Vikings, now called [[Normans]], adopted these customs as well as Christianity and the ''[[langue d'oïl]]''. Norman barons built timber castles on earthen mounds, beginning the development of [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and great stone churches in the Romanesque style of the Franks. By 950, they were building stone [[keep]]s. The Normans were among the most travelled peoples of Europe, exposing them to a wide variety of cultural influences which became incorporated in their art and architecture.  They elaborated on the early Christian basilica plan. Originally longitudinal with side aisles and an apse they began to add in towers, as at the Church of Saint-Étienne]] at Caen, in 1067. This would eventually form a model for the larger English [[cathedral]]s some 20 years later.

==England==

[[File:Norman arch.jpg|thumb |A Norman arch with zig-zag mouldings above the church doorway at [[Guiting Power]], [[Gloucestershire]]]]
In [[England]], Norman nobles and bishops had influence before the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and Norman influences affected late [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]]. [[Edward the Confessor]] was brought up in Normandy and in 1042 brought masons to work on the first Romanesque building in England, [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1051 he brought in Norman [[knight]]s who built "motte" castles as a defence against the [[Wales|Welsh]]. Following the invasion, Normans rapidly constructed [[motte-and-bailey]] castles along with  [[Church (building)|churches]], [[abbey]]s, and more elaborate [[fortification]]s such as Norman stone [[keep]]s.

The buildings show massive proportions in simple geometries using small bands of [[sculpture]]. Paying attention to the concentrated spaces of [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s and round doorways as well as the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] under an arch. The "Norman arch" is the rounded, often with mouldings carved or incised onto it for decoration. [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron patterns]], frequently termed "zig-zag [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]]", were a frequent signature of the Normans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Edward |title=ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC |journal=The Archaeological Review |date=December 1888 |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=237-251 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44245200 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]]es often had deep [[chancel]]s and a square [[crossing tower]] which has remained a feature of English [[ecclesiastical architecture]]. Hundreds of [[parish]] churches were built and the great English [[cathedral]]s were founded from 1083.

After a fire damaged [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174 Norman masons introduced the new [[Gothic architecture]]. Around 1191 [[Wells Cathedral]] and [[Lincoln Cathedral]] brought in the English Gothic style, and Norman became increasingly a modest style of provincial building.

==Scotland==
[[Scotland]] also came under early Norman influence with Norman nobles at the court of King [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] around 1050. His successor [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Máel Coluim III]] overthrew him with English and Norman assistance, and his queen, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], encouraged the church. The [[Benedictine]] order founded a monastery at [[Dunfermline]]. Her sixth and youngest son, who became [[David I of Scotland|King David]], built [[St. Margaret's Chapel]] at the start of the 12th century.

==Ireland==
The Normans first landed in Ireland in 1169. Within five years earthwork castles were springing up, and in a further five, work was beginning on some of the earliest of the great stone castles. For example, [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] built a [[Motte-and-bailey]] castle on the site of the present day [[Trim Castle]], [[County Meath]], which was attacked and burned in 1173 by the Irish king [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]]. De Lacy, however, then constructed a stone castle in its place, which enclosed over three acres within its walls, and this could not be burned down by the Irish. The years between 1177 and 1310 saw the construction of some of the greatest of the Norman castles in Ireland. The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and among other buildings they constructed were [[Swords Castle]] in [[Fingal]] (North County Dublin), [[Dublin Castle]] and [[Carrickfergus Castle]] in [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Castles in Ireland Feudal Power in a Gaelic World. by Tom McNeill. (London, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-415-22853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

===Mezzogiorno===
The Normans began constructing castles, their trademark architectural piece, in Italy from an early date. [[William Iron Arm]] built one at an unidentified location (Stridula) in [[Calabria]] in 1045. After the death of [[Robert Guiscard]] in 1085, the [[Mezzogiorno]] (peninsular southern Italy) experienced a series of civil wars and fell under the control of increasingly weaker princes. Revolts characterised the region until well into the twelfth century and minor lords sought to resist ducal or royal power from within their own castles. In the [[Molise]], the Normans embarked on their most extensive castle-building programme and introduced the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' technique to Italy. Their clever use of the local stone artisans, together with the vast riches amassed from their enslaved population, made such tremendous feats possible. Some as majestic as those of the ancient Roman structures they tried to emulate.

Besides the [[encastellation]] of the countryside, the Normans erected several religious buildings which still survive. They edified the shrine at [[Monte Sant'Angelo]] and built a [[mausoleum]] to the [[Hauteville family]] at [[Venosa]]. They also built many new Latin monasteries, including the famous foundation of {{ill|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|lt=Sant'Eufemia|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlante.beniculturalicalabria.it/schede.php?id=178 |title=Abbazia Benedettina di Sant’ Eufemia |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of great importance are the portal of the [[Shrine of Mary Queen of Anglona]] and the ambulatory and radiating chapels of the [[Aversa Cathedral]]. In [[Salerno]], however, remember Fruscione Palace.

Here is a list of Norman architecture in the Mezzogiorno : 
* Castle of Circello. 
* Castle Monforte (Campobasso).

===Sicily===
{{further|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture}}

[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Cefalu]]]]
[[Sicily]]'s Norman period lasted from circa 1070 until about 1200.  The architecture was decorated in [[gilding|gild]]ed mosaics such as that at the cathedral at [[Monreale]].  The Palatine Chapel in [[Palermo]] built in 1130 is perhaps the strongest example of this. The interior of the [[dome]], (itself a Byzantine feature), is decorated in a [[mosaic]] depicting Christ Pantocrator accompanied by his [[angel]]s.

During Sicily's later Norman era early Gothic influences can be detected such as those in the [[Messina Cathedral|cathedral]] at Messina consecrated in 1197.  However, here the high Gothic [[campanile]] is of a later date and should not be confused with the early Gothic built during the Norman period; which featured pointed arches and windows rather than the [[flying buttress]]es and [[pinnacle]]s later to manifest themselves in the Gothic era.

===Malta===
After its Norman conquest in 1091, Malta saw the construction of several Norman pieces of architecture. Many have been demolished and rebuilt over the years (especially after the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]] which destroyed many old Norman buildings), however some fortresses and houses still exist in [[Mdina]] and [[Vittoriosa]].

==Transitional style==
As [[stone mason|master mason]]s developed the style and experimented with ways of overcoming the geometric difficulties of [[groin vault]]ed ceilings, they introduced features such as the pointed arch that were later characterised as being [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. Architectural historians and scholars consider that a style must be assessed as an integral whole rather than an aggregate of features, and while some include these developments within the Norman or Romanesque styles, others describe them as transitional or "Norman–Gothic Transitional". A few websites use the term "Norman Gothic", but it is unclear whether they refer to the transitional style or to the Norman style as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/Gothic-architecture.htm |title=Gothic Architecture in England |publisher=Britainexpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racine.ra.it/ungaretti/gothic/norman_gothic.htm |title=Norman Gothic |publisher=Racine.ra.it |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Norman==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Neo-Norman architecture is a type of [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] based on Norman Romanesque architecture. There is sometimes confusion, especially in North America, between this style and revivalist versions of vernacular or later [[architecture of Normandy]], such as the "Norman farmhouse style" popular for larger houses.

Romanesque Revival versions focus on the arch and capitals, and decorated doorways.  There are two examples in Manchester: the former Stock Exchange building and a synagogue in [[Fallowfield]].

[[File:Oib outside.jpg|thumb|Orient-Institut Beirut]]

The '''Orient-Institut Beirut''' (OIB) ({{lang-ar|المعهد الألماني للأبحاث الشرقية}}) is one of ten German Humanities Institutes Abroad which belong to the [[Max Weber Foundation]]. The OIB was established in 1961 by the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] (German Oriental Society) and is part of the Max Weber Foundation since 2003. The OIB supports and promotes independent research on the historical and contemporary Middle East and the Arab world in cooperation with researchers and academic institutions throughout the region.

== History ==
The Orient-Institut Beirut was founded by the German Oriental Society in 1961. It was financed by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology, the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]] and the [[VolkswagenStiftung]]. Since 2003 the Orient-Institut Beirut belongs to the Max Weber Foundation – German Humanities Institutes Abroad. In 2009 the [[Orient-Institut Istanbul]] (OI Istanbul) – which had been a branch of the Beirut institute for 20 years – became an independent institution inside the Max Weber Foundation. The OIB, which conducts and supports research on historical and contemporary issues related to Lebanon and the Arab world, has increased his cooperation with academic partners in Egypt since 2010.

== Academic Profile and Tasks ==
The OIB is an interdisciplinary research institute. The study of social, religious, and intellectual history, as well as the study of literature, language and politics figures among the various projects undertaken at the institute. It is part of the OIB's mission to support young academic researchers. The Orient-Institut Beirut employs research associates and supports PhD students, post-docs, research projects, affiliated researchers, and scholars working on the Middle East. The OIB cooperates with numerous academic institutions and organizes academic events (lectures, symposia, and congresses)on a wide variety of issues related to the [[MENA]] region.

== Library ==
The library of the OIB is open for public use and offers 130.000 volumes and 1.700 periodicals. Its collection includes studies on religion, philosophy, and law as well as on literature, history and contemporary themes related to the Middle East. Material is gathered in Western languages, in Arabic and occasionally in Persian and Turkish. All this is supplemented by academic literature from various related disciplines, including political science, social anthropology and sociology. One of the richest resources of the OIB is its collections of periodicals covering politics, religion, and culture as well as several literary magazines published in the Middle East.

== Publication series ==
The OIB publishes two series of publications and one online-publication.
* In the series '''Bibliotheca Islamica''' ({{lang-ar|النشرات الإسلامية}}) manuscripts dating back from the 11th century onwards are edited as books.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BI%20Liste%20dt.22.9.11_aktuell.pdf ''Bibliotheca Islamica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BI%20Liste%20ar.7.9.11_aktuell.pdf ''النشرات الإسلامية''] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critical editions include Arabic, Persian and Turkish texts - on topics ranging from history, prosopography, literature and theology to Sufism. 
* In the series '''Beiruter Texte und Studien''' (Beirut Texts and Studies) &lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BTS-Liste%20Feb_2012.pdf ''Beiruter Texte und Studien'']&lt;/ref&gt; academic studies, monographs, and conference proceedings are published in German, English, Arabic and French.
* In cooperation with the Orient-Institut Istanbul, the OIB publishes the online series '''Orient-Institut Studies''' on perspectivia.net.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.perspectivia.net/content/publikationen/orient-institut-studies/1-2012/ ''Orient-Institut Studies'']&lt;/ref&gt; This series is meant to combine regional and trans-regional perspectives in Middle Eastern and Euro-Asian Studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29701">'''Overurbanization''' is a thesis originally developed by scholars of [[demography]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in the 20th century to describe cities whose rate of [[urbanization]] outpaces their industrial growth and economic development. Overurbanized countries are characterized by an inability to provide for their populations in terms of employment and resources.&lt;ref  name=Firebaugh&gt;Firebaugh, Glenn. “Structural Determinants of Urbanization in Asia and Latin America, 1950- 1970.” American Sociological Review 44, no. 2 (April 1, 1979): 199–215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amin&gt;Amin, Galal A.

Schafer. “Urbanization and Development: The Emergence of International Nongovernmental Organizations Amid Declining States.” Sociological Perspectives 43, no. 1 (April 1, 2000): 97–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is intentionally comparative and has been used to differentiate between developed and developing countries.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. “Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas.” Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Several causes have been suggested, but the most common is rural-push and urban-pull factors in addition to [[population growth]].&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;

==Definition==
The concept of overurbanization first emerged in the mid-20th century to describe cities whose rate of [[industrialization]] was growing more slowly than their rate of urbanization.&lt;ref name=Amin/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;Hauser, Philip M., ed. “[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0005/000545/054505eo.pdf Urbanization in Asia and the Far East].” In ''Proceedings of the Joint UN/Unesco Seminar (in Cooperation with the International Labour Office) on Urbanization in the ECAFE Region, Bangkok, 8–18 August 1956.'' Calcutta: Unesco Research Center, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani&gt;Sovani, N. V. “The Analysis of ‘Over-Urbanization.’” ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 12, no. 2 (January 1, 1964): 113–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to sociologist Josef Gugler, the concept was "widely accepted in the 1950s and into the 1960s" and was split into two approaches, a diachronic and a synchronic approach.&lt;ref name=Gugler&gt;Gugler, Josef. “Overurbanization Reconsidered.” ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 31, no. 1 (October 1, 1982): 173–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Laumas&gt;Laumas, Prem S., and Martin Williams. “Urbanization and Economic Development.” ''Eastern Economic Journal'' 10, no. 3 (July 1, 1984): 325–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  The synchronic approach, the main one taken in the 1950s, was proposed by sociologists [[Kingsley Davis]] and Hilda Golden who defined whether a country was overurbanized based on  how its relationship between industrialization and urbanization compared to that of other countries during the same time period.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt; Specifically, countries considered part of the [[Third World]] were compared to countries deemed part of the [[First World]].&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt; Davis and Golden used data on "the percentage of economically active males not engaged in agriculture and the percentage of the population in cities of 100,000 or above in a large number of the countries in the world," in order to define the normal relationship between [[industrialization]] and urbanization.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; They then determine that countries whose rate of urbanization is significantly higher than normal in relation to their rate of industrialization are "overurbanized."&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; The authors calculate an "expected" level of urbanization based on the rates of urbanization of other countries of the world at similar levels of industrialization (measured by percentage of males not engaged in agriculture).&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; A few countries in particular that Davis and Golden measured as having higher levels of urbanization than expected were [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamerschen&gt;Kamerschen, David R. “Further Analysis of Overurbanization.” ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 17, no. 2 (January 1, 1969): 235–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Davis and Golden did not see overurbanization as a necessarily negative phenomenon, but rather a statistical reality that could have its challenges but would ultimately be self-correcting as an appropriate balance was found between levels of urbanization and industrialization.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Scholars on overurbanization agree that N.V. Sovani was one of the first to discount Davis and Golden's argument, as he found that the connection between urbanization and industrialization was more significant in underdeveloped countries than developed ones, suggesting that Davis and Golden's measure of a "normal" relationship between urbanization and industrialization was not valid.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt;

The definition offered by the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]] in 1956 took a different approach to measuring overurbanization: the diachronic approach.  A 1956 UNESCO report measured overurbanization historically, emphasizing that "at comparable levels of urbanization developed countries of today had a correspondingly greater proportion of their labour force engaged in non-agricultural occupations" than underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Authors on overurbanization give the examples of France, the United States, Germany, and Canada as developed and often mention the continents of Asia and Africa as well as the region of Latin America as underdeveloped.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shandra&gt;Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. “Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis.” Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (September 1, 2003): 309–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; This historical approach was applied to Asia in the report, which argued that because a smaller percentage of the labor force was engaged in non-agricultural activities than certain Western developed countries had at similar levels of urbanization, Asia was overurbanized.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; However, this method has been criticized by scholars who argue that it supports an [[ethnocentric]] idea that all countries follow the same path of development. Furthermore, economist N.V. Sovani argued that the evidence offered is not consistent with the development trajectories of developed countries, pointing out specific examples of developed countries such as Switzerland where high levels of industrialization did not correspond with high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; Sociologists [[John D. Kasarda]] and Edward Crenshaw pointed out that it was not so much the rate of urbanization of developing countries that was greater, but the absolute numbers of people migrating.&lt;ref name=Kasarda&gt;Kasarda, John D., and Edward M. Crenshaw. “Third World Urbanization: Dimensions, Theories, and Determinants.” Annual Review of Sociology 17 (January 1, 1991): 467–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars reference N.V. Sovani as a researcher who questioned whether to accept the 1950s definition of overurbanization. His debunking of the formerly accepted definitions of overurbanization encouraged further scholarly analysis and attempts to redefine the term.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=graves&gt;Graves, Philip E., and Robert L. Sexton. “Overurbanization and Its Relation to Economic Growth for Less Developed Countries.” ''Economy Forum'' 8, no. 1 (July 1979): 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Sovani suggested that claims of overurbanization in underdeveloped countries stemmed from the perception that rapid urbanization had negative consequences.&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; However, he claimed that there still lacked evidence for the idea that rapid urbanization actually made areas worse off.&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; Economist David R. Kamerschen found that there was little statistical evidence to support that "rapid urbanization in underdeveloped countries hampers economic growth," suggesting that the phenomenon of overurbanization is questionable.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;

Following Sovani's work, several scholars offered alternative definitions, many of which included not just the relationship between population growth and their means of employment but also the ability of the urban area to provide public services, reflecting that [[economic development]] lagged behind population growth in a multitude of ways.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=graves/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dyckman&gt;Dyckman, John W. “Some Conditions of Civic Order in an Urbanized World.” ''Daedalus'' 95, no. 3 (July 1, 1966): 797–812.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars also increasingly embraced a negative connotation for the term.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laumas/&gt;&lt;ref name=graves/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dyckman/&gt; Urban planner John Dyckman suggested that inability to accommodate the expectations of migrants to the city made overurbanization a threat to social order.&lt;ref name=Dyckman/&gt; Economists Philip Graves and Robert Sexton  argue that the definition of overurbanization must "involve the presence of negative net external effects for the city size in question," suggesting that as long as "positive external social benefits" from rapid urbanization dominate negative externalities, overurbanization is not at play.&lt;ref name=graves/&gt; Gugler defined overurbanization by two factors: that migration to cities led to a "less than optimal allocation of labor between the rural and urban sectors" and that migration to cities "increases the costs of providing for a country's growing population."&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt; Sociologist [[Glenn Firebaugh]] disagreed, arguing that if overurbanization is caused by overpopulation, that overpopulation of rural areas could be worse than overpopulation of urban areas.&lt;ref name=Firebaugh/&gt;

From its origins, the term has been used to differentiate between countries that are considered developed and underdeveloped. Davis and Golden considered a country to be underdeveloped if over half its economically active males were employed in agriculture.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; The UNESCO report frequently used the terms "developed" and "Western" in conjunction.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Gugler and others use the terms "third world" and "first world" in their discussion.&lt;ref name=Firebaugh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kentor&gt;Kentor, Jeffrey. “Structural Determinants of Peripheral Urbanization: The Effects of International Dependence.” American Sociological Review 46, no. 2 (April 1, 1981): 201–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Sociologist John Shandra states that arguments about the causes of overurbanization fall into five groups:
# The rural-push and urban-pull perspective
# The economic modernization perspective
# The political modernization perspective
# The neo-Malthusian perspective
# The dependency perspective&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;
Shandra's analysis of several variables related to each of these categories suggested that all of these arguments have significant evidence except for the economic modernization perspective.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt; Recent scholars believe that a variety of these factors are relevant.&lt;ref name=Bradshaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kentor/&gt;

===The rural-push and urban-pull perspective===
The biggest cause of overurbanization emphasized by scholars is rural-urban migration and the "push" factors associated with it, including "increased population, diminished size of holdings, and absentee landlord exactions."&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; Specifically, lower death rates as a result of [[demographic transition]] lead to less available land and fewer opportunities for rural residents.&lt;ref name=Firebaugh/&gt;&lt;ref name=London&gt;London, Bruce. “Structural Determinants of Third World Urban Change: An Ecological and Political Economic Analysis.” American Sociological Review 52, no. 1 (February 1, 1987): 28–43&lt;/ref&gt; The larger process of urbanization is characterized both by these factors that "push" migrants away from their homes as well as factors that "pull" them towards new areas. Davis and the UNESCO report both discuss that overurbanization is affected by the "push" factors away from rural areas being stronger than the "pull" factors. Pull factors towards urban areas include expansion of economic opportunity and the infrastructure of cities as administrative centers&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Shandra recognizes the relationship between push and pull factors, arguing that rural conditions, specifically environmental scarcity, cause decreasing income, decreased stability, and increased health risks, leading many to respond by migrating to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt; For example, drought in Brazil and [[Deforestation in the Philippines]] has made many rural residents' former manner of livelihood impossible, forcing them to move to the nearest city.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt; Because migrants are primarily motivated by factors pushing them out of rural areas rather than factors such as demand for labor pulling them to the city, these rural-urban migrants often find themselves unemployed or quitting "low productive agricultural employment to [enter] yet another section marked by low productivity employment, namely handicraft production, retail trading, domestic services in urban areas."&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; A study done by sociologist Glenn Firebaugh showed that agricultural density, a strong indicator of land constraint, and the presence plantation agriculture both have significant effects on overurbanization.&lt;ref name=Firebaugh/&gt; These findings were later reversed by sociologist Bruce London, who emphasized that urban migration was not the only potential response to agricultural density.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

Sovani argues that there is little evidence for the greater role of "push" factor of increased population in rural areas, as even countries where there is little pressure for land experience this phenomenon, but that instead the opportunity for higher income is responsible for the excessive migration and pressure on cities, as the salary for an unproductive job in an urban area was almost always higher than the salary for unproductive work in a rural area.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt;  Graves and Sexton also emphasize that individuals move despite negative factors such as overcrowding, suggesting that individuals still see urban migration as an overall benefit. They argue that if the benefits do indeed outweigh the costs for society as a whole, then the term "overurbanization" is not appropriate to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=graves/&gt; Gugler argues that while the benefits outweigh the costs for an individual migrating to an urban area, greater costs such as resource scarcity and widespread unemployment and poverty are present when this occurs at a larger scale.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;

Sovani also argues that the definition of overurbanization as developed by scholars in the 1950s and 1960s suggests some sort of limits to population density "beyond which the resulting social situation is abnormal," which he argues need to be defined more clearly.&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; Such unsupportable growth would suggest that the cause of overurbanization is urbanization happening too rapidly for a city's level of economic development.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt; Dyckman would call this the "pre-takeoff period."&lt;ref name=Dyckman/&gt; However, several scholars have questioned the validity of the connection between urbanization and industrialization.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=graves/&gt;

===The economic modernization perspective===
The economic modernization perspective on the causes of overurbanization is based on [[modernization theory]], which argues that a hierarchical progression exists from pre-modern to modern society. An explanation of overurbanization from this perspective was given by sociologist Jeffrey Kentor, who wrote that under modernization theory, urbanization results from development and industrialization creating jobs and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Kentor"/&gt; This argument has been criticized by those who do not ascribe to the assumption that there is a linear path of development that all countries follow.&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kentor/&gt;

===The political modernization perspective===
Shandra's take on the political modernization perspective asserts that environmental degradation causes overurbanization, because the destruction of natural resources in rural areas lowers production and increases poverty and health risks.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt; Supporters of the political modernization perspective suggest that a strong civil society supports lower levels of overurbanization. The presences of [[international non-governmental organizations]] (INGOs) in rural areas, political protests, and democratic government all have the ability of limiting rural-push factors by limiting factors that lead to resource scarcity.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt; INGOs can reduce overurbanization by stimulating alternative employment outside of agriculture, supporting grassroots movements, and improving rural conditions, such as by providing clean water.&lt;ref name=Bradshaf/&gt;  Considering the role of political protest, Shandra offers the example of the Chipko movement in India, where local women protested deforestation. Protection of this natural resource "eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence."&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt; Given these considerations, Shandra argues that repressive regimes that do not respond to the desires of the public are more likely to cause higher rates of urbanization than democratic governments.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;

===The neo-Malthusian perspective===
The neo-Malthusian perspective is closely related to rural-push and urban-pull factors, but it suggests that the cause behind these factors is population growth, which leads to ecological problems, decreasing agricultural activity, and increased rural poverty. These factors then push rural residents to the city.&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasarda/&gt;

===The dependency perspective===
The dependency perspective on the causes of overurbanization is based on [[dependency theory]], which argued that economic and political systems rendered less developed countries dependent on developed countries, which used developing countries for resources, labor, and markets.&lt;ref name=Timberlake&gt;Timberlake, Michael, and Jeffrey Kentor. “Economic Dependence, Overurbanization, and Economic Growth: A Study of Less Developed Countries*.” Sociological Quarterly 24, no. 4 (1983): 489–507.&lt;/ref&gt;
Proponents of the dependency perspective argue that rural-push and urban-pull factors are not only a result of population growth and resource scarcity, but that these factors, among others, are caused by the exploitation of developed countries and the capitalist principles they operate under.&lt;ref name=Kasarda/&gt;&lt;ref name=London/&gt; This is to say that "a comprehensive understanding of Third World urbanization cannot focus solely on intra-national, rural-push, urban-pull explanations...but must explicitly incorporate the impact of international capitalist forces."&lt;ref name=London/&gt;  This holds that the negative rural-push factors are a result of the manipulation of developed countries.&lt;ref name=Kasarda/&gt; Michael Kentor found that dependence on foreign investment had a lagged effect on urbanization, meaning that urbanization rates increased a few years after foreign companies began profiting in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Kentor/&gt; Jeffrey Timberlake and Michael Kentor found in their analysis of 69 less developed countries that there was a significant relationship between dependence, as measured by level of foreign investment, and overurbanization.&lt;ref name=Timberlake/&gt;  Additionally, a study done by Bruce London found that factors related to dependency were not only connected to rapid urbanization, but also the negative aspects of urbanization such as urban inequality.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

==Effects==

===Economic===
Davis and Golden did not see overurbanization as an inherently negative phenomenon, but as a statistical fact that would likely correct itself, as "urbanization will fall off sharply or industrialization will gain a new impetus."&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Expanding on the latter, they suggest that overurbanization could spur industrial growth, modernization of agriculture, and social change.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as "the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt."&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref name=graves/&gt; For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; However, Firebaugh argues that great efficiency is often a result of an increasingly  capital-intensive system, which creates inequality between large and small landowners, such as in the Latin American [[latifundia]] system.&lt;ref name=Firebaugh/&gt;  Furthermore, Timberlake and Kentor found in their analysis of economic growth and overurbanization that countries that experienced increases in levels of overurbanization experienced less economic growth.&lt;ref name=Timberlake/&gt; Economic opportunities are lacking due to "saturated urban labor markets" that exclude much of both the rural and urban populations truncated opportunity structures in rural areas.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasarda/&gt; Furthermore, high infrastructural costs stymie growth.&lt;ref name=Kasarda/&gt;

===Social===
The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing "low levels of living" as "inadequate housing,  the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality" and "large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities."&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Several scholars have agreed that overurbanization puts a strain on the wellbeing of urban residents due to the lack of adequate public services.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dyckman/&gt;

Davis and Golden also argue that greater density of dissatisfied impoverished masses could improve conditions to the extent that it provokes the government to enact change to avoid revolution.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Dyckman agreed that overurbanization lends itself to the potential for revolution, though he saw this as a potentially destabilizing factor as the conditions would lead to social dissatisfaction and seizure of control by revolutionary leaders.&lt;ref name=Dyckman/&gt; He saw informal [[squatter]] settlements as breeding ground for revolutionary activity.&lt;ref name=Dyckman/&gt;

===Employment===
Despite arguing the potential for economic growth, the UNESCO report also states that overurbanization prevents urban areas and countries from utilizing their "potential human and physical resources" due to unemployment, under-employment, and misemployment.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The idea that rural-push factors are stronger than urban-pull factors in cases of overurbanization suggests that it is population pressure in rural areas rather than the pull of urban jobs that leads to rural-urban migration.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sovani/&gt; Migrants often end up unemployed, as overall urbanization rates rise faster than industrialization and the expansion of the urban job base.&lt;ref name=Kamerschen/&gt;

In addition to high levels of unemployment, overurbanization is characterized by underemployment and misemployment.  Underemployment is defined as the "underutilization of labor," or when available laborers are not working at their full capacity due to seasonal variation in production or excess employment of laborers for the amount of work that needs to be done.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt; Misemployment is defined as unproductive labor, meaning that efforts are considered to "contribute little to social welfare," such as the full-time labor of begging.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;

While these phenomena are all caused by excessive rates of migration to cities, it is notable that unemployment and underemployment are also problems in rural areas as well. Often unemployment in rural areas is what pushes residents to the city, where better economic opportunities are expected.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
A UNESCO report that discussed overurbanization in Asia suggested initial proposals that addressed rural-push factors such as lack of economic opportunity and low productivity by improving agricultural technology and supporting rural industries. Furthermore, rural misery could be reduced by bringing industrialization into rural areas to increase employment and wages and to support the development of infrastructure that creates a "more desirable community environment."&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The UNESCO report also considers the role of governments in committing to providing adequate housing as well as regional planning that takes into consideration social concerns.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; However, these considerations, among others that propose dealing with unemployment, have been criticized as "skirting the issue by addressing 'symptoms' of overurbanization" rather than the root cause.&lt;ref name=graves/&gt;

Later authors also emphasized improving rural conditions to combat overurbanization. Gugler suggested channeling more resources to rural areas and fighting the tendency to neglect rural areas with what economist [[Michael Lipton]] deemed "[[urban bias]]," the tendency to allocate funds and public works to cities, where the elite and middle classes reside.&lt;ref name=Gugler/&gt; For example, monetary policies that create artificially low prices for agricultural products harm farmers while creating a surplus for the government. Thus a reallocation of resources to agricultural workers would help shift this system that favors urban elites over the rural poor.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw&gt;Bradshaw, York W. “Overurbanization and Underdevelopment in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Cross-National Study.” Studies In Comparative International Development 20, no. 3 (September 1, 1985): 74–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists York Bradshaw and Mark Schafer studied the relationship between INGOs and overurbanization and found that state expenditures towards development were less effective than the role of INGOs. While INGOs were shown statistically to decrease overurbanization, the presence of INGOS did not decrease the effects of foreign capital investment, which is considered one of the root causes of overurbanization by dependency theorists.&lt;ref name=Bradshaf/&gt; They and Shandra agree that INGOs can play an important role in decreasing overurbanization by supporting rural communities by promoting both economic and infrastructural development as well as the role of civic society.&lt;ref name=Bradshaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shandra/&gt;

==Case studies==

===Egypt===
Davis and Golden offered the example of Egypt as a country that significantly deviated from the normal relationship between urbanization and economic development. They argue that population growth in rural areas created congestion, poverty, and unemployment. They point out that only 10 percent of economically active males in rural areas are employed in non-agricultural work, compared to 50 percent in France, suggesting that there are no economic opportunities in rural areas in Egypt outside of farming.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Egypt had similar levels of urbanization in the late 1940s to Sweden, Switzerland, and France, but significantly lower levels of industrialization. Based on the normal relationship Davis and Golden found between urbanization and industrialization, Egypt had higher levels of urbanization than expected.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; Dyckman gives an example of a consequence of urbanization in Cairo when he explains that urban dwellers actually have lower literacy rates than those in surrounding villages due to a lack of development.&lt;ref name="Dyckman" /&gt;

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
[[File:DonaldsonvillePeepShow1938.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938]]

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Proto-fascism''' refers to the direct predecessor ideologies and cultural movements that influenced and formed the basis of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent proto-fascist figure is [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], the [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] whose politics influenced [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-fascist political movements include the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), the [[German National Association of Commercial Employees]] (DHV) and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precedence to modern fascism can be seen in the culture and government of older nations based heavily on law and order, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[ancien régime|anciens régimes]] of Europe.

Other people that have been labeled proto-fascist are [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Maurras]] and [[Ion Dragoumis]] (by John Mazis in his book "A Man For All Seasons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ethnikonkratos.gr/2017/06/05/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BC%CE%AC%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%AD%CF%87%CF%89-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BC/|title=Γιάννης Μάζης: «Ο Δραγούμης δεν έχω καμία αμφιβολία ότι ήταν ένας πρωτοφασίστας»|date=2017-06-04|work=Εθνικόν Κράτος|access-date=2018-10-23|language=el-GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Colin Steele, a librarian at the [[Australian National Library]] in [[Canberra]], "Listings of publishers by title also fail to take into account that some university presses are strong in certain disciplines, but not across the whole spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Colin.

== {{anchor|SENSE Rankings}}SENSE rankings ==
The [[Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment]] (SENSE Research School) ranked scientific publishers in 2006.&lt;ref name="SENSEdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense.nl/organisation/documentation|title=SENSE - Quality &amp; Criteria|website=www.sense.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; SENSE works in conjunction with the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW), in accordance with the standard evaluation protocol for Dutch universities. The school developed its ranking in conjunction with performance criteria for its staff. rating A, B, and C journals and A, B, C, D, and E publishers. A-publishers are ranking scheme,&lt;ref name="SENSEranking"&gt;http://www.sense.nl/gfx_content/documents/ABCDE-indeling%20Scientific%20Publishers%20SENSE_approved_May_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the "few top-notch international publishers"; B-publishers are "good international publishers";&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; C-publishers are "decent international publishers and excellent national publishers";&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; D-publishers are "professional publications published by major international organisations and good national publishers",&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; and E-publishers are "publications mainly published for a non-academic general public by national organisations and small local publishers". The SENSE Ranking was recognized in [[bibliometric]] literature&lt;ref&gt;Zuccala, Alesia, et al. "Can we rank scholarly book publishers? A bibliometric experiment with the field of history." Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 66.7 (2015): 1333-1347; Torres-Salinas, Daniel, et al. "The BiPublishers ranking: Main results and methodological problems when constructing rankings of academic publishers." arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.01074 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities' attempts to rate publishers.&lt;ref&gt;see for example the ranking, provided by the [[Education University of Hong Kong]] https://www.ied.edu.hk/include_n/getrichfile.php?key=95030d9da8144788e3752da05358f071&amp;secid=50424&amp;filename=secstaffcorner/research_doc/Compiled_Publisher_List.pdf This "Hong Kong" ranking quotes rankings by the [[Australian Political Studies Association]]; and another publisher ranking system of the Centre for Resource Studies for Human Development (CERES) of the [[University of Utrecht]] in addition to the SENSE Ranking. The "Hong Kong" ranking emphasizes the high correlation between all these ranking attempts by explicitly stating "There was a high level of consistency in the ranking of Book Publishers among the three systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest SENSE ranking, like its previous rankings, is based on the subjective assessment of a publisher by prominent Dutch and international scientists. An [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] table is available at the school's website.&lt;ref name="SENSEdoc" /&gt;

== Spanish National Research Council rankings ==
In 2012 and 2014, the [[Spanish National Research Council]] asked 11,864 Spanish academics to name the 10 most prestigious academic publishers from over 600 international and 500 Spanish-language publishers. It received 2,731 responses, a response rate of 23.05 percent, asking them to name. Votes were counted in a complex mathematical procedure described at the ranking project's website.&lt;ref name="CSIC"&gt;http://ilia.cchs.csic.es/SPI/metodologia_2014.html and http://ilia.cchs.csic.es/SPI/prestigio_expertos_2014.php&lt;/ref&gt; The results were:

{{quote|Libcitation counts reflect judgments by librarians on the usefulness of publications for their various audiences of readers. The Libcitation measure thus resembles a citation impact measure in discriminating values of publications on a defined ground. It rewards authors whose books (or other publications) are seen by librarians as having relatively wide appeal. A book's absolute appeal can be determined simply by counting how many libraries hold it, but it can also be gauged in relation to other books in its subject class.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;}}

[[Libcitation]]s, according to the RIMS, reflect what librarians know about the prestige of publishers, the opinions of reviewers, and the reputations of authors.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

To quantitatively assess the output of a publishing company, a research group associated with the [[University of Granada]] created a methodology based on the [[Thomson-Reuters]] [[Book Citation Index]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Torres-Salinas, D., Robinson-García, N., Campanario, J.M. &amp; Delgado López-Cózar, E. (2013). Coverage, specialization and impact of scientific publishers in the Book Citation Index. Online Information Review, 38(1) and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267869924_Bibliometric_Indicators_for_Publishers_Data_processing_indicators_and_interpretation&lt;/ref&gt; The quantitative weight of the publishers is based on output data, impact (citations) and publisher profile. According to the Granada study, the 10 leading companies were [[Springer Publishing|Springer]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], [[Routledge]], [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Elsevier]], [[Nova Science Publishers]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Information Age Publishing]], [[Princeton University Press]], and [[University of California Press]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a later study,&lt;ref&gt;Tausch, Arno (2017), Die Buchpublikationen der Nobelpreis-Ökonomen und die führenden Buchverlage der Disziplin. Eine bibliometrische Analyse (The book publications of the Nobel-Prize economists and the leading book publishers of the discipline. A bibliometric analysis).' Bibliotheksdienst, March 2017: 339 – 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] used six main indicators for 57 companies with data from the SENSE and the Granada studies. The study, which relied on the Thomson Reuters Book Citation Index, also used the [[Harvard Library]] ratio of books checked out to the total stock available in the catalog; the 2015 outreach of a company in typical scientific global cultures (Japan, Sweden and India); the presence of a publisher's output in international organizations such as the [[European Commission]] in Brussels (the [[ECLAS catalog]]) and the [[World Bank]], and references to the company in newspapers such as the ''[[New York Times]]''. A 2011 Tausch study analysed the library outreach of a company in the [[OCLC]] [[WorldCat]].&lt;ref&gt;Such an attempt limited to 21 companies in the field of social sciences was published in Tausch, A. (2011). On the Global Impact of Selected Social-Policy Publishers in More Than 100 Countries. Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 42(4), 476-513.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12370">In response to the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]] (DESD, 2005-2014), the [[United Nations University]] (UNU) called for the development of regional networks for the promotion of [[Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD). These networks address local sustainable development challenges through research and capacity development. This was the birth of '''Regional Centres of Expertise''' on ESD (RCEs). RCEs are acknowledged by the UNU based on recommendations of the Ubuntu Committee of Peers for the RCEs, which consists of signatories of the [https://www.un.org/events/wssd/pressconf/020901conf1.htm Ubuntu Declaration] signed in 2002.

RCEs aspire to achieve the goals of the DESD by translating its global objectives into the context of the local communities in which they operate. This is then accomplished by acting as a catalyst for institutions that promote ESD through formal, non-formal and informal education, and by providing suitable platforms to share information and experiences and to promote dialogue among regional stakeholders through partnerships for sustainable development. They also develop regional knowledge bases to support ESD and promote its goals in a resource effective manner. This can be achieved through the delivery of training programmes, by facilitating research into ESD, through public awareness raising, and by increasing the quality and access to ESD in the region.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.ias.unu.edu/sub_page.aspx?catID=108&amp;ddlID=183

 |archivedate = 2007-06-11
 |df          = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An RCE should have four core elements:

* Governance - addressing issues of RCE management and leadership
* Collaboration - addressing the engagement of actors from all levels of formal, non-formal and informal education
* Research and development - addressing the role of research and its inclusion in RCE activities, as well as contributing to the design of strategies for collaborative activities, including those with other RCEs
* Transformative education - contributing to the transformation of the current education and training systems to satisfy ambitions of the region regarding sustainable living and livelihood.

RCEs also have four major ESD goals to be promoted in an effective way:

* Re-orienting education towards SD, by covering integrating SD and ESD into the current curriculum and tailoring it to address issues and local context of the community in which they operate;
* Increase access to quality education that is most needed in the regional context;
* Deliver trainers’ training programmes and to develop methodologies and learning materials for them;
* Lead advocacy and awareness raising efforts to raise public awareness about the importance of educators and the essential role of ESD in achieving a sustainable future. RCEs promote the long-term goals of ESD, such as environmental stewardship, social justice, and improvement of the quality of life.

RCEs are not only significant for the region itself, where they provide a unique opportunity to promote learning and development for SD, but also important at international level where they help to constitute the Global Learning Space for Sustainable Development. Globally, RCEs are facilitated through the [http://www.ias.unu.edu United Nations University Institute for Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS)] who provide a framework for strategy, best practice and techniques for success, which can then be translated to the regional level.

RCEs have recently{{when|date=November 2018}} been acknowledged in the 2009 Bonn Declaration which calls for action to “develop knowledge through ESD networking” through “networks that could serve as centres of expertise and innovation”.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Scott Sunken Garden''' is a historical landmark in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States of America.

The outer foundation walls are 51 feet by 79 feet and the center is a 28 feet by 45 feet lawn. There are shorter [[limestone]] walls lining the court with raised flower beds. The west side and east sides have limestone steps leading to a small water pond below the grotto center piece. This foundation of Justice Edward Cahill's home was redesigned after 1930 by a new American immigrant, Nick Kriek. The gardening includes bulbs, annuals, perennials and a list of species introduced to the area by Kriek himself.
The garden has been maintained by the Greater Lansing Garden Club for 3 decades; they restored it after a few decades of neglect by the city.&lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tncp.net/Articles/tabid/1800/articletype/ArticleView/articleID/2475/Default.aspx |title=History of Scott Sunken Garden and Its Restoration &gt; The New Citizens Press &amp;#124; TNCP &amp;#124; Lansing Michigan News &gt; TNCP &amp;#124; Greater Lansing MI News |publisher=tncp.net|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scott Sunken Garden landmark has a list of historically significant ties including 1930's "Golden Age of American Landscaping", Immigration, Civil Rights, and Lansing's Beautification.&lt;ref name="Non-profit Community Advocacy Organized for Scott Sunken Gardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden |title=Scott Sunken Garden, Friends |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

National Register Coordinator for the State of Michigan state that the Scott Sunken Garden Is eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].... The garden appears to meet national register criteria B and C...." &lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-sunken-garden-friends/national-register-coordinators-recommendation-of-scott-sunken-gardens-historical/1027945290586784 |title=National Register Coordinator’s recommendation of Scott Sunken Garden’s historical recognition as a national asset |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Even though the Scott House  itself – the house  that stood just west of the garden near the Jenison House/Scott Center –  that formed the central feature of the property no longer exists, the  garden stands out as a fine example of formal landscape garden design  from the early twentieth century (various dates  of construction from the mid-1920s to 1934-35 have been reported). As  far as I’ve been able to determine from all the recent discussions, the  garden is unique in Lansing as a formal garden that, designed for an  urban residential setting, dates from the early  twentieth century period when landscaped gardens and estates associated  with them reached a height of design perfection, during what has been  called the “Golden Age of American Landscape Design.” The Scott Sunken  Garden, in my mind, possesses additional significance  as a prime achievement of a local Lansing artisan, Nick or Nicolaas  Isaac Willem Kriek. Kriek (1895–1978) was born in the Netherlands and, settling in Lansing in the early 1920s, founded the Cottage Gardens  nursery in 1923. Bill Hicks, Mr. Kriek’s grandson  and today part of the still operating family-owned business, states  that Nick Kriek built the Sunken Garden for Scott, from whom he had  purchased the property on which the Cottage Gardens nursery was  established in 1923. It seems logical to think that Kriek  had a major hand in designing the garden to meet the Scotts’ wishes and  requirements. The garden also possesses importance for its direct  association with an important Lansing citizen, Richard H. Scott, who  owned the property and had the garden created. Marilyn  Lee’s 2010 history of the garden states that Scott came to Lansing in  1898 to work for auto pioneer R. E. Olds and helped organize Olds’ Reo  Motor Car Company and served as president of the company after Olds  retired in 1923."
&lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority" /&gt;
This Scott Sunken Garden foundation is presumed to be the remains of Justice Edward Cahill's Lansing home. He moved to Lansing after serving in the Civil War and went to war serving beside African American soldiers in Michigan's 102nd USCI on a campaign through southern states. Justice Edward Cahill served in the Michigan Supreme Court in 1890.&lt;ref name="Men of Progress, Embracing Biographical Sketches of Representative Michigan Men With an Outline History of the State, Dedicated to the Newspaper Press of Michigan Detroit, Michigan Published by the Evening News Association 1900"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/137660544586/permalink/10154507434494587/ |title=Historical Society of Greater Lansing public group &amp;#124; Facebook &amp;#124; "Men of Progress" |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Cahill also concurred upholding [[Racial equality]] in USA's landmark Civil Right's "William W.

The local chapter of this national garden club has a long history with both the Scott Sunken Garden and the Scott Center. The club met at the Scott Center before it was moved to Scott Park and the Garden Club invested the financing to restoration of this landmark garden through the early 80s. The city actually fell short of original expectations and the Garden Club even paid for a restoration of the lower wall of the Scott Sunken Garden &lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010" /&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Scott Garden Grotto.jpg|thumb|]]
The city is in need of widespread upgrades to the Power Grid infrastructure inducing several substations to replace the older Eckert Substation next to the Eckert Power Station. The [[Lansing Board of Water and Light]] (LBWL) and Mayor Virg Bernero have pushed for a large Central Substation with their proposal to destroy a riverside park (Scott Park) and to remove historical integrity of its historical landmark of Scott Sunken Garden.

===LBWL Proposals===

The LBWL had submitted an original proposal to the Lansing Parks and Recreation then amended it during the review by the Lansing Planning Board. These Board's are appointed by the Mayor and their decisions are being reviewed by the Lansing City Council.

===Parkland Advocacy===

The Scott Sunken Garden caretakers of 3 decades, the Greater Lansing Garden Club, has declined the LBWL offer of the new garden wanting the historical garden to remain in tact. Each public board meeting and the public meeting held by Jessica Yorko (as Lansing City Council, 4th Ward Representative) were occupied with citizen advocates. There are multiple community organizations publicly advocating saving Scott Sunken Garden, and its Scott Park; "Preservation Lansing" has advocated this along with a list of other historical concerns in the area; [http://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden "Friends of Scott Sunken Garden Park"] is a non-profit advocacy organization instituted for protecting Scott Sunken Garden and its neighboring assets of the People of Lansing.

====Public Petitions====

Original Petition for Lansing Parks and Recreation: "Save Scott Park and the Sunken Garden"

Request for more ideal alternative and assistance with concerns by officials: "Two Downtown Lansing Substations Audit and Investigation into Concerns by Mayor and LBW" &lt;ref name="Scott Sunken Garden advocacy petitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lansinggarden.com/petitions |title=Public petitions |publisher=lansinggarden.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], '''privilege''' is a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/privilege | title=Privilege &amp;#124; Definition of privilege in English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], privilege is the [[perceived]] rights or advantages that are assumed to be available only to a particular person or group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Lucal, B., 1996.

Teaching Sociology, pp.245-255.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1318739?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in the context of [[social inequality]], particularly in regard to [[ageism|age]], [[disability]], [[Race (human classification)|ethnic or racial category]], [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], and [[social class]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Geographies of Privilege |last = Twine |first = France Winddance |publisher = Routledge |year = 2013 |isbn = 978-0415519618 |location = |pages = 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two common examples involve having access to a higher education and housing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under a newer usage of the term, privilege can also be emotional or psychological, regarding comfort and personal self-confidence, or having a sense of belonging or worth in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Privilege: A Reader |last = Kimmel |first = Michael S. |publisher = Westview Press |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0813344263 |location = |pages = 1, 5, 13–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as an academic concept, but has since been invoked more widely, outside of academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/05/check-your-privilege-means |title= Check your privilege!

== History ==
[[File:Du Bois, W. E. B..jpg|thumb|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], author of the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]].'']]
The concept of privilege dates back to 1903 when American [[sociologist]] and [[historian]] [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] published the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', in which he wrote that although [[African American]]s were observant about [[white Americans]] and conscious of [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|racial discrimination]], white Americans did not think much about African Americans, nor about the effects of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege|last = Sullivan|first = Shannon|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0253218483|location = |pages = 121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = W.E.B.

In 1988, American [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-racism activist [[Peggy McIntosh]] published the essay ''White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences through Work in Women’s Studies'', in which she documented forty-six privileges which she, as a white person, experienced in the United States. For example: "I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me", and "I do not have to educate my children to be aware of [[systemic racism]] for their own daily physical protection". McIntosh described [[white privilege]] as an "invisible package of unearned assets" which white people do not want to acknowledge, and which leads to them being confident, comfortable, and oblivious about racial issues, while non-white people become unconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McIntosh's essay has been credited for stimulating academic interest in privilege, which has been extensively studied in the decades since.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last = O'Brien|first = Jodi A.|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1412909167|location = |pages = 418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Princeton University]] first-year student Tal Fortgang wrote ''Checking My Privilege'', a widely debated article in which he condemned classmates who told him to "check his privilege" for attributing his success in life to "some invisible patron saint of white maleness", and "for casting the equal protection clause, indeed the very idea of a meritocracy, as a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theprincetontory.com/main/checking-my-privilege-character-as-the-basis-of-privilege/|title=Checking My Privilege: Character as the Basis of Privilege|last=Fortgang|first=Tal|date=2 April 2014|work=The Princeton Tory|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh afterwards told the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]'' that Fortgang was resisting seeing himself systemically. She argued that everybody has a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage, and should aim to try to see themselves in the context of societal patterns of discrimination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|title=The Origins of Privilege|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|date=13 May 2014|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Historically, academic study of social inequality focused mainly on the ways in which minority groups were discriminated against, and ignored the privileges accorded to dominant social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in the late 1980s, when researchers began studying the concept of privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Privilege, as understood and described by researchers, is a function of multiple variables of varying importance, such as [[racism|race]], [[ageism|age]], [[genderism|gender]], [[heteronormativity|sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[citizenship]], [[religion]], [[physical ability]], health, level of education, and others. Race, gender and social class are generally felt by sociologists to be the most determinative of a person's overall level of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Archaeology of Plural and Changing Identities: Beyond Identification|last = Casella|first = Eleanor C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2005|isbn = 9780306486944|location = |pages = 217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNhM_dsYIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege theory argues that each individual is embedded in a matrix of categories and contexts, and will be in some ways privileged and other ways disadvantaged, with privileged attributes lessening disadvantage and membership in a disadvantaged group lessening the benefits of privilege.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Experiences|last = Garnets|first = Linda|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0231124133|location = |pages = 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a white [[lesbian]] [[Professor|university professor]] benefits from racial and educational privilege, but is disadvantaged due to her gender and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some attributes of privilege are ordinarily fairly visible, such as race and gender, and others, such as citizenship status and birth order, are not. Some such as social class are relatively stable and others, such as age, wealth, religion and attractiveness, will or may change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in the Therapy Hour: Voices of Female Clinicians Working with Men (The Routledge Series on Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men)|last = Sweet|first = Holly Barlow|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0415885515|location = |pages = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attributes of privilege are at least partly determined by the individual, such as level of education, whereas others such as race or class background are entirely involuntary.

In the context of the theory, privileged people are considered to be "the norm", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the privileged person will succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|last = Sorrells|first = Kathryn|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1412927444|location = |pages = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness of privilege ==
Some academics{{such as|date=October 2018}} highlight a pattern where those who benefit from a type of privilege are unwilling to acknowledge it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Racial-Cultural Psychology and Counseling, Training and Practice|last = Carter|first = Robert T.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0471386292|location = |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes the state of having privilege as being "like running with the wind at your back", unaware of invisible sustenance, support and propulsion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The argument may follow that such a denial constitutes a further injustice against those who do not benefit from the same form of privilege.  One writer{{who|date=October 2018}} has referred to such denial as a form of "[[microaggression]]" or microinvalidation that negates the experiences of people who don't have privilege and minimizes the impediments they face.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation|last = Sue|first = Derald Wing|publisher = Wiley|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0470491409|location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIntosh wrote that most people are reluctant to acknowledge their privilege, and instead look for ways to justify or minimize the effects of privilege stating that their privilege was fully earned. They justify this by acknowledging the acts of individuals of unearned dominance, but deny that privilege is institutionalized as well as embedded throughout our society. She wrote that those who believe privilege is systemic may nonetheless deny having personally benefited from it, and may oppose efforts to dismantle it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to researchers{{who|date=October 2018}}, privileged individuals resist acknowledging their privileges because doing so would require them to acknowledge that whatever success they have achieved did not result solely through their own efforts. Instead it was partly due to a system that has developed to support them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The concept of privilege calls into question the idea that society is a [[meritocracy]], which researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued is particularly unsettling for Americans for whom belief that they live in a meritocracy is a deeply held cultural value, and one that researchers commonly characterize as a [[Meritocracy#Criticism|myth]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deconstructing Privilege: Teaching and Learning as Allies in the Classroom|last = Case|first = Kim|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0415641463|location = |pages =63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School (Princeton Studies in Cultural Sociology)|last = Khan|first = Shamus Rahman|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0691156231|location = |pages = 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology|last = Jackson|first = Yolanda Kaye|publisher = SAGE Publications|location = |pages = 471 |isbn=9781452265568 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AP1yAwAAQBAJ |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gendered Society'', Michael Kimmel wrote that when privileged people do not feel personally powerful, arguments that they have benefited from unearned advantages seem unpersuasive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Seeing White: An Introduction to White Privilege and Race|last = Halley|first = Jean|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1442203075|location = |pages = 67, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

=== Examples of Privilege ===

====Workplace sexism====
{{synthesis|reason="Is that statistically significant?"|date=October 2018}}
Hays, a recruitment firm, sent the same job application to thousands of employers, only changing the name. One was "Simon", the other "Susan". Experienced hiring managers offered "Simon" an interview 15% more often than "Susan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/the-same-resume-with-different-names-nets-different-results/news-story/a2a182fb4570e948c27ce63139ee66b1 | title=The same resume with different names nets different results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational Racism====
According to McKinley et al.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Students of color are pushed toward academic failure and continued social disenfranchisement. Racist policies and beliefs, in part, explain why children and young adults from racially marginalized groups fail to achieve academically at the same rate as their White peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy, Angelina E. Castagno and Emma Maughan
Review of Research in Education 
Vol. 31, Difference, Diversity, and Distinctiveness in Education and Learning (2007), pp. 159-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of privilege has been criticized for ignoring relative differences among groups. For example, Lawrence Blum argued that in American culture there are status differences among [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Indian American|Indians]], [[Korean American|Koreans]], and [[Cambodian American|Cambodians]], and among [[African American]]s, black immigrants from the [[Caribbean American|Caribbean]], and black immigrants from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/publications/publications/A57.pdf|title='White privilege': A mild critique|first=Lawrence|last=Blum|date=2008|journal=Theory and Research in Education|volume=6|doi=10.1177/1477878508095586|issue=6(3) |pages=309–321|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum agreed that privilege exists and is systemic yet nonetheless criticized the label itself, saying that the word "privilege" implies luxuries rather than rights, and arguing that some benefits of privilege such as unimpeded access to [[education]] and [[housing]] would be better understood as rights.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; "[[White privilege]]", Michael Monahan argued, would be more accurately described as the advantages gained by whites through historical disenfranchisement of non-whites rather than something that gives whites privilege above and beyond normal human status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Monahan, Michael J.|year=2014|title=The concept of privilege: a critical appraisal|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1080/02580136.2014.892681|issn=0258-0136|eissn=2073-4867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">'''Steklov Institute of Mathematics''' or '''Steklov Mathematical Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Математический институт имени В.А.Стеклова}}) is a premier research institute based in [[Moscow]], specialized in [[mathematics]], and a part of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The institute is named after [[Vladimir Andreevich Steklov]], who in 1919 founded the Institute of Physics and Mathematics in  [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. In 1934, this institute was split into separate parts for physics and mathematics, and the mathematical part became the Steklov Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|first=Yakov|last=Sinai|authorlink=Yakov Sinai|publisher=World Scientific|year=2003|isbn=9789812383853|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC&amp;pg=PA38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it was moved to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, pp. 530 and 697.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first director of the Steklov Institute was [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961-1964, the institute's director was the notable mathematician [[Sergei Chernikov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ershov|first1=Y.L. et al.|title=Sergei Nikolaevich Chernikov (obituary)|journal=Russian Math.

The old building of the Institute in Leningrad became its Department in Leningrad. Today, that department has become a separate institute, called the ''[[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences]]'' or '''PDMI RAS''', located in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The name ''St. Petersburg Department'' is misleading, however, because the St. Petersburg Department is now an independent institute. In 1966, the Moscow-based [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] (Russian: Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша) split off from the Steklov Institute.

'''TRIAD Berlin''' is a German [[exhibition design]] firm based in [[Berlin]] with an office in [[Shanghai]]. The agency is best known for the development of two major sports museums: the [[German Football Museum]] in [[Dortmund]] and the [[FIFA World Football Museum]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/football-in-museums/av-19083717 |title=Football in museums|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Expo 2010 Shanghai, Urban Planet Pavilion.jpg|thumb|''Urban Planet'' pavilion, Expo 2010 Shanghai]]
The Berlin agency was founded in 1994 by Lutz Engelke to realize the exhibition ''The Dream of Vision – Age of Televisions'' at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] in the city of [[Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/koepfe/triad-berlin-eine-agentur-mit-der-besonderen-dna/12526828.html|title=Eine Agentur mit der besonderen DNA|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=1 November 2015|access-date=2018-03-16|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After designing the theme pavilion ''[[Expo 2010 pavilions#Urban Planet Pavilion|Urban Planet]]'' at [[Expo 2010]], the company also has an additional permanent office in Shanghai, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-11/02/content_11489135.htm |title=How to build cities with character|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency focusses on spatial communication and sees itself as a ''Think &amp; Do Tank''. Its main goal is to turn complex ideas into tangible experiences. Although the content of the projects varies, the method used for their development is always the same: the creation of stories that can be experienced from abstract ideas. A key component of this process is the development of a narrative that structures the messages and guides the visitor through the exhibition. Most of the times, the [[storytelling]] is enhanced by digital media. TRIAD exhibitions rely heavily on digital interactive exhibits with the intention of bridging the gap between the intellectual learning process and the physical experience. In many cases, TRIAD combines education and entertainment in a multimedia space. The result is the so-called [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]], whose goal is to educate through entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Engelke/Osswald, 2017, p. 964.&lt;/ref&gt;

TRIAD has applied edutainment concepts to various projects focused on children's education, such as the 2018 exhibition on the [[MS Wissenschaft]] about working life of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ms-wissenschaft.de/english/ |title=MS Wissenschaft – The Floating Science Center|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the company has used this approach in the [[Brandenburg Gate Museum]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/emotionen-am-tor-the-gate-zeigt-stadtgeschichte-in-einer-multimedia-show/13511474.html|title="The Gate" zeigt Stadtgeschichte in einer Multimedia-Show|access-date=2017-03-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also tackling other challenges that exhibitions face today, like the creation of barrier-free museums. An example of this is the exhibition ''Wilderness Dreams'' in [[Eifel National Park]] which is part of the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.undekade-biologischevielfalt.de/projekte/aktuelle-projekte-beitraege/detail/projekt-details/show/Wettbewerb/1863/?cHash=59202f3f0faf587a430c6400f5b54774&amp;L=0 |title=„Wildnis(t)räume im Nationalpark-Zentrum Eifel|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26578">'''Thermal depolymerization''' ('''TDP''') is a [[depolymerization]] process using [[hydrous pyrolysis]] for the reduction of complex [[organic material]]s (usually [[waste]] products of various sorts, often [[biomass]] and [[plastic]]) into light [[crude oil]]. It mimics the natural [[geology|geological]] processes thought to be involved in the production of [[fossil fuel]]s. Under pressure and heat, long chain [[polymer]]s of [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon]] decompose into short-chain [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s with a maximum length of around 18 [[carbon]]s.

==Similar processes==
Thermal depolymerisation is similar to other processes which use [[superheated water]] as a major step to produce fuels, such as direct [[Hydrothermal Liquefaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Biomass Program, direct Hydrothermal Liquefaction| work =| publisher =US Department of Energy.

These are distinct from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as [[pyrolysis]]. The term Thermochemical Conversion (TCC) has also been used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via pyrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other commercial scale processes include the "SlurryCarb" process operated by EnerTech, which uses similar technology to decarboxylate wet solid biowaste, which can then be physically dewatered and used as a solid fuel called E-Fuel. The plant in Rialto, California was designed to process 683 tons of waste per day.   However, it failed to perform to design standards and was closed down.  The Rialto facility defaulted on its bond payments and is in the process of being liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

Thermal depolymerization is similar to the geological processes that produced the fossil fuels used today, except that the technological process occurs in a timeframe measured in hours. Until recently, the [[human]]-designed processes were not efficient enough to serve as a practical source of fuel&amp;mdash;more [[energy]] was required than was produced.

The first industrial process to obtain gas, [[diesel fuel]]s and other petroleum products through pyrolysis of coal, tar or biomass was designed and patented in the late 1920s by [[Fischer-Tropsch]]. In U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=-MlwAAAAEBAJ 2,177,557], issued in 1939, Bergstrom and Cederquist discuss a method for obtaining oil from wood in which the wood is heated under pressure in water with a significant amount of [[calcium hydroxide]] added to the mixture. In the early 1970s Herbert R. Appell and coworkers worked with hydrous pyrolysis methods, as exemplified by U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=UEU9AAAAEBAJ 3,733,255] (issued in 1973), which discusses the production of oil from sewer [[sludge]] and municipal refuse by heating the material in water, under pressure, and in the presence of [[carbon monoxide]].

An approach that exceeded [[break-even]] was developed by [[Illinois]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Paul Baskis]] in the 1980s and refined over the next 15 years  (see U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=0LYmAAAAEBAJ 5,269,947], issued in 1993). The technology was finally developed for commercial use in 1996 by [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT). [[Brian S. Appel]] (CEO of CWT) took the technology in 2001 and expanded and changed it into what is now referred to as TCP (Thermal Conversion Process), and has applied for and obtained several patents (see, for example, published patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=KxbsAQAAEBAJ 8,003,833], issued August 23, 2011). A Thermal Depolymerization demonstration plant was completed in 1999 in [[Philadelphia]] by Thermal Depolymerization, LLC, and the first full-scale commercial plant was constructed in [[Carthage, Missouri]], about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from [[ConAgra Foods]]' massive [[Butterball]] turkey plant, where it is expected to process about 200 [[ton]]s of [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] waste into {{convert|500|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day.

==Theory and process==

In the method used by CWT, the water improves the heating process and contributes hydrogen to the reactions.

In the [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT) process,&lt;ref&gt;The description of the operation of the process, including temperatures, pressures, and time, has been adapted from the description in Brad Lemley (May 2003). [http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover. See also the description of the operation of the process in Appel et al., published U. S. patent application US [http://www.google.com/patents?id=VrGfAAAAEBAJ 2004/0192980], publication date September 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; the feedstock material is first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water if it is especially dry. It is then fed into a [[pressure vessel]] reaction chamber where it is heated at [[isochoric process|constant volume]] to around 250 °[[Celsius|C]]. Similar to a [[pressure cooker]] (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 [[MPa]]) (near the point of [[Boiling point|saturated water]]). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: [[Flash evaporation]]). The result is a mix of crude hydrocarbons and solid [[mineral]]s. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by [[fractional distillation]], in a process similar to conventional [[oil refining]].

The CWT company claims that 15 to 20% of feedstock energy is used to provide energy for the plant. The remaining energy is available in the converted product. Working with turkey [[offal]] as the feedstock, the process proved to have yield efficiencies of approximately 85%; in other words, the energy contained in the end products of the process is 85% of the energy contained in the inputs to the process (most notably the energy content of the feedstock, but also including electricity for pumps and natural gas or [[woodgas]] for heating). If one considers the energy content of the feedstock to be free (i.e., waste material from some other process), then 85 units of energy are made available for every 15 units of energy consumed in process heat and electricity. This means the "[[EROEI|Energy Returned on Energy Invested]]" (EROEI) is (6.67), which is comparable to other energy harvesting processes. Higher efficiencies may be possible with drier and more carbon-rich feedstocks, such as waste [[plastic]].

By comparison, the current processes{{specify|date=July 2015}} used to produce [[alcohol as fuel|ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] from [[agriculture|agricultural]] sources have EROEI in the 4.2 range, when the energy used to produce the feedstocks is accounted for (in this case, usually [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn]], [[soybean]]s and the like). These EROEI values are not directly comparable, because these EROEI calculations include the energy cost to produce the feedstock, whereas the above EROEI calculation for thermal depolymerization process (TDP) does not.

The process breaks down almost all materials that are fed into it. TDP even efficiently breaks down many types of hazardous materials, such as [[poison]]s and difficult-to-destroy biological agents such as [[prion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Andrew A.|last2=Vogel|first2=Frédéric|last3=Lachance|first3=Russell P.|last4=Fröling|first4=Morgan|last5=Antal, Jr.|first5=Michael J.|last6=Tester|first6=Jefferson W.|title=Thermochemical biofuel production in hydrothermal media: A review of sub- and supercritical water technologies|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=35|doi=10.1039/B810100K|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.3674}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this.

===Carthage plant products===
As reported on 04/02/2006 by [[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]], a [[Carthage, Missouri]] plant was producing {{convert|500|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of oil made from 270 tons of turkey entrails and 20 tons of hog lard. This represents an oil yield of 22.3 percent. The Carthage plant produces API 40+, a high value crude oil. It contains light and heavy [[naphtha]]s, a [[kerosene]], and a [[gas oil]] fraction, with essentially no heavy fuel oils, tars, asphaltenes or waxes. It can be further refined to produce No. 2 and No. 4 [[fuel oil]]s.

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"

The fixed carbon solids produced by the TDP process have multiple uses as a filter, a fuel source and a fertilizer. It can be used as activated carbon in [[wastewater]] treatment, as a fertilizer, or as a fuel similar to [[coal]].

==Advantages==
The process can break down organic poisons, due to breaking chemical bonds and destroying the molecular shape needed for the poison's activity. It is likely to be highly effective at killing pathogens, including [[prion]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this. PrPSc does not break down by burning and I have not heard anything about high pressure and temperature (autoclaving does not work|date=September 2011}} It can also safely remove [[heavy metals]] from the samples by converting them from their ionized or organometallic forms to their stable oxides which can be safely separated from the other products.

Along with similar processes, it is a method of recycling the energy content of organic materials without first removing the water. It can produce liquid fuel, which separates from the water physically without need for drying. Other methods to recover energy often require pre-drying (e.g. [[burning]], [[pyrolysis]]) or produce gaseous products (e.g. [[anaerobic digestion]]).

==Potential sources of waste inputs==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that in 2006 there were 251 million tons of municipal solid [[waste]], or 4.6 pounds generated per day per person in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/facts.htm Municipal Solid Waste - Basic Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this mass is considered unsuitable for oil conversion.

==Limitations==
The process only breaks long molecular chains into shorter ones, so small molecules such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]] cannot be converted to oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that is an essential part of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power plant]], consisting of a [[gas turbine]] which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a [[feed-in tariff]] scheme. This also increases the overall efficiency of the process (already said to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).

Another option is to sell the methane product as [[biogas]]. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]].

Many agricultural and animal wastes could be processed, but many of these are already used as [[fertilizer]], animal feed, and, in some cases, as feedstocks for [[paper mill]]s or as [[boiler]] fuel. [[Energy crop]]s constitute another potentially large feedstock for thermal depolymerization.

==Current status==
Reports in 2004 claimed that the Carthage facility was selling products at 10% below the price of equivalent oil, but its production costs were low enough that it produced a profit. At the time it was paying for turkey waste (see also below).

The plant then consumed 270 tons of turkey offal (the full output of the turkey processing plant) and 20 tons of egg production waste daily. In February 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Carthage plant was producing about {{convert|400|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude oil.

In April 2005 the plant was reported to be running at a loss. Further 2005 reports summarized some economic setbacks which the Carthage plant encountered since its planning stages. It was thought that concern over mad cow disease would prevent the use of turkey waste and other animal products as cattle feed, and thus this waste would be free. As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that feed stock at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil. Final cost, as of January 2005, was $80/barrel ($1.90/gal).

The above cost of production also excludes the operating cost of the thermal oxidizer and scrubber added in May 2005 in response to odor complaints (see below).

A biofuel tax credit of roughly $1 per US gallon (26 ¢/L) on production costs was not available because the oil produced did not meet the definition of "biodiesel" according to the relevant American tax legislation. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] specifically added thermal depolymerization to a $1 renewable diesel credit, which became effective at the end of 2005, allowing a profit of $4/barrel of output oil.

===Company expansion===
The company has explored expansion in California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and is presently examining projects in Europe, where animal products cannot be used as cattle feed. TDP is also being considered as an alternative means for sewage treatment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2004-01-22-kantor_x.htm |title=Killing germs, reducing waste, making oil: TDP might be the next big thing |accessdate=2007-02-21 |last=Kantor |first=Andrew |date= 2004-01-23 |work=[[USA Today]] |quote=The City of Philadelphia currently turns a lot of its sewage sludge into landfill. (All together now: Eww.) But working with Changing World, the city is planning a TDP project to divert that sludge — and whatever pathogens are living in it — away from the land and into oil. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smell complaints===
The pilot plant in Carthage was temporarily shut down due to smell complaints. It was soon restarted when it was discovered that few of the odors were generated by the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by the Kansas City Star, April 12, 2005. The Kansas City Star website has since archived this article: [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_dispstring=(turkey-to-oil)%20AND%20date(2005) Kansas City: Search results]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plant agreed to install an enhanced thermal oxidizer and to upgrade its [[air scrubber]] system under a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ago.mo.gov/lawsuits/2005/050605rescarthage.pdf In the circuit court of Jasper country, Missouri, at Carthage]&lt;br /&gt; "The company said it has finished installation of a thermal oxidizer and upgraded odor scrubber system that were ordered as part of a consent agreement with the city and the Missouri attorney general's office." [http://www.joplinglobe.com/story.php?story_id=188739&amp;c=87 City questions RES]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plant is located only four blocks from the tourist-attracting town center, this has strained relations with the mayor and citizens of Carthage.

According to a company spokeswoman, the plant has received complaints even on days when it is not operating. She also contended that the odors may not have been produced by their facility, which is located near several other agricultural processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;"A plant spokeswoman, Julie Gelfand, tells the Pitch that repeated odor complaints have been lodged on days when the plant wasn't in operation or when wind conditions were inconsistent with the complaints." [http://www.pitch.com/Issues/2005-11-24/news/feature_4.html Fowl &amp; Crude]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2005, the plant was ordered by the state governor to shut down once again over allegations of foul odors as reported by MSNBC.&lt;ref&gt;"A foul-smelling plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil was ordered closed by the governor Wednesday until the company finds a way to clear the air." [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10636943 Turkey-oil plant closed due to foul odors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 7, 2006, the plant has begun limited test runs to validate it has resolved the odor issue.&lt;ref&gt;"An experimental plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil can resume normal operations for 15 days to test whether new equipment solves a problem with bad smells that prompted the state to shut it down in December. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/14040813.htm Kansascity.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 24, 2006, the last lawsuit connected with the odor issue has been dismissed and the problem is acknowledged as fixed.&lt;ref&gt;"The last lawsuit left from a dispute over odors from a plant that converts turkey waste into fuel oil was dismissed Thursday after the facility fixed its odor problems."
[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/business/15352930.htm Last lawsuit dropped in Carthage turkey plant odor case]&lt;/ref&gt; In late November, however, another complaint was filed over bad smells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belleville.com/mld/belleville/news/state/16029275.htm Belleville.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This complaint was closed on January 11 of 2007 with no fines assessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.mo.gov/newsrel/nr07_012.htm News Release 012 - MoDNR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status as of February 2009===
A May 2003 article in Discover magazine stated, "Appel has lined up federal grant money to help build demonstration plants to process chicken offal and manure in Alabama and crop residuals and grease in Nevada. Also in the works are plants to process turkey waste and manure in Colorado and pork and cheese waste in Italy. He says the first generation of depolymerization centers will be up and running in 2005. By then it should be clear whether the technology is as miraculous as its backers claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of August 2008, the only operational plant listed at the company's website is the initial one in Carthage, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingworldtech.com/where/index.asp Changingworldtech.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing World Technology applied for an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] on August 12; 2008, hoping to raise $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10017027-54.html?tag=nefd.top News.Cnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual [[Dutch Auction]] type IPO failed possibly because CWT has lost nearly $20 million with very little revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth2tech.com/2009/02/13/changing-world-ipo-is-a-no-go/ Earth2tech.com], changing world IPO is a no go&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN0130987720090201 UK.reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

CWT, the parent company of Renewable Energy Solutions, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. No details on plans for the Carthage plant have been released.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr''' (TSKK) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] research-institute working on issues related to the [[Konkani language]], literature, culture and education. It is based in Alto [[Porvorim]], on the outskirts of the state capital of [[Goa]], India.

==Aim==

The TSKK says it "is devoted to the promotion of education and research in the Konknni language, literature and culture". It was registered under the Societies Registration Act in 1982 and first functioned from 1986 at the locality of [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], before its current premises was built. It is located alongside the also Jesuit [[Xavier Centre of Historical Research]].

==Current status, and name==

TSKK is a Society registered under the Indian [[Societies Registration Act]] of  1860. From June 1999, it has been recognized by the [[Goa University]] as a  Konknni research institute.

This institution gets its name from the sixteenth-century English Jesuit priest, [[Thomas Stephens (missionary)|Thomas Stephens]] (1549–1619), a linguist and Marathi poet. Stephens came to Goa, then a Portuguese colony, on 24 October 1579. According to the institution, Stephens learned the Konknni and Marathi languages and wrote in them. He produced the first grammar to be produced in an Indian language, in Konknni  printed in 1622. Stephens died in Goa in 1619.

==Research bulletin==
[[File:India Goa TSKKBulletin.jpg|thumb|TSKK's Sod research bulletin]]

One of the activities of the TSKK is the publication of a research bulletin called ''Sod''. This journal is edited, produced and published as part of TSKK's "research efforts ... devoted to the promotion of education and research in (the) Konknni language, literature and culture". Its articles are a mix of Konknni written in Devanagari-script, [[Konkani in the Roman script|the Roman (Romi) script]], and occasionally in English too.

Issue No 10 April 2006 contains the following articles: 

* Konkani Myths: Pratap Naik SJ
* Social damage done by Goa's language controversy and (the) conspiracy behind it. Ramnath G Naik
* Roman script, the soul of Konknni. Nelson Lopes.
* Socio-economic growth of the Goan community through the Konkani language. Tomazinho Cardozo
* Roman script for Konkani, a must: now or never. Godfrey Gonsalves.
* Script controversy. Eduardo Faleiro.
* A response to "Konknni Myths". Alito Siqueira.
* Scripting controversy: debating the war of the Konknnis. Jason Keith Fernandes.
* An attempt to understand Konknni language assertion movement. Sammit Khandeparkar.
* Mother tongue blues. Madhavi Sardesai.

* English medium primary education for better future. Cypriano Lopes.
* Response to "English medium primary education for better future" Joe F Vaz.

Generally ''Sod'' issues are priced at Rs 50 each (in Goa).

==Courses in Konkani, etc==

TSKK also offers courses in the [[Konknni]] language, and on project methodology for researchers, and study methodology for students. Currently (September 2006), the TSKK is working on language-teaching books for adults and children to learn Konkani (in the '''Romi''' or '''Roman''' script).

==Management and location==
[[File:India Goa TSKK PratapNaik.jpg|thumb|Pratap Naik, sj, director of TSKK]]
Earlier, this institute was headed by [[Fr Mathew Almeida, sj]] who has been succeeded by [[Fr Pratap Naik sj]].

Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr is located at B.B.Borkar Road, Alto Porvorim, Goa (India) 403 521.

==Publications==

TSKK has come out with a number of publications in the [[Konknni]] language, or in languages like English introducing themes related to [[Konknni]], which is India's smallest language, spoken mainly along the west coast of this country.  

Some of its publication include a 1988 guide to writing [[Devanagari]] script [[Konknni]] (20 pp, then priced at Rs 3, now out of print), ''A Description of Konknni'' by [[Matthew Almeida, sj]] (1989), ''Teacher's and Parent's Manual'' (1996, pp 150)by Pratap Naik,S.J., ''TSKK Konknni Basic Course'' (Matthew Almeida, SJ, 1991), ''Tisvaddeacheo Igorzo'' ([[Moreno de Souza]], SJ, 1994, on the churches of the sub-district of [[Tiswadi]] in Goa), ''TSKK Romi Lipi'' (TSKK's orthography for Roman-script Konknni by Pratap Naik, SJ 2005 pp 52).

In addition it has also brought out five cassettes and CDs, of Konknni music containing devotional songs and nursery rhymes and children's songs.

==TSKK's plant collection==
[[File:India Goa TSKKgarden.jpg|thumb|TSKK's botanical garden]]

[[Jesuit]] priest [[Pratap Naik sj]], director of the TSKK currently, has been building a collection of over 328 trees and plants, all in the yard of a research institution studying the local [[Konknni]] language. Naik  argues that the culture of a place is reflected "not only" in its language, but also in its flora—apart from its fauna, architecture, food habits and dress.

He has been quoted saying that he wants to grow one of every fruit-bearing tree that grows in [[Goa]] which is rich in plant diversity. This richness is thanks in significant part to plant exchanges by the former rulers who centuries back controlled international seaways and had an empire straddling the continents.

Many months of hard work has seen Naik piece together a well-maintained and neatly labelled botanical garden. Visible are the local names in Konknni, the botanical names, their [[English language|English]] names. Elsewhere, he keeps a list of the original native countries of these [[Goa]]-adopted plants.

Among the collection are the '''ainno madd''' (the Fan Palm in [[English language|English]], or [[Livistona rotundifolia]] as it's known by its botanical name). It comes from tropical [[United States|America]].  There's the '''ambaddo''', dismissively perhaps called the [[Spondias|hog-plum]] that traces its origins to [[India]] itself. The '''ambor''' ([[mulberry]], or [[Morus alba]]) has [[China|Chinese]] origins. '''Kalljirem''' (black cumin, [[Nigella sativa]]) is again of [[India]]n origin. 

'''Kiraitem''' ([[canscora]] in English, or [[Canscora decussata]]) is from [[India]], but the '''zaifoll''' ([[nutmeg]], [[Mystica fragans]]) comes from the [[Moluccas]], the so-called [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of past centuries, in the [[Far East]]. '''Gozgo''' (the [[fever nut]] or [[Caesalpinia bonduc]]) is, again, of [[India]]n origin.

Naik says he has already found the names of 325 species from among the 329 he planted. "Some don't have names in Konknni (the local language)," he is quoted as saying, obviously because of their exotic origins.

* 28th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts describe [[electric fish]]. They refer to them as the "Thunderer of the [[Nile]]", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish.&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{citation|title=Review: Electric Fish|first=Peter|last=Moller|journal=BioScience|volume=41|issue=11|date=December 1991|pages=794–6 [794]|doi=10.2307/1311732|jstor=1311732|last2=Kramer|first2=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] observes that rubbing fur on various substances, such as [[amber]], would cause an attraction between the two, which is now known to be caused by [[static electricity]].

* 1st century BC &amp;mdash; Pliny in his Natural History records the story of a shepherd Magnes who discovered the magnetic properties of some iron stones, "''it is said, made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his staff adhered to the ground.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.dedication |author=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |chapter=Dedication|series=Perseus Collection: Greek and Roman Materials|publisher=Department of the Classics, Tufts University |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 130 AD. &amp;mdash; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (in his work ''Optics'') wrote about the properties of [[light]] including: [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[color]] and tabulated [[angle]]s of [[refraction]] for several media

* 14th century AD &amp;mdash; Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of [[lightning]], and [[electricity]] from any other source, is to be attributed to the [[Arabs]], who before the 15th century had the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for lightning (''raad'') applied to the [[electric ray]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana"&gt;''The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]; a library of universal knowledge'' (1918), [[New York City|New York]]: Encyclopedia Americana Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1550 &amp;mdash; [[Gerolamo Cardano]] writes about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th century==
* 1600 &amp;mdash; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] publishes ''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure'' ("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic potential]], was named in his honor.

* 1705 &amp;mdash; [[Francis Hauksbee (scientist)|Francis Hauksbee]] improves von Guericke's [[electrostatic generator]] by using a glass globe and generates the first sparks by approaching his finger to the rubbed globe.
* 1728 &amp;mdash; [[James Bradley]] discovers the [[Aberration of light|aberration]] of starlight and uses it to determine that the [[speed of light]] is about 283,000 [[kilometre|km]]/[[second|s]]

This has been described as the beginning of electrical communication.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=David H.|last2=Clark|first2=Stephen P.H.|title=Newton's tyranny : the suppressed scientific discoveries of Stephen Gray and John Flamsteed|date=2001|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716747017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} This was also the first distinction between the roles of conductors and insulators (names applied by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]], mathematician and [[Royal Society]] member, who stated that Gray "has made greater variety of electrical experiments than all the philosophers of this and the last age.")&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} Georges-Louis LeSage built a [[electrical telegraph|static electricity telegraph]] in 1774, based upon the same principles discovered by Gray.
* 1732 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,'' describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous," produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous," by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{fact|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &amp;mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &amp;mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &amp;mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &amp;mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[Light#Wave_theor|wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced [[light]] and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &amp;mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines. The receiving charged end was to electrostatically attract a disc of paper marked with the corresponding letter.
* 1767 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Priestley]] proposes an electrical inverse-square law
* 1774 &amp;mdash; [[Georges-Louis LeSage]] builds an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires conducting Leyden-jar charges to pith-ball electroscopes, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. Its range was only between rooms of his home.
* 1784 &amp;mdash; [[Henry Cavendish]] defines the [[electromagnetic induction|inductive capacity]] of [[dielectrics]] (insulators) and measures the specific inductive capacity of various substances by comparison with an air condenser.
* 1785 &amp;mdash; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Charles Coulomb]] introduces the [[Coulomb's law|inverse-square law of electrostatics]]
* 1786 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers "animal electricity" and postulates that animal bodies are storehouses of electricity. His invention of the voltaic cell leads to the invention the electric battery.
* 1791 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII.

* 1799 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries," regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[William Herschel]] discovers [[infrared radiation]] from the Sun.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Anthony Carlisle]] and [[Johann Ritter]] use electricity to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, thereby discovering the process of [[electrolysis]], which led to the discovery of many other elements.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]] invents the [[voltaic pile]], or "battery", specifically to disprove Galvani's animal electricity theory.

==19th century==

===1801-1850===
* 1801 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Johann Ritter]] discovers [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun
* 1801 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] demonstrates the [[wave nature]] of light and the principle of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]
* 1802 &amp;mdash; [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], Italian legal scholar, discovers that electricity and magnetism are related by noting that a nearby voltaic pile deflects a magnetic needle. He published his account in an Italian newspaper, but this was overlooked by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Roberto de Andrade|chapter=Romagnosi and Volta’s pile: early difficulties in the interpretation of Voltaic electricity|editor-last1=Bevilacqua|editor-first1=Fabio|editor-last2=Fregonese|editor-first2=Lucio|title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times|location=
Pavia |publisher=Ulrico Hoepli |volume=3 |pages=81–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1803 &amp;mdash; Thomas Young develops the [[Double-slit experiment]] and demonstrates the effect of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]].
* 1806 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]] employs a voltaic pile to decompose potash and soda, showing that they are the oxides of the previously unknown metals potassium and sodium. These experiments were the beginning of [[electrochemistry]].
* 1808 &amp;mdash; [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] discovers [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] by reflection
* 1809 &amp;mdash; Étienne-Louis Malus publishes the law of Malus which predicts the light intensity transmitted by two polarizing sheets
* 1809 &amp;mdash; [[Humphry Davy]] first publicly demonstrates the electric [[arc lamp|arc light]].
* 1811 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] discovers that some quartz crystals continuously rotate the electric vector of light
* 1816 &amp;mdash; [[David Brewster]] discovers stress [[birefringence]]
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[Siméon Poisson]] predicts the [[Arago spot|Poisson-Arago bright spot]] at the center of the shadow of a circular opaque obstacle
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] verifies the existence of the Poisson-Arago  bright spot
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, a short time after learning of Ørsted's discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, conducts experiments and publishes a paper in ''[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]'' attempting to give a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]] announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovers the [[thermoelectric effect]].
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &amp;mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1829 &amp; 1830 &amp;mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &amp;mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[Electrochemical_equivalent#Electrochemical_equivalents|electrochemical equivalents]]
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon’s design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.
[[File:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|180px|Chart of the [[Morse code]] letters and numerals.]]
* 1836 &amp;mdash; [[David Alter|Dr. David Alter]] invents and demonstrates to witnesses the first American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania. In a later interview in the book, ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties'' he states: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph." In '''1840''' he invents an electric buggy, forerunner of the automobile. His inventions also include an electric clock and a short-range type of telephone, forerunner to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He is also credited with the origins of Spectrum Analysis by his idea that every element has its own emission spectrum, and an expansion of spectrum analysis to include the optical properties of gases.
* 1837 &amp;mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"
* 1838 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] uses Volta's battery to discover [[cathode ray]]s.
* 1839 &amp;mdash; [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] observes the [[photoelectric effect]] with an electrode in a conductive solution exposed to light.
* 1840 &amp;mdash; [[James Prescott Joule]] formulates [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
* 1845 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [[magnetic field]]s ([[Faraday effect]])
* 1849 &amp;mdash; [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Jean-Bernard Foucault]] measure the speed of light to be about 298,000&amp;nbsp;km/s

* 1861 &amp;mdash; the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|first transcontinental telegraph system]] spans North America by connecting an existing network in the eastern United States to a small network in California by a link between Omaha and Carson City via Salt Lake City. The slower Pony Express system ceased operation a month later.
* 1864 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his papers on a dynamical theory of the [[electromagnetic field]]
* 1865 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&amp;nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in lab conditions, Edison concentrated on commercial application and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.
* 1879 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Stefan|Jožef Stefan]] discovers the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law|Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law]] of a [[black body]] and uses it to calculate the first sensible value of the temperature of the Sun's surface to be 5700 [[Kelvin|K]]

* 1888 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz|Heinrich Hertz]] demonstrates the existence of electromagnetic waves by building an apparatus that produced and detected UHF radio waves (or microwaves in the UHF region). He also found that radio waves could be transmitted through different types of materials and were reflected by others, the key to [[radar]].

* 1905 &amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] proposes the [[Special Relativity|Theory of Special Relativity]], in which he rejects the existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts ''as a [[postulate]]'' that the speed of light is constant in all [[inertial|inertial frames of reference]], and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [[time dilation]], [[length contraction]], the [[relativity of simultaneity]], the [[relativistic mass|dependence of mass on velocity]], and the [[mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].
* 1905 &amp;mdash; Einstein explains the [[photoelectric effect]] by extending Planck's idea of light quanta, or [[photons]], to the absorption and emission of [[photoelectrons]].  Einstein would later receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery, which launched the [[quantum mechanics|quantum revolution]] in physics.
* 1911 &amp;mdash; [[Superconductivity]] is discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was studying the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently discovered liquid helium as a refrigerant.

==History and culture==

===Etymology and usage===
The term ''tribadism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word τριβάς (''tribas''), meaning "a woman who practices unnatural vice with herself or with other women",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriba%2Fs τριβάς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the verb τρίβω (''tribō''), "rub".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtri%2Fbw τρίβω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greek and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], a tribas, or tribade (IPA:{{IPA|/ˈtrɪbəd/ /tribad/}}),&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd.

In English texts, ''tribade'' is recorded as early as 1601, in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Praeludium'' (Poem X in ''The Forest''),&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; to as late as the mid-nineteenth century; it was the most common lesbian term in European texts,&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; through the proliferation of classical literature, anatomies, midwiferies, sexual advice manuals, and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; It also came to refer to lesbian sexual practices in general, though anatomical investigation in the mid-eighteenth century led to skepticism about stories of enlarged clitorises and anatomists and doctors argued for a more precise distinction between clitoral [[hypertrophy]] and [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;

Author Bonnie Zimmerman stated, "More often, however, [European] writers avoided the term, instead euphemistically invoking 'unnatural vice,' 'lewd behavior,' 'crimes against nature,' 'using an instrument,' and 'taking the part of a man.'{{-"}}&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; In the eighteenth century, where the term saw one of its most popular uses, it was employed in several pornographic [[Defamation|libels]] against [[Marie Antoinette]], who was "tried and roundly convicted in the press" as being a tribade.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; "[Her] rumored tribadism had historically specific political implications," stated author Dena Goodman. "Consider her final (fictive) testimony in ''The Confession of Marie-Antoinette'': 'People!' she protests, 'because I ceded to the sweet impressions of nature, and in imitating the charming weakness of all the women of the court of France, I surrendered to the sweet impulsion of love...you hold me, as it were, captive within your walls?'" Goodman elaborated that in one libel, Marie-Antoinette is described as generously providing details of her husband's "incapacity in the venereal act" and that her lust resulted in her taking an aristocratic beauty [[Yolande de Polastron]], the Duchess of Polignac (1749-1793), "into [her] service" and later specifying that what makes sex with a woman so appealing is "Adroit in the art of stimulating the clitoris"; Marie-Antoinette is described as having stated that La Polignac's attentions produced "one of those rare pleasures that cannot be used up because it can be repeated as many times as one likes".&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

By the time the [[Victorian era]] arrived, cited Zimmerman, "tribadism tended to be constructed as a lower class and non-Western phenomenon and often was associated with the supposed degeneration of prostitutes and criminals".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; By the twentieth century, "''tribade'' had been supplanted" by the terms ''[[sappho|sapphist]]'', ''lesbian'', ''invert'', and ''homosexual'', as ''tribade'' had become too archaic to use.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; ''Fricatrice'', a synonym for ''tribade'' that also refers to rubbing but has a Latin rather than a Greek root, appeared in English texts as early as 1605 (in Ben Jonson's ''[[Volpone]]'').&lt;ref name="Andreadis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andreadis |first=Harriette |title=Sappho in Early Modern England: Female Same-Sex Literary Erotics, 1550–1714|publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |pages=41, 49–51|isbn=0-226-02009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage suggests that it was more colloquial and more [[pejorative]] than ''tribade''.&lt;ref name="Andreadis"/&gt; Variants include the Latinized ''confricatrice'' and English ''rubster''.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreadis"/&gt;

Some lesbian and bisexual women do not engage in the scissoring position, because they find it physically uncomfortable, feel that it is not representative of [[lesbian sexual practices]] and is more attributable to the male fantasies of the heterosexual [[Sex industry|porn industry]], or because they otherwise have not included it as part of their sex lives.&lt;ref name="thefrisky.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Dowling|title=Girl On Girl: 11 Misconceptions About Lesbians|date=December 4, 2009|accessdate=December 29, 2010|publisher=TheFrisky.com|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-12-04/girl-on-girl-11-misconceptions-about-lesbians/ |work=[[The Frisky (website)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afterellen.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mia|last=Jones|title=All lesbians are good at sports, and other misconceptions|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=December 29, 2010|publisher=[[AfterEllen.com and TheBacklot.com|AfterEllen.com]]|url=http://www.afterellen.com/all-lesbians-are-good-at-sports-and-other-misconceptions/12/2009/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite web|first=Amanda|last=Hess|title=Lesbians Don't Scissor Edition|date=November 24, 2009|accessdate=December 29, 2010|publisher=[[Washington City Paper]]|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2009/11/24/university-sex-columns-reviewed-lesbians-dont-scissor-edition/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parello"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jennifer|last=Parello|title=Scissor Sex|date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2013|publisher=''[[Lavender (magazine)|Lavender]]''|url=http://www.lavendermagazine.com/our-lives/scissor-sex/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Raw Story]]'' states, "Whether [the scissoring position] describes a traditional or even common lesbian act remains up for debate."&lt;ref name="Carpentier"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sarah Silverman offers to ‘scissor' Sheldon Adelson for Obama|publisher=''[[The Raw Story]]''|date= July 16, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/07/16/sarah-silverman-offers-to-scissor-sheldon-adelson-for-obama/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources, however, such as [[Shere Hite]]'s 1976 and 1981 research, show that women may enjoy performing the scissoring position with other women because it is a variation of vulva-to-vulva contact or can allow for maximum vulva-to-vulva contact and therefore an elevated level of intimacy.&lt;ref name="Hite, Tribadism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schell"/&gt;

Garnets |isbn = 978-1-4051-0080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Halberstam]], in her book ''Female Masculinity'', stated, "If we trace the use of the term forward into present, we find that tribadism is one of those rarely discussed but often practiced sexual activities, and the silence that surrounds it now is as puzzling as the discourse it produced in earlier centuries." She added that [[Sigmund Freud]] "had nothing to say" with regard to the topic, "and few contemporary lesbian sex books even discuss it".&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt;

According to older studies, "approximately one-third of lesbian women used tribadism, or body contact, as a means of achieving orgasm (Saghir &amp; Robins, 1973; Jay &amp; Young, 1977)".&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt; [[Masters and Johnson]]'s 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices found that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare, and that lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) "was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado" and "[w]hen asked what techniques they used in their last 10 lovemaking sessions, 100% were for kissing, sucking on nipples, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported tribadism".&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women from a community sample; the study reported that 85% of the women engaged in tribadism (whether genital-to-genital contact or rubbing genitals against another part of a partner's body), and, like older studies, that vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among women who have sex with women is rare.&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual behaviour of lesbians and bisexual women|author1=J V Bailey |author2=C Farquhar |author3=C Owen |author4=D Whittaker |journal=[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]|volume=79|issue=2|date=April 2003|pmid=12690139|doi=10.1136/sti.79.2.147|pages=147–150|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744617/pdf/v079p00147.pdf|pmc=1744617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safe sex====
As with any exchange of [[body fluid]]s during sexual activities, genital-to-genital tribadism has the potential to transfer [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs) if those are present in one or more of the partners. [[AIDS.gov]] and the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] state that genital-genital and genital-body contact (including tribadism) can spread STIs such as [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]], [[Crab louse|pubic lice]] (crabs) and [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] and that "wearing clothes and for herpes, avoiding contact if sores are present, reduces the risks".&lt;ref name="aids.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Risk Factors|publisher=[[AIDS.gov]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|url=http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/sexual-risk-factors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Publichealth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexually Transmitted Disease Program – Resources for Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Women

===Popular culture and other media===
Tribadism has been referenced in various aspects of popular culture. The [[glam rock|glam]] [[Pop music|pop]] band [[Scissor Sisters]] derived their name from the scissoring position.&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Scissor Sisters: On the Cutting Edge |first=Richard |last=Harrington |periodical=[[Washington Post]] |date=January 7, 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53256-2005Jan6.html |accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford, Alex (2005).

Genital-genital tribadism was depicted three times during the "[[D-Yikes!]]" episode of the cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', referred to in the episode as ''scissoring''. The episode is credited with having brought more recognition to the act of scissoring,&lt;ref name=thefrisky.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; with ''[[The Raw Story]]'' stating, "Though the band 'Scissor Sisters' takes its name from descriptions of the act, it wasn't until scissoring was dramatized in the 2007 'South Park' episode 'D-Yikes' that it achieved wide recognition in mainstream culture."&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; The term additionally received mainstream recognition after the episode "[[Duets (Glee)|Duets]]" of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' had characters [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce|Brittany S.

In 2010, in response to [[California State University, Long Beach]] refusing to advertise the play "The Night of the Tribades" on the Seventh Street marquee because of the word ''tribades'' in its title, approximately 24 theater arts majors protested in front of Brotman Hall by simulating tribadism (including scissoring). "When you put tribade into a Google search image, apparently it comes up with the word tribadism, which is a sex act and they decided it was inappropriate," stated one student.&lt;ref name="Rivera"/&gt;

Tribadism and other lesbian sex scenes are featured in the 2013 film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]].'' The scenes were the subject of debate among lesbians and critics, with the depiction of scissoring being one of the acts that were criticized; in an interview surveying a small panel of lesbian women, one of the women, who was skeptical that lesbian sexual activity included scissoring at all, seemed more open to the idea of a [[Woman on top#Reverse cowgirl position|reverse cowgirl position]] of scissoring; another woman had engaged in the reverse cowgirl position of scissoring.&lt;ref name="Saraiya"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sonia|last=Saraiya|title=Lesbians have some thoughts about the sex scenes in Blue Is The Warmest Color |date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013|publisher=''[[The A.V.

Female-female genital sex is not exclusive to humans. Females of the [[bonobo]] species, found in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], also engage in this act, usually referred to by [[Primatology|primatologists]] as ''GG rubbing'' (genital-to-genital).&lt;ref name="songweaver"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Waal|first=Frans|authorlink=Frans de Waal|title=Bonobo sex and society|publisher=''[[Scientific American]]''|volume=272 |issue=3 |pages=82–8 |date=Mar 1995 |pmid=7871411 |url=http://songweaver.com/info/bonobos.html|format=reprint|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0395-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paoli T, Palagi E, Tacconi G, Tarli SB |title=Perineal swelling, intermenstrual cycle, and female sexual behavior in bonobos (Pan paniscus) |journal=Am J Primatol |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=333–47 |date=Apr 2006 |pmid=16534808 |doi=10.1002/ajp.20228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps the bonobo's most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate, is genito-genital rubbing (or GG rubbing) between adult females," stated primatologist [[Frans de Waal]]. "One female facing another clings with arms and legs to a partner that, standing on both hands and feet, lifts her off the ground."&lt;ref name="songweaver"/&gt;

In bonobos, the clitoris is larger and more externalized than in most mammals.&lt;ref name="Balcombe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Balcombe|first=Jonathan Peter|authorlink=Jonathan Balcombe|title = The Exultant Ark: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure | publisher = [[University of California Press]]|isbn = 0520260244|year =2011|page=88|accessdate = November 22, 2012 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=tz9mSyTWh0oC&amp;pg=PA88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethology|Ethologist]] [[Jonathan Balcombe]] states that bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, "which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement"; on average, female bonobos engage in genital-genital rubbing "about once every two hours".&lt;ref name="Balcombe"/&gt;
