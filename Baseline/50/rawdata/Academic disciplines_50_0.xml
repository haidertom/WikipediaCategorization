[[File:Airquotes.gif|thumbnail|right|The index and middle finger are lowered twice.]]

'''Air quotes''', also called '''finger quotes''', are virtual [[quotation marks]] formed in the air with one's fingers when speaking. This is typically done with hands held shoulder-width apart and at the eye level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing at the beginning and end of the phrase being quoted.&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/air-quotes.html |title=Air quotes |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081103020926/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/air-quotes.html| archivedate= 3 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air-quoted phrase is—in the most common usage—very short, at most a few words.  Air quotes are often used to express [[satire]], [[sarcasm]], [[irony]] or [[euphemism]], among others, and are analogous to [[scare quotes]] in print.

Use of similar gestures has been recorded as early as 1927&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder" /&gt;, and Glenda Farrell used air quotes in a 1937 screwball comedy, "Breakfast for Two." (Much earlier, in 1889, Lewis Carroll described similar usages -- air brackets and an air question mark -- in his last novel, &lt;ref&gt;''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', vol.I, ch.17: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/620/620-0.txt «he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his finger» and «what can be simpler than just to make a “?” in the air with your finger?»].&lt;/ref&gt;). The term "air quotes" first appeared in a 1989 [[Spy (magazine)|''Spy'' magazine]] article by [[Paul Rudnick]] and [[Kurt Andersen]], who state it became a common gesture around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudnick|first1=Paul|title=The Irony Epidemic|work=Spy Magazine|date=March 1989|page=93-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gesture was used routinely in the TV show ''[[Celebrity Charades]]'' (1979) as the standard signal for a quote or phrase.
In the episode "Nurse's Wild" of TV show ''[[Emergency!]]'' (1972), the character Roy DeSoto uses air quotes at Rampart Hospital base station.

The trend became very popular in the 1990s, attributed by many to comedian [[Steve Martin]], who often used them with exaggerated emphasis in his stand-up shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Additionally, in the blockbuster ''[[Austin Powers (series)|Austin Powers]]'' film series, [[Dr. Evil]] makes exaggerated use of air quotes when explaining matters to his henchmen, particularly while using real phrases he erroneously believes himself to have coined such as "[[laser]]" and "[[Death Star]]".

In the [[HBO]] special [[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|''Back in Town'']] from 1996, the stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] satirized the use of air quotes in the skit "Quote Marks in the Air" from the segment "Free-Floating Hostility".

'''''Alltagsgeschichte''''' is a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s. It was founded by historians [[Alf Luedtke]] and [[:de:Hans Medick|Hans Medick]].

The name comes from German, where ''Alltag'' means "everyday life"; it can thus be roughly translated as "everyday history". In this sense, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can be considered part of the wider Marxian historical school of '[[People's history|history from below]]'. 

The purpose of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' is to find and prove the links between the down-to-earth, everyday, basic experiences of ordinary people in a society, and the broad social and political changes which occur in that society. Because this is such a massively broad endeavour to undertake, it can only feasibly be practised on the most minute of scales. Thus ''Alltagsgeschichte'' becomes a form of microhistory.

Its leading exponents include [[Paul Veyne]] and Michel Rouche in France, and Peter Carr in the United Kingdom. ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can also be linked to the Italian historical doctrine of ''Microstoria'' (microhistory).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">The '''American Association of Public Health Dentistry''' (AAPHD), founded in 1937, focuses upon addressing the public health challenges to oral health at the population level. Its open membership for everyone who seeks improvement in oral health of the general public. supports developing and supporting effective programs of oral health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/ Home page for the American Association of Public Health Dentistry (AAPHD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/abdph American Board of Dental Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is headquartered in [[Springfield, Illinois]].

== Mission ==
[[Public health]] dentistry is defined as by [[TheFreeDictionary.com]] as "that specialty of dentistry concerned with the prevention and control of dental diseases and promotion of oral health through organized community efforts."

== Organization ==

The American Association of Public Health Dentistry was founded in 1937.  AAPHD publishes a newsletter for AAPHD members and a journal, the Journal of Public Health Dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1752-7325 Journal of Public Health Dentistry. Wiley Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  It offers online continuing education courses for public health dentists in oral health literacy, dental public health policy and advocacy, and professional dental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/online-dental-public-health-courses Dental Public Health online courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2014, Julie Frantsve-Hawley, PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Genetics, Biological and Biomedical Sciences program, Harvard University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; has been the Executive Director of AAPHD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-frantsve-hawley-b376b631/ LinkedIn article for Julie Frantsve-Hawley, PhD]&lt;/ref&gt;  She had been with [[American Dental Association]] before and had edited journals in [[evidence-based dentistry]].

Each year it plans a National Oral Health Conference® (NOHC) in the United States, which next will be held from April 16–18, 2018 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NationalOralHealthConference.com AAPHD's NOHC Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeo-optics''', or '''archaeological optics''', is the study of the experience and ritual use of light by ancient peoples. Archaeological [[optics]] is a branch of sensory archaeology, which explores human perceptions of the physical environment in the remote past, and is a sibling of [[archaeoastronomy]], which deals with ancient observations of celestial bodies, and archaeological acoustics, which deals with applications of sound.

Research by several investigators around the world has uncovered how ancient peoples encountered and used the [[camera obscura]] principle for a variety of purposes. In a darkened chamber, light passing through a small opening can create haunting and ephemeral moving images, which could have triggered and reinforced ground breaking modes of thought, forms of representation, and belief in otherworldly realms.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Assimina Kaniari and Marina Wallace, eds.) London: Zidane. 153.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical basis==

=== Light ===
Visible [[light]], a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, encompasses wavelengths between 380-750 nanometers, which humans perceive as the colors of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Light behaves according to a well-defined set of rules: it travels in straight lines, unless otherwise refracted or reflected by another object, or curved by gravity.

=== Vision ===
An [[eye]] is essentially a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;Explanation of camera obscura operations derived from Pollack, P. (1969). The Picture History of Photography: From the Earliest Beginnings to the Present Day. New York: Harry N. Abrams. 18.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an inverted image is known as a [[camera obscura]] (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years ago on a sea mollusk, known as a [[Nautilus#Senses|nautilus]], during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved to take advantage of it.

=== Camera obscura ===
The camera obscura principle is not limited to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, soda cans, cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, H. and Gernsheim, A. (1969). The History of Photography: From the Camera Obscura to the Beginning of the Modern Era. New York: McGraw-Hill. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition into the rain forest of Costa Rica where he climbed into the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, D. (1988). Life above the Jungle Floor. New York: Simon and Schuster. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of experience is available across time.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, E. (2004). Pinhole Photography: Rediscovering a Historic Technique (3rd ed). Oxford: Focal Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image created appears like an upside-down movie. A camera obscura relies on the contrast between the bright exterior world and a dim interior space, so that a greater contrast produces a more obvious projected image. Absolute darkness in the interior is not necessary, but there must be a significant difference between the two illumination levels.

==Archaeological basis==

=== Architecture ===
The archaeological record is replete with excavations of built structures across time, but due to the natural decay of materials and the vagaries of preservation, the further backward in time, the less likely it is for artifacts to have survived. For example, [[Paleolithic]] shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;For a good overview of Palaeolithic dwellings structures and strategies see Cattelain, P. and Hauzeur, A. (1998). “Des premiers abris aux premières maisons.” In Les grandes inventions de la Préhistoire (Bellier C. and Cattelain, P. eds.) (Guides archéologiques du Malgré-Tout) Treignes: CEDARC. 37-46; and De Beaune, S. (2012). “Aux origins de la construction.” In Édifice et Artifice (R. Carvais, A. Guillerme, V. Nègre, J. Sakarovitch, eds.) Premier Congrès francophone d’histoire de la construction Paris, 2008  Paris: Piccard. 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, some [[Neolithic]] structures retain above ground elements. The Neolithic saw the rise of agriculture and the establishment of settlements, which produced a surplus of foodstuffs and an increase in population density. A large, coordinated labor force enabled the process of hauling enormous stones to build large, permanent structures. By about 5000 BP, many groups of people over a widespread area were erecting large timbers and stones, or megaliths, to enclose communal spaces. Into historical times, the development of writing offered another layer of information, with descriptions of the physical appearance, materials, design, use, and events related to structures. This combination of remnants and records enhances the accuracy of archaeo-optical analysis.

=== Archaeological optics and archaeoastronomy ===
There is some evidence that prehistorical structures oriented upon the sun's position on the horizon also created camera obscura situations. Examples in Western Europe include midwinter sunrise at [[Newgrange]],&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson. 117, 123-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  midwinter sunset at [[Maeshowe]],&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, E.W. (1997). “Maeshowe and the Winter Solstice: ceremonial aspects of the Orkney Grooved Ware culture.” Antiquity 71. 338-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and midsummer sunrise at [[Bryn Celli Ddu]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, S. (2010). “Bryn Celli Ddu Passage Tomb, Anglesey: Alignment, Construction, Date and Ritual.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 76. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

While archaeoastronomical studies have traditionally discussed these kinds of monument as observatories, fieldwork conducted in the 1990s at [[Clava cairn|Balnuaran]] of Clava by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips suggests the midwinter sunset would have cast images inside two [[Passage Tombs|passage tombs]]. By temporarily reconstructing the collapsed roofs of these monuments, they noted that the act of viewing the sun along their passageways was not only potentially blinding but could only be clearly viewed by one person at a time. In contrast, an audience of over twenty people could stand with their backs to the opening to observe the effects of sunlight falling upon deliberately patterned stonework built into walls of both chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” Current Archaeology 165. 332-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations inspired Scott to speculate that these structures were camera obscuras, and that an optical projection of the sun’s disc would reproduce the movements of the sun through the sky for many people to see at once.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological optics and the archaeology of the senses ===
Archaeological optics contributes to a wider discipline, the archaeology of the senses. Rather than just recording the remains of the past such as standing stones or built walls, this wider discipline emphasizes how the spaces in-between these features could have been arenas for sensory experiences, even if parts of the original structures have disappeared. Among the senses, vision has been a major consideration, including studies of visibility between sites,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, A.B.  and Woodwood, P.J. (1996). “The topography of some barrow cemeteries in Bronze Age Wessex.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 62. 275-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  interactions with geology and topography,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (1998). Ruined buildings, ruined stones: enclosures, tombs and natural places in the Neolithic of south-west England. World Archaeology 30. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeoastronomical alignment,&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  or color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. and MacGregor, G., eds. (2002). Colouring the past: the significance of colour in archaeological research. London: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, anthropology has revealed societies that emphasize the other senses&lt;ref&gt;Howes, D. and Classen, C., eds. (1991). The varieties of sensory experience. London: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  including qualities such as scent and smell.&lt;ref&gt;Classen, C., Howes, D., and Synnott, A. (1994). Aroma: the cultural history of smell. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  The social significance of the sensory of food and drink,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilakis, Y. (1999). “Food technologies/technologies of the body: the social context of wine and oil production and consumption in Bronze Age Crete.” In World Archaeology 31(1). 38-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  and touch and texture&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, V. (2002). “Experiencing texture and transformation in the British Neolithic.”In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 21(3). 249-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  can also be considered.

Other studies have examined archaeomusicology and archaeoacoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C and Lawson, G., eds. (2006). Archaeoacoustics. Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palaeolithic bone artifacts have been interpreted as musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, J.V.S. (1960). “Penny whistles and prehistory.” Antiquity 34, 6-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  or ‘sound producing devices’,&lt;ref&gt;Lund. C. (1981). “The archaeomusicology of Scandinavia.” In World Archaeology 12. 246-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  while some natural features within caves have been found to emit unusual sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Dams, L. (1984). “Preliminary findings at the ‘Organ’ Sanctuary in the cave of Nerja, Malaga, Spain.” In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 3. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been suggestions that Paleolithic cave art clusters in locations where caverns have especially resonant properties.&lt;ref&gt;Reznikoff, I. and Dauvois, M. (1988). “La dimension sonore des grottes ornées.” In Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française 85. 238-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s the sonic properties of built architecture came under increasing scrutiny with investigations into vocally induced resonances inside chambered Neolithic sites,&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, P. and Jahn, R (1996). “Preliminary investigations and cognitive considerations of the acoustical resonances of selected archaeological sites.” In Antiquity 70. 665-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the wider acoustic phenomenon within a variety of megalithic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Keating. D. (1999). “Architecture and sound: an acoustic analysis of megalithic monuments in prehistoric Britain.” In Antiquity 73. 325-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

An archaeology of the senses, including archaeological optics, emphasizes that the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This acknowledges that the senses were likely to have been used and understood in very different ways by people through time.

==Development of the field of archaeological optics==

The study of ancient perceptions of light developed from many disparate sources — archaeologists, artists, antiquarians, and astronomers  — with precursors reaching back at least a millennium. In 1998, archaeologist Ronnie Scott speculated that Neolithic [[Passage grave|passage tombs]] in Scotland might have been used as camera obscuras.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Robert Temple published an investigation into [[Nimrud lens|crystal lenses]] that date to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, R. (2000). The Crystal Sun: The Most Secret Science of the Ancient World. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeo-optics, as yet unnamed, arose as a formal line of inquiry beginning in 2005, with a presentation by Matt Gatton and his colleagues of “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art” at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. They made subsequent presentations at the University of Lisbon in 2006, and Archaeology Institute at Oxford University in 2007. A small number of researchers independently began to undertake archaeological optics fieldwork at Neolithic passage tombs. In 2011, Morgan Saletta published a paper noting camera obscura projections at two sites in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 364-73.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2011, Gatton began documenting optical projections at sites in Denmark. Aaron Watson, in collaboration with Ronnie Scott, began to record the archaeo-optic properties of monuments in Scotland in 2012, and Wales in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos. C. and Moyes, H., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the concept of archaeological optics as a broader academic field has coalesced with Constantinos Papadopoulos and Holley Moyes’s planning of the Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology, which brought researchers working along similar lines into contact.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos. C. and Moyes, H., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palaeolithic archaeological optics==

=== Paleolithic structures ===
The Lower Paleolithic was a time of early humans such as [[Homo habilis]] and [[Homo erectus]]. Possible indications of the early development of shelter construction during the Lower Paleolithic come from excavations at [[Olduvai Gorge]],&lt;ref&gt;Leakey, M.D. (1971). Olduvai Gorge, Volume 3: Excavations in beds I &amp; II 1960–1963. New York: Cambridge University Press. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Melka Kunturé,&lt;ref&gt;Chavaillon, J.

The Middle Paleolithic saw Homo erectus decline as [[Homo neanderthalensis]] developed in Eurasia, and [[Homo sapiens]] developed in Africa. Possible evidence of shelter construction in the Middle Paleolithic can be found at sites such as Port-Pignot,&lt;ref&gt;Michel, D.

The Upper Paleolithic saw the expansion of Homo sapiens and the dwindling and ultimate extinction of Homo neanderthalensis. The best examples of Upper Paleolithic shelter practices come from excavations at such places as Kostienki,&lt;ref&gt;Sinitsyn, A. (2007). “Variabilité du Gravettien de Kostienki (Bassin moyen du Don) et des territoires associés.” In Paléo, 19. 181-201; Hoffecker, J., Holliday, V., Anikovich, M.V., Sinitsyn, A.A. and Popov, V.V.

====Taphonomy====

The actual physical evidence of Paleolithic shelters is limited to permanent materials like stone and bone. No wooden post or animal hide has been found, because these materials disintegrate over the course of time. But the existence of the perishable elements can be established. Postholes prove the existence of the wooden supports. The alignment of the holes or a circle of support stones describes a footprint of a framework. The area covered by flint scattered from blade work, and other household activities, further demarcates the interior shape of the structure.

The types of stones, bones, and minerals found at the campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found around the fire pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there are a host of ethnographic parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until the onset of the modern era.

====Lifeways====
The people of the Paleolithic existed prior to agriculture and the domestication of animals, and they would have lived as small bands of [[hunter-gatherers]], moving from place to place, exploiting plant, animal, and mineral resources. Two of the factors that influenced choice of location were proximity to fresh water and animal migration routes.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P.G. (1985). Pyrenean Prehistory: A Palaeoeconomic Survey of the French Sites. Warminster: Aris &amp; Phillips. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paleolithic foragers would also set up camp overlooking fields inhabited by herds of hoofed herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, D. (1987). The Field Guide to Early Man. New York: Diagram Group. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleolithic campsites were characterized by repeated, seasonal, short-term occupation. While the inhabitants were quite mobile, without beasts of burden, shelters were not transported. A tent might stand at its location for a few years before it deteriorated and had to be rebuilt. The archaeological record describes shelters rebuilt over-and-over on roughly the same spot. Bands of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers followed an annual circuit with shelters built at strategic points along the way.

====Hearths====
Paleolithic campsites were dotted with external fire pits and internal hearths. The internal hearths were not open-burning fires, but were hollow areas that held heated stones and charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D. and Bullinger, J. (2012). “Identifying dwellings in Upper Palaeolithic open-air sites: The Magdalenian site at Monruz (Switzerland) and its contribution to analysing palimpsest.” In A Mind Set on Flint: Studies in Honour of Dick Stapert (Niekus, M., Barton, N., Street, M., Terberger, T., eds.)

Hot stones and charcoals would be rolled, with sticks or bones, onto a thick animal hide and conveyed a couple of meters from the fire pit to the hearth. The next day the task would be repeated: hearths were taken apart and reassembled routinely. Frequent heating caused the rocks to discolor and crumble. Once a rock was no longer effective at holding heat, it was thrown in a nearby refuse pit along with animal bones and other household waste. An internal stone hearth is an effective strategy for staying warm, but it did not provide any light.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D., and Bullinger, J.

Groningen Archaeological Studies, Vol. 16. Groningen: Barkhuis. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interiors of the tents were then dim places, where ancient people would have witnessed the camera obscura effect.

=== Paleolithic archaeological optics ===
Paleolithic archaeological optics involves investigations into the image projection capacities of Paleolithic tent reconstructions.

====Reconstructions====
The suitability of Paleolithic tents/shelters for coincidental camera obscura formation was explored during a set of experiments under the direction of Matt Gatton in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first set of experiments took place on a bison ranch in Oldham County, Kentucky, where a small, rudimentary bison hide [[teepee]] was erected next to a pasture, and images of the bison were cast through a hole in the hides and projected into the tent. The second set of experiments occurred at a rock shelter outside of Irvine, Estill County, Kentucky, where the investigators leaned a framework of tree branches against a rock wall and covered it with bison hides. The image of a horse outside was projected through a rough hole in the hides and into the interior space. The third set of experiments took place at the Musée du Malgré-Tout in Belgium, where archaeologists Pierre Cattelain and Claire Bellier reconstructed a variety of Paleolithic structures in several places in France, Germany and Ukraine. A smattering of holes was present in the hide coverings of each tent. At the German site, images were projected inside the reconstruction onto a rabbit hide.

====Statistical analysis====
The tent reconstructions established some plausibility of accidental camera obscura formation during the Paleolithic, but plausibility is not probability, so the question of the probable frequency of projected images was explored by [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] statistical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 181-190 Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2012). “Projecting Projection: A statistical analysis of cast-light images.” In Pleistocene Coalition Newsletter #18.&lt;/ref&gt;

To evaluate the probability of an unknown event a series of conditional probabilities were used to create a chance tree using [https://www.treeage.com/products/ TreeAge Pro 2011] (Williamstown, MA). The conditions affecting the appearance of projected images are the general context of the shelter, aperture existence, aperture size, sunlight exposure, weather, occupancy, and the specific context of the dwelling. Given the different situations regarding variables; the probability of a person observing a projected image inside a Palaeolithic dwelling ranged from 1% to 8% per day, or 4 to 29 times per year.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiplying the yearly occurrences by the range of years and the estimated human population; camera obscura images could have been observed anywhere from 54.8 billion to 4.38 trillion times (5.48x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 4.38x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) over the course of prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications ===
The likely prevalence of prehistoric camera obscuras throughout the human experience suggests several important implications for the development of art, religious beliefs, philosophy and existing cave art.

====Art====
The origins of art have been a significant mystery, because art, as a form of communication, is largely a social construct. The core issue is that there can be no intention to represent an object or scene without first knowing that such a depiction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, I. and Noble, W. (1989). “The Archaeology of Perception: Traces of Depiction and Language.” In Current Anthropology 30. 129.	&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have encountered great difficulty coming up with explanations of how prehistoric people first stumbled upon the idea of the possibility of representation.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, D. (2002). Mind in the Cave. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeo-optical explanation is that images projected inside a dwelling space provided, according to Cambridge professor Nigel Spivey, “… a prototypical visual experience that triggers the concept of representation…”&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence, E-mail from Nigel Spivey to Matt Gatton sent on Monday, March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the images would be shared experiences, visible by everyone in the tent or structure at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W., and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic.” In the Official Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Lisbon 2006, Global State of the Art--SO7 (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) Oxford: Archaeopress. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group could thus collectively experience, discuss, verify, confirm, investigate, and interpret the images projected on the surfaces before them. It is the communal aspect of the images that makes the development of visual art socially feasible.

“A randomly projected image stands for a real object; it says bison without being a flesh and blood bison, planting the idea of a referent, the conceptual beginning of art.” -Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura” in Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faith====
It is also possible that camera obscura images could have fostered religious belief. A broad definition of religion is a belief in an alternative realm that influences physical reality. Theologian Rudolf Otto held that the origins of religion are to be found in the concept of the sacred, the divine presenting itself as something “wholly other” (ganz andere).&lt;ref&gt;Otto, R. (1950 ed.). The idea of the holy; an inquiry into the non-rational factor in the idea of the divine and its relation to the rational [Harvey, J.W., trans.]. New York: Oxford University Press, 1950 ed. Originally published in German as Das Heilige (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  The images projected in Paleolithic tents would have offered an early gateway to the concept of an alternative realm, a glimpse of an "other", that initiated a belief in something that was not seen moment to moment. The images, once seen, lingered in the mind, and took root in the culture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The camera’s image instantly splits a quasi-reality away from reality, peeling off an ‘other’ from the ‘is’; instilling the very idea that animals, plants, and humans have existences in other forms, spirits, on other planes.” - Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once the concept of an alternative realm had taken root, it would have provided a domain for agents of an "other" world to intervene in human affairs. The notion of spirit forms is the very root of animism, the oldest known, and perhaps first, form of religion. The incidental image is possibly the first glimpse of the "divine".&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophy====

The core issue of metaphysics is the investigation of the nature of reality. The images in a Paleolithic tent would trigger a cascade of thoughts about the essence of reality: What is ''that'' plane of existence? And reflexively, what is ''this'' plane?&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only by glimpsing an alternative reality does this reality become open to question — the very start of abstract examination.

====Schematicized distortions====
The projections by camera obscura can also explain some common features among cave paintings of animals and people. Paleolithic [[Cave painting|cave art]] is well known for iconic, schematicized figures, usually with extremely small heads and enormous, often bowed, bodies. Examples of the core elements of some Paleolithic cultures’ visual lexicon — repetition, disconnection, movement, superimposition, and distortion — are expressed in engravings on flat stones and bones within the habitation sites and also on the walls of deep caves.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “The Camera and the Cave: Understanding the style of Palaeolithic art.” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 5 (Feliks, J., ed.) September–October.
Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera, Phase II: Projected images in art and ritual (or why European Upper Palaeolithic art looks the way it does).” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 4 (Feliks, J., ed.) July–August.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, Matt Gatton, Walter Brock, and Dylan Brock set up a room-sized camera obscura on a farm in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The image of a horse was projected on to a small flat stone. It was natural for the artist to catch the image with his torso, the engraving stone secured against the body, and the eyes looking down on the inverted image. In this scenario it was advantageous to tilt the stone slightly. The more the stone was tilted the more the image of the animal distorted, the animal’s head reducing in size and the stomach bowing downward, quite like the distortions seen in some deep cave art.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distortion is known as the [[keystone effect]]. Gatton proposed that the deep cave distortions may have resulted from the camera obscura effects within the tents.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Drawing experiments” in “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paleolithic archaeo-optic concepts in wider culture ===

The hypothesis that paleolithic people would have seen camera obscura effects within their shelters—Gatton’s Paleolithic Camera Obscura Theory—has gained wider exposure in the last several years, including specific references in the following venues.

==Neolithic archaeological optics==
The [[Neolithic]] period offers the possibility to explore optical image projections within built architecture. Neolithic structures range from modest houses to enormous enclosures and mounds, and were constructed using combinations of earth, timber and stone. Archaeo-optic fieldwork has focused upon [[megalithic]] monuments.

=== Megalithic structures ===
Megaliths, or large stones, come in two main types of architectural presentations: freestanding and earth-covered. Individual and groupings of standing stones  — in formations of circles, lines, ovals, ‘U’-shapes, or rectangles — were not employed to support the weight of soil above them, but served as markers. Megalithic chambers designed to bear the weight of a mound of earth, turf, rubble or stone have been classified into groups, including [[dolmen]]s, portal dolmens, [[gallery grave]]s, [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tombs]], [[passage tomb]]s, and [[Court cairn|court tombs]]. The term "dolmen" describes groupings of erected stones supporting one large, flat roof stone, like an oversized rudimentary table. "Portal dolmens" have an angled stone slab supported by uprights that define a chamber, often with an entrance. "Gallery" graves are elongated dolmens consisting of two rows of upright stones (orthostats) supporting a series of flat roof stones (lintels). "Wedge" tombs are wider at the mouth, and narrower as they recede inward. "Passage tombs" have a long boulder-built passage that leads to a buried chamber. "Court" tombs are so-named because they have what appears to be a courtyard encircled by standing stones in front of the tomb chamber. Although many of these structures now appear as freestanding monuments, their stones were often the skeletal substructures of mounds removed by erosion or human action.

A major focus for megalithic chambers is in western Europe: Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, and Iberia. Their origin, chronology and purpose is a subject of ongoing research and debate. In fact, they are not limited to Europe, and are found across Eurasia and the entire globe. Their significance in past cultures is suggested by the labor and resources required to create them. The painstakingly and intricately constructed mounds were significant feats, requiring tens of thousands of hours to construct. For example, it has been speculated that a workforce of 400 working continuously for two months every year would have taken around 16 years to construct the 200,000 tonne cairn at Newgrange.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London: Thames and Hudson. 117-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British Isles and Ireland it is possible that many different kinds of chambered monument, including those constructed from timber, may have been suited to the creation of optical phenomenon. Recent studies have focused upon one format in particular: the megalithic passage tomb.

====Passage tombs====
Passage tombs comprise a single stone-built passageway that gives access to a central chamber, and there may be adjoining chambers or cells. This structure is entirely covered by a mound that might consist of earth, rubble, turf or clay. Their distribution extends across the west of Europe. Determining the exact numbers of these sites is problematic due to the poor preservation of many.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification has been further divided into groups such as the Orkney-Cromarty, Maeshowe and Clava traditions, but all retain the same fundamental format.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  and extends to around 4000 BP at excavated examples of Clava Cairn passage tombs,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A new investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  but this need not imply that they were constructed or used throughout this time.

====Passage tomb Preservation====
The survival of passage tombs is variable and dependent upon many factors. The excavation of two later Neolithic passage graves at Balnuaran of Clava demonstrated that their architecture was inherently unstable and would have likely collapsed within decades of their construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley. R. (1998). “Architecture, Imagination and the Neolithic world.” In Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory, (Mithen, S., ed.). London: Routledge. 227-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier examples, including the Orkney-Cromarty format, appear to generally have been more robust. Passage tombs could also be reused in later times, including the Iron Age and early Medieval, and their Neolithic content was sometimes removed. Some were destroyed when new structures were built upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Hingley, R. (1996). “Ancestors and identity in the later prehistory of Atlantic Scotland: the reuse and reinvention of Neolithic monuments and material culture.” In World Archaeology 28. 231-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most have required consolidation, reconstruction or strengthening to allow public access. In the Boyne Valley, Newgrange and Knowth have undergone significant excavation and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;   In Orkney, the roof of the chamber within Maeshowe has been restored following damage caused by Vikings in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, recent building work has significantly altered their appearance, a critical factor that has to be taken into account when observing and interpreting optical phenomena within their passages and chambers.

====Conundrum of use====
Passage tombs across Europe have long been a focus for myths and legends. Medieval lore has it that wizards, giants, witches, or demons erected the great stones, and that the mounds were the homes of gnomes, elves, faeries, and goblins.&lt;ref&gt;Burl, A. (1999). Circles of Stone: The Prehistoric Rings of Britain and Ireland. London: Harvill Press. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Denmark, passage graves are still referred to as jættestuer (troll houses). An analysis of Irish folk tales revealed that megalithic mounds both served as the burial places of ancient heroes, and were the abodes of supernatural beings.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many passage tombs do indeed contain the remains of the dead—sometimes in significant quantities. For example, excavations at [[Chambered cairn#Maeshowe|Quanterness]] revealed the bones of 157 individuals of various ages, but the total number held within the tomb may have been nearer to 400.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains and artifacts are also found at some sites, including beads, stone balls and pottery.

It appears that burial was not the sole function of passage "tombs". Some sites contain little evidence of human remains, although this could reflect their subsequent histories, while others have evidence for activities by the living. Fires were burnt within sites in Orkney&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and at Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange in Ireland there are examples where images were carved in situ upon stones within their interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. (2004). “By Way of Illustration: Art, Memory and Materiality in the Irish Sea and Beyond.” In The Neolithic of the Irish Sea: Materiality and Traditions of Practice, (Cummings, V. and Fowler, C., eds.) Oxford: Oxbow. 202-13.&lt;/ref&gt;    The passages at a number of sites align with sunrise or sunset at pivotal times of the year causing their otherwise darkened chambers to be illuminated. Many demonstrate extraordinary acoustic properties. Together, these factors suggest that passage tombs might be interpreted as venues for diverse activities that involved both the living and the dead.

=== The use of passage tombs as camera obscuras ===
The principal fieldwork exploring the optical properties of passage tombs has been conducted by Matt Gatton in Denmark, Morgan Saletta in France, Aaron Watson in Wales, Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott in Scotland, and Eva Bosch in Spain.

====Format====
The format of passage tombs is uniquely suited to the creation and control of optical projections. These structures reproduce the fundamental format of a camera obscura&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  and fieldwork has demonstrated that they can indeed have remarkable projection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chamber offers a dark space while the single passageway enables the movement of light to be closely controlled. In some cases their basic configuration alone is sufficient to cast a projection,&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  and a small number offer mechanisms through which light can be closely controlled. For example, the roof-box at Newgrange has evidence for the repeated relocation of quartz blocks that could have been used to manipulate optical projections.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the majority of cases, however, additional apertures were required.

====Restricted access====
The entrances at many passage tombs appear to have been temporarily sealed in a variety of ways: boulders, slabs, blocks, planks or wooden frameworks, as evidenced by postholes by the entrance. Maeshowe has a recess near to the passage entrance that holds a carefully balanced portal stone that can be pivoted into place.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 51.
&lt;/ref&gt;  This leaves a narrow gap between the top of this block and the passage lintels, thereby allowing light to enter even when the passageway is impassable to people.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the roof box at Newgrange is situated above the passageway, as is a comparable feature within Cairn G at Carrowkeel. These apertures could be operated independently to the passages. Even in the absence of such devices only minor additions - stone blocks, a hole in a wooden plank, or an animal hide hung between posts at the entrance - are required to convert the monument into an operational camera obscura. The passage serves as a conduit for light and the rear of the chamber acts as a projection surface.

====Aperture plane====
The character of optical projections within passage tombs is determined by a number of interconnected factors. Lighting inside the monument needs to be low but total darkness is not always required, depending on the relative brightness outside.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Palaeo-camera and the Concept of Representation.” In Pleistocene Coalition News 2 (3). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W. and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The Case for Image Projection in the Palaeolithic.” In Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Global State of the Art (SO7), BAR S2108, (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) 135-41. Oxford: Archaeopress.&lt;/ref&gt;    Observations at the Grey Cairns of Camster by Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott showed that it was possible to cast projections in fog, rain and under heavy cloud, but that such conditions significantly impaired their clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size and brightness of projections can be adjusted both by modifying the size of the aperture and moving the aperture plane itself in relation to the focal plane, which is frequently the wall of the chamber aligned with the passageway. Increasing the focal distance by moving the aperture along the passage increases the size of the projection but also reduces its brightness. Reducing the aperture diameter results in a more focused, but increasingly dark, image. A further contributing factor is the texture of the surface upon which the image is projected. For example, observations by Aaron Watson have revealed that the slab that constitutes the back wall of the chamber at Bryn Celli Ddu is smooth enough to carry a detailed image.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, projections inside Cuween Hill fall upon rough stone walling, requiring the distance between the aperture and focal plane to be increased, thereby enlarging the image in order to render it visible.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of images projected within Neolithic passage tombs ===

====Images of the sun====
When aligned upon the sun, a properly configured passage tomb is capable of casting an enlarged image of the solar disc. As long as the aperture remains static this projected solar disc will move along the wall as the sun moves across the sky. During sunrise, for example, the sun’s image will appear to travel across the chamber and then out along the walls of the passageway. Gatton has suggested that images carved upon the chamber walls of Cairn T at Loughcrew may reproduce these movements of the sun’s disc.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, archaeologist Morgan Saletta reported solar projections within the sites of Grotte de Bounias and Grotte de la Source during equinoctial sunsets. These were a result of the architectural format of these monuments creating sufficiently restricted apertures to cast a distinct, though unfocused, projection.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M.  (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of midsummer sunrise in 2014 and 2015, Aaron Watson documented solar projections within Bryn Celli Ddu. By locating the aperture close to the chamber it was possible to cast a distinct image of nearby trees and the rising sun, together framed by the outline of the passage. In contrast, relocating the aperture to the passage entrance significantly enlarged the sun’s disc to a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of aligned monuments====
If a passage tomb is aligned upon another monument, the camera obscura method can be used to project recognisable images of that monument into the chamber. For example, while the setting sun shines directly into Maeshowe’s chamber when the sun is at its southwestern extreme (winter solstice sunset), there is also a reverse alignment (summer solstice sunrise) when the sun is at its northeastern extreme. This will illuminate the distant Barnhouse Stone such that its image could be projected inside Maeshowe’s chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Balnuaran of Clava, two neighbouring passage tombs share a south-westerly axis in order that their passageways open towards the midwinter sunset.&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only does the cairn to the south-west appear centrally framed when looking down the passage from that to the north-east, but fieldwork by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips has documented how the midwinter setting sun appears to descend directly into the apex of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” In Current Archaeology 165. 332-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of the landscape====
Many passage tombs are set in elevated situations with extensive views, or even focused upon distinctive topographic features. These would therefore appear within optical projections inside their chambers. Aaron Watson has documented optical projections inside Cuween Hill, Orkney, that feature expansive views across the Bay of Firth. Inside the Dwarfie Stane, also in Orkney, it is possible to cast a panoramic image of the uplands of Hoy.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of passage tombs may have lost their lintels and roofs it is possible to consider the views that may originally have been projected into their chambers. For example, the ruinous site of Badnabay, north-west Scotland, appears to be aligned upon a mountain with a distinctive profile.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of people====
Reflected sunlight can illuminate people located within passage tomb forecourts, creating what Gatton has described as "spirit" projections due to their ephemeral, spectral qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  When backlit these figures appear as dark silhouettes, but at those times when the sun is behind the monument, and the forecourt area brightly lit, they are enhanced in color and detail. Aaron Watson has photographed optical projections of people inside Cuween Hill, Wideford Hill, Vinquoy Hill, the Dwarfie Stane and the Grey Cairns of Camster.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera obscura projections are animated in a manner akin to cinematography and, while projected human figures appear upside down and back to front, they move in real time. This creates distinctive illusions where individuals, or even groups of people, can appear to emerge from the chamber wall. As the angles between the external subject and the aperture become increasingly oblique, projections can also be cast upon the floor, walls and ceiling of a monument. This can create the illusion of a human shadow moving through the passage tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immersive multisensory experiences within passage tombs ===
Passage tomb architecture spatially constrains the number of people who can simultaneously occupy their chambers, effectively restricting access to specialist kinds of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (1992). “Monuments, Movement and the Context of Megalithic Art.” In Vessels for the Ancestors, (Sharples, N. and Sheridan, A., Eds.) Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  and unusual combinations of sensory experience. Whether these sites embody astronomical orientations, occupy special places in the landscape, or acted as the receptacles for ancestral remains, the camera obscura theory expands the significance and meaning of light entering these monuments.

Inverted images of the outside world, viewed by people located in the depths of a megalithic cairn, would very effectively generate a sense of "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, people in the Neolithic did not share present-day knowledge of optical physics, and would have had their own understandings. Even from a scientific perspective, however, the act of witnessing the projection of the sun’s disc, or human figures emerging from a stone wall, is rather suggestive of an encounter with the supernatural. It has been suggested that projections of the sun may have been interpreted as the manifestation of a Neolithic solar deity.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, optical projections converge with other sensory qualities of these places, potentially including the presence of the remains of the dead, rock art, and dynamic archaeo-acoustic sound effects. There is also a possibility that these kinds of experiences were combined and choreographed in order to maximize their theatrical impact upon an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2001). “The Sounds of Transformation: Acoustics, Monuments and Ritual in the British Neolithic.” In The Archaeology of Shamanism, (Price, N., ed.) London: Routledge. 178-92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than silent places of the death, passage tombs may have acted as places where people could engage with powerful multi-sensory experiences that transported their occupants to other dimensions, or brought them into the presence of forces that are difficult to imagine in the present day.

==Ancient Egyptian funerary monuments==
The Ancient Egyptians may have also witnessed—and recorded—camera obscura effects. Ancient Egyptian texts, known collectively as the [[Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld|Books of the Netherworld]], describe pharaonic funerary complexes as sun-powered resurrection machines that somehow affected a merger of the pharaoh's soul with the sun god.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, M. (1997). The Complete Pyramids: Solving the Ancient Mysteries. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 20. For an explanation of how the sun sets off the resurrection process see page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continuation of the entire cosmos was dependent upon the sun god who was regenerated in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. (1999). Akhenaten and the Religion of Light [David Lorton, trans.] Ithaca: Cornell University Press. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptian concept of the pharaonic soul was complicated and divided into several aspects. The [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka .28vital spark.29|''ka'' aspect]] was a spirit double, created at birth, with the physical appearance of the person. After death, the ''ka'' would leave the body and travel through the underworld at night and return to its physical representation (the mummy, statue, or artworks) each morning. [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] mortuary temples, which faced east toward the dawn sun and were affixed to the side of [[pyramid]]s during the pyramid building era, featured a darkened inner sanctuary with a ''ka'' statue of the pharaoh. When the sun rose on the horizon, its rays would travel down the central passageway of the temple, and project the image of the sun onto the ''ka'' and, conversely, reflect the ''ka'' back to the sun, uniting the two.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the conceptual leap that underpins Ancient Egyptian culture — the pharaoh’s soul road on a beam of light.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek mystery cult rites==
Mystery religions dominated the Mediterranean sphere during classical antiquity. The foremost Mystery sect was the hallowed rite of the Goddess [[Persephone]] at Eleusis, Greece, which held sway for nearly two thousand years (from at least 1500 BCE until the end of fourth century CE). The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] started out as a small localized religion, grew steadily, and were adopted as part of the state religion of nearby Athens around 600 BCE.

Inside the dark cavernous temple was a sacred smaller building that held cult objects, normally sculptural idols, and a very bright fire. In the temple, the initiates had a direct face-to-face experience with the gods, who appeared as phantoms of light. Plato describes initiates experiencing “perfect, simple, calm, and blissful apparitions [eudaímona phásmata] in a pure light …” ([[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D250c 250c]).

The optical principle of the camera obscura — an image cast into a dark area from an adjacent bright area via a small aperture — works irrespective of the scale of the dark and light areas. If the inside of a room is made very bright and the outside is very dark then a hole will cast the image from the smaller space to the larger, rather like a movie projector in a theater.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Gatton has proposed the priests (or priestesses) at Eleusis had operated a rudimentary projection booth, an "Eleusinian Projector", where the priest’s holy fire-room acted as the box of light and the dark cavernous space crowded with initiates was the theater.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The initiates were not directing their attention toward the priest or the sacred house, but looking the other direction at spectral images that they believed were gods, shining and moving about…” 	-Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Moscow branch===
The Moscow branch ({{coord|55.6544|37.5334|type:landmark_region:RU|display=inline,title|name=Astro Space Center, Moscow branch}}) is itself divided into approximately eight divisions. These branches conduct research in [[Theoretical physics]], the thermal history of the universe,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[http://asc-lebedev.ru/index.php?dep=3  Division of Quantum Astrophysics] and  MS Burgin, VL Kautz, NN Shakhvorostova "On the influence of shock transitions on cosmological hydrogen recombination spectrum"  [[Astronomy Letters]], v. 32, p. 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; various properties of extragalactic objects,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[http://asc-lebedev.ru/index.php?dep=4  Space Radio Astronomy],  and  AE Volvach et al, "Variability of radiation blazar 3С454.3 for the period 40 years," [[Astronomical Journal]], 2007, Volume 84, № 6, pp. 503-513.&lt;/ref&gt; and design and development of space and astronomy research equipment&lt;ref group=note&gt;[http://asc-lebedev.ru/index.php?dep=5  Department of Space Electronics]&lt;/ref&gt; The research of the Moscow Branch enters other related areas of research.

===Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory===
{{main|Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory}}

Another division of ASC LPI is the Pushchino observatory, at {{coord|54.8232|37.6331|type:landmark_region:RU|display=inline|name=Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory}}. It has an array of antennas running N-S and E-W, and produced a [[fan beam]] in the sky. It is sited near [[Pushchino]].

It employs 45 [[researcher]]s along with 60 [[engineer]]s and [[technician]]s to accomplish staff the several major departments and several labs of the observatory. These are combined with 80 other people who perform administrative duties, workshops, garage, and a staff of guards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16565">{{Ancient Roman religion}}
The '''Bacchanalia''' were [[Roman festivals]] of Bacchus, based on various [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] elements of the Greek [[Dionysia]]. They seem to have been popular, and well-organised, throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula. They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of [[Liber]], and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC but like all [[mystery religions]] of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites.

[[Livy]], writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalised, extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia. Modern scholarship takes a skeptical approach to his allegations of frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes, and the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. Livy claims that seven thousand cult leaders and followers were arrested, and that most were executed.

Senatorial [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|legislation to reform the Bacchanalia]] in 186 BC attempted to control their size, organisation, and priesthoods, under threat of the death penalty. This may have been motivated less by the kind of lurid and dramatic rumours that Livy describes than by the senate's determination to assert its civil and religious authority over Rome and her allies, after the prolonged social, political and military crisis of the [[Second Punic War]]. The reformed Bacchanalia rites may have been merged with the [[Liberalia]] festival. Bacchus, Liber and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable from the late Republican era onward, and their mystery [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]s persisted well into the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]].

==Background and development==
{{See also|Bacchus|Liber|Dionysia|Dionysian Mysteries}}
The Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god of wine, freedom, intoxication and ecstasy. They were based on the Greek [[Dionysia]] and the [[Dionysian mysteries]], and probably arrived in Rome c. 200 BC via the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and from [[Etruria]], Rome's northern neighbour. Like all [[mystery cult]]s, the Bacchanalia were held in strict privacy, and initiates were bound to secrecy; what little is known of the cult and its rites derives from Greek and Roman literature, plays, statuary and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest sources is Greek playwright [[Euripides]]'s ''[[The Bacchae]]'', which won the Athenian Dionysia competition in 405 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]], the principal Roman literary source on the early Bacchanalia, as he reports a major political incident involving one form of the cult, names [[Paculla Annia]], a [[Campania#Roman period|Campania]]n priestess of Bacchus, as the founder of a [[Religion in ancient Rome#Religio and the state|private, unofficial]] Bacchanalia cult in Rome, based at the grove of [[Semele#Semele in Roman culture|Stimula]], where the western slope of the [[Aventine Hill]] descends to the [[Tiber]]. The Aventine was an ethnically mixed district, strongly identified with Rome's [[plebeian]] class and the ingress of new and foreign cults.&lt;ref&gt;"No other location approaches [its] concentration of foreign cults": see Eric M. Orlin, "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The wine and fertility god [[Liber Pater]] ("The Free Father"), divine patron of plebeian rights, freedoms and [[augur]]y, had a long-established official cult in the nearby [[Aventine Triad|temple he shared with Ceres and Libera]].&lt;ref&gt;Only official introductions, controlled by Rome's ruling elite, conferred legitimacy on foreign cults in Rome; see Sarolta A. Takács, "Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E" in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Roman sources describe him as Rome's equivalent to Dionysus and Bacchus, both of whom were sometimes titled  ''eleutherios'' (liberator).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims the earliest version as open to women only, and held on three days of the year, in daylight; while in nearby Etruria, north of Rome, a "Greek of humble origin, versed in sacrifices and soothsaying" had established a nocturnal version, added wine and feasting to the mix, and thus acquired an enthusiastic following of women and men;&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takács, Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E., ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p.305: the "Greek of humble origin" (''Graecus ignobilis'', in Livy, 39.8.3) may be understood as an ethnically Greek, itinerant priest of Dionysus.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy says that Paculla Annia corrupted Rome's unofficial but morally acceptable Bacchic cult by introducing the Etruscan version, with five, always nocturnal cult meetings a month, open to all social classes, ages and sexes—starting with her own sons; the new celebrations and initiations featured wine-fueled violence and violent sexual promiscuity, in which the screams of the abused were drowned out by the din of drums and cymbals. Those who resisted or betrayed the cult were disposed of. Under cover of religion, priests and acolytes broke civil, moral and religious laws with impunity. Livy also claims that while the cult held particular appeal to those of uneducated and fickle mind (''levitas animi''), such as the young, plebeians, women and "men most like women", most of the city's population was involved, and even Rome's highest class was not immune. An ex-initiate and prostitute named Hispala Faecenia, fearing the cult's vengeance for her betrayal but more fearful for her young, upper class client and protegé, told all to the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 186 BC)|Postumius]], who presented it to a shocked [[Roman senate]] as a dire national emergency. Once investigations were complete, the senate rewarded and protected informants, and suppressed the cult "throughout Italy"—or rather, forced its reformation, in the course of which seven thousand persons were arrested, most of whom were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Overview in Erich S. Gruen, "The Bacchanalia affair", in ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, p. 34 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNm4WKaQd6gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false52.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Livy5&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/livy39.asp For Livy's account, see Livy, ''The History of Rome'', Vol 5, Book 39, IX.] Modern scholarly sources offer various estimates on the number executed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform==
[[File:Sarcophagus with Scenes of Bacchus - Getty Villa - Collection.jpg|thumb|left|Bacchanal on a [[Roman sarcophagus]] of 210-220 AD]]
Legislation of 186 survives in the form of an inscription. Known as the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'', it brought the Bacchanalia under control of the senate, and thus of the Roman [[pontifex|pontifices]]. The existing cult chapters and colleges were dismantled. Congregations of mixed gender were permitted, but were limited to no more than two men and three women, and any Bacchanalia gathering must seek prior permission from the Senate. Men were forbidden Bacchus' priesthood.

Despite their official suppression, illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;See Sarolta A. Takács, Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E., ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p.301. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3185221]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed, officially approved Bacchic cults would have borne little resemblance to the earlier crowded, ecstatic and uninhibited Bacchanalia. Similar attrition may have been imposed on Liber's cults; his perceived or actual association with the Bacchanalia may be the reason that his Liberalia ''ludi'' of 17 March were temporarily moved to Ceres' [[Cerealia]] of 12–19 April. They were restored when the ferocity of reaction eased, but in approved, much modified form.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Livy's account of the Bacchanalia has been described as "tendentious to say the least".&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Orlin, "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As a political and social conservative, he had a deep mistrust of mystery religions, and probably understood any form of Bacchanalia as a sign of Roman degeneracy.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, P. G., "Making a Drama out of a Crisis: Livy on the Bacchanalia", Greece &amp; Rome, Second Series, Vol. 43, No. 2, Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association, 1996, p. 190. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/gr/43.2.188&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of his ''[[dramatis personae]]'' are known historical figures, their speeches are implausibly circumstantial, and his characters, [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s and plot developments draw more from Roman [[satyr play]]s than from the Bacchanalia themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The plots and stock characters of Greek-based Satyr plays would have been familiar to Roman audiences from around the 3rd century BC, as they certainly were in Livy's day, 200 years on. See Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 191.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3297899]&lt;/ref&gt; Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes he attributes to her.&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Orlin, "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), University of Michigan Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the changes attributed to Paculla Annia as unlikely, see Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, pp 48–54: Hispala Faecina is the standard "golden-hearted prostitute" whose courage and loyalty outweigh her low origin and profession, and her fear of reprisal, see Victoria Emma Pagán, ''Conspiracy Narratives in Roman History'', University of Texas Press, 2004, pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;..."the Bacchic passages in the Roman drama, taken over from their Greek models, presented a pejorative image of the Bacchic cult which predisposed the Romans towards persecution before the consul denounced the cult in 186." Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Livy, the cult's greatest offences arose from indiscriminate mixing of freeborn Romans of both sexes and all ages at night, a time when passions are easily aroused, especially given wine and unrestricted opportunity. Women at these gatherings, he says, outnumbered men; and his account has the consul Postumius stress the overwhelmingly female nature and organisation of the cult. Yet the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' itself allows women to outnumber men, by three to two, at any permitted gathering; and it expressly forbids Bacchic priesthoods to men.&lt;ref&gt;cf later descriptions of  [[Liber]]'s "aged priestesses" who offer sacrifice at the [[Liberalia]] festival.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy's own narrative names all but one of the offending cult leaders as male, which seems to eliminate any perceived "conspiracy of women".&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, E. ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', University of California Press, 1996, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender seems to have motivated the Senate's response no more than any other cause.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, C., ''Women's religious activity in the Roman Republic'', UNC Press Books, 2006, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy's insistently negative account of the cult's Greek origins and low moral character—not even Bacchus is exempt from this judgment—may have sought to justify its suppression as a sudden "infiltration of too many Greek elements into Roman worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orlin|first=Eric|editor=In Rüpke, J|title=A Companion to Roman Religion|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-2943-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cult had, however, been active in Rome for many years before its supposedly abrupt discovery, and Bacchic and Dionysiac cults had been part of life in Roman and allied, Greek-speaking Italy for many decades. Greek cults and Greek influences had been part of Rome's religious life since the 5th century BC, and Rome's acquisition of foreign cults—Greek or otherwise—through alliance, treaty, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|capture]] or conquest was a cornerstone of its foreign policy, and an essential feature of its eventual hegemony. While the pace of such introductions had gathered rapidly during the 3rd century, contemporary evidence of the Bacchanalia reform betrays no anti-Greek or anti-foreign policy or sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Orlin, "Urban Religion in the Middle and Late Republic", in Jorge Rüpke (editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Blackwell, 2007, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gruen interprets the ''Senatus consultum'' as a piece of ''[[realpolitik]]'', a display of the Roman senate's authority to its Italian allies after the Second Punic War, and a reminder to any Roman politician, populist and would-be generalissimo that the Senate's collective authority trumped all personal ambition.&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', University of California Press, 1996, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the extent and ferocity of the official response to the Bacchanalia was probably unprecedented, and betrays some form of [[moral panic]] on the part of Roman authorities; [[Walter Burkert|Burkert]] finds "nothing comparable in religious history before the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecutions of Christians]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Ancient Mystery Religions'', Harvard University Press, 1987, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;During the Punic crisis, some foreign cults and oracles had been repressed by Rome, but on much smaller scale and not outside Rome itself. See Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', BRILL, 1990, pp.34-78: on precedents see p.41 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=dnOPjX6GOrgC&amp;lpg=PA75]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, ''bacchanalia'' can mean any uninhibited or drunken revelry. The bacchanal in art describes any small group of revellers, often including satyrs and perhaps Bacchus or Silenus, usually in a landscape setting. The subject was popular from the Renaissance onwards, and usually included a large degree of nudity among the figures.

There are varied and nuanced understandings of the precise nature of a Buddha expressed in the different Buddhist traditions and movements.

==Theravada==

===Basic View: Buddha was a Perfect Human Being===
[[Theravada]] Buddhists base their view of the Buddha on the [[Pali Canon]], which appear to be the oldest surviving Buddhist scriptures. From the accounts contained in the Pali Canon emerges the view that Buddha was a human being &amp;mdash; a perfected human being. Buddha was also possessed of all the various supernatural powers, and mastered these to the greatest extent possible ([[Digha Nikaya]] 11: Kevatta Sutta). The body and mind of a Buddha (while alive) are impermanent and changing, just like the body and mind of ordinary people. A Buddha does recognize the unchanging nature of the Dharma, which is an eternal principle, and an unconditioned and timeless phenomenon.

When Buddha died at the age of 80, his body and mind both came to an end. After death, the state of Buddha is undefinable ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN 22]]). However, a Buddha definitely does not experience [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] after death, but experiences the attainment of [[Parinibbana]] (the ultimate [[Nirvana]]). There is thus an end to the life-continuity of rebirths succeeding one another (this is one of the meanings of [[samsara]]).

In Theravada, a Buddha is not regarded as a [[god]] nor as having created the universe or ruling over it.

===Meaning of 'Whoever Sees the Dharma Sees Me'===
Theravada Buddhism interprets the statement by Buddha that "whoever sees the Dharma sees me (that is; the Buddha)"&lt;ref&gt;Pali Canon, S III.XXII.87(5.5) / S III.120&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the whole conversation which the Buddha held on that occasion. The goal of this teaching was to make clear that the physical body of the Buddha is not the essence of his being, and that seeing his body doesn't tell you much about him at all. Even when one is sitting next to him, if one doesn't know his teaching (or sees the truth he discovered: [[Dharma]]), one is really far from him. But when one sees the Dharma, even if one is very far away, it is as if one is very close to him, because one really sees what Buddhahood is about. According to the Theravada tradition, the context of the teaching thus does not support any claim for the Buddha to have meant that his existence is God-like (permanent, unchanging, timeless), which is how this sentence is sometimes interpreted in Mahayana Buddhism.

==Early Buddhist Schools==

===Sarvastivada===

====Dharmakāya====
{{Main|Dharmakaya}}

====Vipāka-kāya / Rūpa-kāya====

====Nirmāna-kāya====

===Mahāsānghika===
According to the descriptions of sectarian tenets by [[Vasumitra]], [[Bhavaviveka]] and [[Vinitadeva]], the main [[Mahāsāmghika|Mahāsānghika]] theses, apparently also held in common by all the [[Mahāsānghika]] sub-groups, concerning the nature of Buddhas were:
* Buddhas are supramundane.
* Buddhas are devoid of all impurities (''anāsrava'') and mundane qualities.
* Buddhas preach the Dharma with every verbal utterance they make.
* Buddhas can express all elements of the Dharma by uttering a single sound.
* The material body (''rūpakāya'') of Buddhas is unlimited (''anatman'')
* The supernatural powers (''prabhāva'') of Buddhas are unlimited.
* The longevity of Buddhas is unlimited.
* In order to convert beings and to generate pure faith within them, Buddhas have no thought of satiation
* Buddhas neither sleep nor dream
* Buddhas reply to questions without the need for reflection.
* Buddhas never actually utter any words since they abide in eternal [[samādhi]] or meditative concentration, but beings perceive words to have been uttered.
* Buddhas understand all things with one momentary thought.
* Buddhas know all things because insight or ''prajñā'' is conjoined to that one momentary thought.
* The knowledge of cessation and of non-arising in the future are sustained continuously in Buddhas until they enter [[parinirvāna]].
* There are Buddhas dwelling in all directions of the compass.

==Mahayana==

===Early Mahayana===

===Mid-period Mahayana===

====Eternal Buddha====
{{main|Eternal Buddha}}
An important doctrine that flourished during the middle period of the unfolding of the Mahayana - and is still important today amongst certain Mahayana schools of Buddhism - is that of the Buddha's immortality and eternity. The idea of an eternal Buddha is a notion popularly associated with the Mahayana scripture, the [[Lotus Sutra]], which was written down about 500 years after [[Shakyamuni]]`s preaching of it.. The Lotus Sutra has the Buddha indicating that he became awakened countless, immeasurable, inconceivable trillions of aeons ("kalpas") ago and that his lifetime is "forever existing and immortal". The sutra itself, however, does not directly employ the phrase "eternal Buddha"; yet similar notions are found in other Mahayana scriptures, notably the [[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents the Buddha as the ultimately real, eternal ("nitya"/ "śāśvata"), unchanging, blissful, pure Self (Atman) who, as the [[Dharmakaya]], knows of no beginning or end. The notion of an eternal Buddha perhaps finds resonance with the earlier idea of eternal Dharma/Nirvana, of which the Buddha is said to be an embodiment.

While Theravada Buddhism holds back from stating that the Buddha is eternal and emphasises all-round impermanence, some expressions of Mahayana Buddhism, however, regard such an understanding as incomplete. The [[Tathagatagarbha]] sutras provide an allegedly culminational doctrine of a pure Selfhood (the eternal yet ungraspable hypostasis of the Buddha) which no longer generates karma and which subsists eternally in the realm of Nirvana, from which sphere help to suffering worldly beings can be sent forth in the forms of various transitory physical Buddhas ("nirmānakāyas"). While the bodies of these corporeal Buddhas are subject to disease, decline and death - like all impermanent things - the salvational Tathagata or Dharmakaya behind them is forever free from impairment, impermanence and mortality. It is this transcendent yet immanent Dharmakaya-Buddha which is taught in certain major Mahayana sutras to be immutable and eternal and is intimately linked with Dharma itself. According to the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], worldly beings fail to see this eternality of the Buddha and his Dharma. The Buddha declares in that latter Mahayana sutra, which presents itself as the last and most definitive of all sutras: "I say that those who do not know that the Tathagata [Buddha] is eternal are the foremost of the congenitally blind."

====''Buddha-dhatu'' theories====
{{main|Buddha nature}}
'''Buddha-nature''' ([[Classical Chinese]]: 佛性, modern [[pinyin]] ''fó xìng'', literally corresponds to the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], ''Buddha-dhatu'' - "Buddha Element", "Buddha-Principle", but seems to have been used most frequently to translate the Sanskrit ''[[Tathagatagarbha doctrine|Tathāgata-garbha]]'', meaning "Buddha Matrix", which would be more directly translated into Chinese as 如来蔵) is a doctrine important for many schools of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. The Buddha Nature or Buddha Principle (''Buddha-dhatu'') is taught to be a truly real, but internally hidden immortal potency or element within the purest depths of the mind, present in all [[sentience|sentient]] beings, for [[bodhi|awakening]] and becoming a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

====Trikaya theories====
{{Main|Trikaya}}
The ''Trikaya'' doctrine ([[Sanskrit]], literally "Three bodies or personalities"; 三身 [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''Sānshén'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''sanjin'') is an important Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and what a Buddha is. By the 4th century CE the trikaya doctrine had assumed its current form. Briefly the doctrine says that a Buddha has three ''kayas'' or ''bodies'': the ''[[nirmanakaya]]'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space; the ''[[sambhogakaya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is an archetypal manifestation; and the ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' or ''reality body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''. Source:  http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm (accessed:  Saturday January 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the view of [[Anuyoga]], the '[[Mindstream]]' (Sanskrit: ''citta santana'') is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: ''santana''; Wylie: ''rgyud'') that links the Trikaya.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"/&gt; The Trikaya, as a triune, is symbolised by the [[Gankyil]].

'''Cartographic generalization''', or map generalization, is a method for deriving a [[scale (map)|smaller-scale]] [[map]] from a larger scale map or map data&lt;ref name="Li 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Zhilin|title=Digital Map Generalization at the Age of the Enlightenment: A review of the First Forty Years|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=February 2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=80–93|accessdate=|doi=10.1179/000870407x173913}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Whether done manually by a [[cartographer]] or by a computer or set of [[algorithms]], [[generalization]] seeks to abstract [[geospatial information|spatial information]] at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the [[urban area|urbanized area]] of the region.

The cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.

==Methods==
There are many cartographic techniques that may fall into the broad category of generalization.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; Here are brief descriptions of some of the more common methods:

===Selection===

Map generalization is designed to reduce the complexities of the [[reality|real world]] by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that [[geospatial]] data can be reduced is through the selection process.&lt;ref name="Topfer 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Topfer|first1=F|last2=Pillwizer|first2=W|title=The Principles of Selection|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=1966|pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.

===Simplification===
Generalization is not a process that only removes and selects data, but also a process that simplifies or abstracts it as well. Simplification is a technique where the general shapes of features are retained, while eliminating unnecessary detail. Generally, smaller scale maps have more simplified features than larger scale maps. The [[Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm]] is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification.

Simplification can be achieved in different ways: by eliminating parts of and giving an area a more familiar shape, by removing unimportant points off a shape - usually performed by a software, by eliminating small features such as islands, or by smoothing "rough" features such as straightening curvy lines to highlight their trend.&lt;ref name="Stern, Hurni, Werner, Wiesmann 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=08–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination===

Simplification also takes on other roles when considering the role of combination.  Overall data reduction techniques can also mean that in addition to generalizing elements of particular features, features can also be combined when their separation is irrelevant to the map focus.  A mountain chain may be isolated into several smaller ridges and peaks with intermittent forest in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on the map, as determined by scale.  The map reader has to, again remember, that because of scale limitations combined elements are not concise depictions of natural or manmade features.

===Smoothing===

[[Smoothing]] is also a process that the map maker can employ to reduce the angularity of line work.  Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting.  The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way.  An example of smoothing would be for a jagged roadway, cut through a mountain, to be smoothed out so that the angular turns and transitions appear much more fluid and natural.

===Enhancement===

Enhancement is also a method that can be employed by the cartographer to illuminate specific elements that aid in map reading.  As many of the aforementioned generalizing methods focus on the reduction and omission of detail, the enhancement method concentrates on the addition of detail.  Enhancement can be used to show the true character of the feature being represented and is often used by the cartographer to highlight specific details about his or her specific knowledge, that would otherwise be left out.  An example includes enhancing the detail about specific river rapids so that the map reader may know the facets of traversing the most difficult sections beforehand.  Enhancement can be a valuable tool in aiding the map reader to elements that carry significant weight to the map’s intent.

===Displacement===

Displacement can be employed when 2 objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the azimuthal projection method.

===Exaggeration===

Exaggeration is the selection of map [[symbol]]s that make features appear larger than they really are to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the [[visual hierarchy]]. For example, in a small-scale map, highways, rivers, and railroads may be drawn as thick lines that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because wide lines representing features located near each other will overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregation===

Aggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature. The new feature is of a type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of buildings can be turned into a single region representing an "urban area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GIS and automated generalization==
As [[geographic information systems|GIS]] developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; From this large-scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world.

Several broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time:

* The ''representation-oriented'' view focuses on the representation of data on different scales, which is related to the field of Multi-Representation [[Database]]s (MRDB).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''process-oriented'' view focuses on the process of generalization.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''ladder-approach'' is a stepwise generalization, in which each derived dataset is based on the other database of the next larger scale.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''star-approach'' is the derived data on all scales is based on a single (large-scale) data base.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Scaling law==
There are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking: The problem of spatial heterogeneity|journal=GeoJournal|date=2015a|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9537-y|arxiv=1401.5889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=The fractal nature of maps and mapping|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|date=2015b|volume=29|issue=1|pages=159–174|doi=10.1080/13658816.2014.953165|arxiv=1406.5410}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by '''[[Head/tail Breaks|head/tail breaks]]''',&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015c"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks for visualization of city structure and dynamics|journal=Cities|date=2015c|volume=43|issue=3|pages=69–77|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2014.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks: A new classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=2013|volume=65|pages=482–494|doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.700499}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace Töpfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Scaling as a design principle for cartography|journal=Annals of GIS|date=2017|volume=23|issue=1|pages=67–69|doi=10.1080/19475683.2016.1251491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Baltimore Phenomenon'==
The Baltimore Phenomenon{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although the Baltimore Phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e125 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17069454 |pmc=1626147 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; read the scientific literature and manually curate four types of core data:

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Constitutive rhetoric''' is a theory of [[discourse]] devised by [[James Boyd White]] about the capacity of [[language]] or [[symbols]] to create a collective [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] for an [[audience]], especially by means of [[condensation symbols]], [[literature]], and [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Thomas, ed. “Constitutive Rhetoric” Encyclopedia of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Such discourse often demands that action be taken to reinforce the identity and the beliefs of that identity. White explains that it denotes “the art of constituting character, community and culture in language.”&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''Heracles’ Bow'' (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Constitutive Rhetorical Theory==

The constitutive model of [[rhetoric]] dates back to the ancient Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge.  [[Kenneth Burke]] contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.”&lt;ref&gt;Charland, Maurice. “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.” (The Quarterly Journal of Speech 73.2 1987), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black's]] theory of the [[second persona]] also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and audience through [[textual analysis]]. Audience must adopt a particular [[ethos]] prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these theorists all contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric, [[James Boyd White]] was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described [[rhetoric]] that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within [[culture]], and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling [identity] into being” through [[material culture|material]] [[identification (psychology)|identification]].

According to White, there are two methods of convincing an audience that they belong to an identity. The first is ''peithõ'', persuasion, and the second is deceitful manipulation, or ''dolos''. Using ''peithõ'', speakers convince audiences of shared identity openly and honestly. ''Dolos'' creates belonging through deceit.&lt;ref&gt;White, Heracles’ Bow, 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Maurice Charland further emphasized the importance of the [[narrative]] and [[Marxist theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 616.&lt;/ref&gt;  He observed, “While classical narratives have an ending, constitutive rhetorics leave the task of narrative closure to their constituted subjects”.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, James. “Narrative” Sourcebook on Rhetoric (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2001), 403.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charland’s theory draws from Burke and the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. Althusser explained [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]], or "hailing," as the social phenomenon of a mass audience having already been “recruited” by an [[ideology]]. Ideologies create subjects of discourse for persuasion by further discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis. “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.” The Anthropology of the State (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, “the very existence of social subjects (who would become audience members) is already a rhetorical effect.” &lt;ref&gt;Charland, “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.”,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political speeches, manifestos, and resistance movements participate in this type of discourse, to establish an identity and a call to action within that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;  A leader’s speech calling a “nation” to war establishes a national identity within the discourse or text. A feminist speaking on women’s right establishes the identity of the “woman”. An African-American protesting during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] established an “African-American” identity. Every audience member may take part in shared identity because of common symbolic resources, even as the text may especially [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellate]] a smaller sub-group of the [[audience]]. An identity must be established in contrast to another identity. This creates divisions between “us” and “them,” sometimes creating extreme divisions between different identifications.

In 2015, Halstrøm and Galle picked up on constitutive rhetoric within the field of design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts. Design may be said to aim at providing an audience with a subject position, which it is to confirm. Thus, it aims at persuading by seeking to constitute its audience.&lt;ref&gt;Halstrøm, P. L. &amp; P. Galle. “Design as co-evolution of problem, solution, and audience.” Artifact 3(4), (2015): 3.1-3.13. {{DOI|10.14434/artifact.v3i4.12815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Constitutive rhetoric and theories of logical persuasion (such as [[New Criticism]] or [[Neo-Aristotelianism]]) can be used together, but constitutive rhetoric presumes that belief and identity always precedes logical persuasion. Thus, constitutive rhetoric must address the previous identity and must either coincide with it, or change it.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized the paradox of constitutive rhetoric when he analyzed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. He explained that the men signing the Declaration claimed to be representatives of “the people,” but the people were not yet defined as a nation until that Declaration was signed. His criticism explains that an identity must be established before that identity exists in order for the speaker to represent the ideals of that identity, thus creating a paradoxical relationship in which only a third perspective can truly analyze the identity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defuzzification''' is the process of producing a quantifiable result in [[Crisp logic]], given fuzzy sets and corresponding membership degrees. It is the process that maps a fuzzy set to a crisp set. It is typically needed in [[fuzzy control]] systems. These will have a number of rules that transform a number of variables into a fuzzy result, that is, the result is described in terms of membership in [[fuzzy sets]]. For example, rules designed to decide how much pressure to apply might result in "Decrease Pressure (15%), Maintain Pressure (34%), Increase Pressure (72%)". Defuzzification is interpreting the membership degrees of the fuzzy sets into a specific decision or real value.
[[File:Fuzzy logic.png|thumb|Defuzzification]]

The simplest but least useful defuzzification method is to choose the set with the highest membership, in this case, "Increase Pressure" since it has a 72% membership, and ignore the others, and convert this 72% to some number. The problem with this approach is that it loses information. The rules that called for decreasing or maintaining pressure might as well have not been there in this case.

A common and useful defuzzification technique is ''center of gravity''. First, the results of the rules must be added together in some way. The most typical fuzzy set membership function has the graph of a [[triangle]]. Now, if this triangle were to be cut in a straight horizontal line somewhere between the top and the bottom, and the top portion were to be removed, the remaining portion forms a [[trapezoid]]. The first step of defuzzification typically "chops off" parts of the graphs to form trapezoids (or other shapes if the initial shapes were not triangles). For example, if the output has "Decrease Pressure (15%)", then this triangle will be cut 15% the way up from the bottom. In the most common technique, all of these trapezoids are then superimposed one upon another, forming a single [[geometric shape]]. Then, the [[centroid]] of this shape, called the ''fuzzy centroid'', is calculated. The ''x'' coordinate of the centroid is the defuzzified value.

==Methods==
There are many different methods of defuzzification available, including the following:&lt;ref name=Leekwijck&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=van Leekwijck, W. |author2=Kerre, E.

'''Ecolinguistics''', or '''ecological linguistics''', emerged in the 1990s as a new [[paradigm|frame of study]] of linguistic research, widening [[sociolinguistics]] to take into account not only the social context in which language is embedded, but also the [[ecology|ecological]] context.

[[Michael Halliday]]'s 1990 paper ''New ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.|first=Halliday, M. A.|date=April 1990|title=New Ways of Meaning: A Challenge to Applied Linguistics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED324960}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often credited as a seminal work which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the ecological context and consequences of language. Among other things, the challenge that Halliday put forward was to make linguistics relevant to overarching contemporary issues, particularly the widespread destruction of the [[ecosystem]]s that life depends on. The main example Halliday gave was that of 'economic growth', describing how 'countless texts repeated daily all around the world contain a simple message: growth is good. Many is better than few, more is better than less, big is better than small, grow is better than shrink', which leads to ecologically destructive consequences. 

==Overview==
Since Halliday's initial comments, the field of ecolinguistics has developed in several directions, employing a wide range of linguistic frameworks and tools to investigate language in an ecological context. The [http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ International Ecolinguistics Association], characterizes ecolinguistics in these terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org|title=The International Ecolinguistics Association|website=ecolinguistics-association.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, the 'eco' of ecolinguistics corresponds to ecology in its literal sense of the relationship of organisms (including humans) with other organisms and the physical environment. This is a sense shared with other ecological humanities disciplines such as ecocriticism and ecopsychology.

The term 'ecolinguistics' has also been used with a metaphorical sense of 'ecology', for example in '[[Linguistic ecology]]', 'communication ecology' and 'learning ecology' in ways which do not include consideration of other species or the physical environment. This is becoming less prevalent now as ecolingusitics becomes increasingly understood as a form of ecological humanities/social science.

Another aspect of ecolinguistics is the influence of the natural world on language. In 1996, [[David Abram]]'s book, ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' described how the wider ecology (or 'the more than human world') shapes language in oral cultures (Abram, 1996), helping people attune to their environment. On the other hand, writing has gradually alienated people in literate cultures from the natural world, to the extent that 'our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs' (1996:267).

Overall there are three main areas of interest for ecolinguistics. The first can be described as 'The Ecological Analysis of Language', the second 'Language Diversity', and the third 'The Influence of Ecology on Language'.

==Ecological analysis of language==

The ecological analysis of language draws on a wide range of linguistic tools including critical discourse analysis, framing theory, cognitive linguistics, identity theory, rhetoric and systemic functional grammar to reveal underlying worldviews or the 'stories we live by'. The stories we live by are cognitive structures in the minds of individuals or across a society (social cognition) which influence how people treat each other, other animals, plants, forests, rivers and the physical environment. The stories are questioned from an ecological perspective with reference to an ecological framework (or ecosophy), and judged to be beneficial in encouraging people to protect the ecosystems that life depends on, or destructive in encouraging behavior which damages those ecosystems. Ecolinguistics attempts to make a practical difference in the world through resisting destructive stories and contributing to the search for new stories to live by (Stibbe 2015). Stories which have been exposed and resisted by ecolinguistics include consumerist stories, stories of unlimited economic growth, advertising stories, stories of intensive farming, and stories which represent nature as a machine or a resource. Using Positive Discourse Analysis, ecolinguistics has also searched for new stories to live by through exploring nature writing, poetry, environmental writing and traditional and indigenous forms of language around the world.

This form of analysis started with the application of critical discourse analysis to texts about the environment and environmentalism, in order to reveal hidden assumptions and messages and comment on the effectiveness of these in achieving environmental aims (e.g. Harré et al. 1999). It then developed to include analysis of any discourse which has potential consequences for the future of ecosystems, such as neoliberal economic discourse or discursive constructions of consumerism, gender, politics, agriculture and nature (e.g. Goatly 2000). The cognitive approach and the term 'stories we live by' was introduced in Stibbe (2015), which describes eight kinds of story: ideology, framing, metaphor, evaluation, identity, conviction, salience and erasure. Approaches such as [[environmental communication]] and [[ecocriticism]] have broadly similar aims and techniques to this form of ecolinguistics.

==Language diversity==

Language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the relationship between diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the ecological wisdom (or cultural adaptation to the environment) that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation and linguistic imperialism are allowing dominant language to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important [[Traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]] contained within their languages. One of the goals of ecolinguistic research is to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it (Terralingua 2016, Nettle and Romaine 2000, Harmond 1996, Mühlhaüsler 1995). This research is in line with the United Nations Environment Program's position that:

"Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which can be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and which has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species, and ecosystems. (UNEP 2007)"

Nettle and Romaine (2000:166) write that 'Delicate tropical environments in particular must be managed with care and skill. It is indigenous peoples who have the relevant practical knowledge, since they have been successfully making a living in them for hundreds of generations. Much of this detailed knowledge about local ecosystems is encoded in indigenous language and rapidly being lost'. Mühlhaüsler (2003:60) describes how 'The rapid decline in the world's linguistic diversity thus must be regarded with apprehension by those who perceive the interconnection between linguistic and biological diversity'.

Overall, language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the correlation between the diversity of language and biological diversity, with the ecological wisdom embedded in local cultures being the link between the two.

==Influence of ecology on language==

Abram's early chapter on "The Flesh of Language"  examined the contribution of the sensate body—and of the body's ongoing interaction with the earthly terrain—in the emergence of meaningful speech. A longer chapter on "Animism and the Alphabet" contrasted the discourse of indigenous, oral cultures with the discourse of literate cultures. For oral cultures, the coherence of spoken language is inseparable from the coherence of the surrounding ecology, from the expressive vitality of the more-than-human terrain. For these peoples "it is the animate earth that speaks; human speech is but a part of that vaster discourse." (p.&amp;nbsp;179) A subsequent chapter, entitled "In the Landscape of Language," drew examples from a range of divergent oral cultures to show some of the diverse ways that the local, more-than-human terrain informs and influences the discursive speech of oral cultures. Overall, Abram argues that ecology plays a key role in shaping human language in oral cultures, but with writing this role becomes less and less significant. This results in a situation where ‘our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs’ (1996:267). He therefore argues for using language in ways which bring ecology (or the 'more-than-human-world') back into language:

"there can be no question of simply abandoning literacy, of turning away from all writing. Our task, rather, is that of taking up the written word, with all of its potency, and patiently, carefully, writing language back into the land. Our craft is that of releasing the budded, earthy intelligence of our words, freeing them to respond to the speech of the things themselves - to the green uttering-forth of leaves from the spring branches." (Abram 1996:273)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6733">'''Ecological literacy''' (also referred to as ''ecoliteracy'') is the ability to understand the [[systems ecology|natural systems]] that make [[life]] on [[earth]] possible. To be ecoliterate means understanding the principles of organization of ecological communities (i.e. [[ecosystem]]s) and using those principles for creating [[sustainable]] human communities. The term was [[neologism|coined]] by American educator [[David W. Orr]] and physicist [[Fritjof Capra]] in the 1990s&lt;ref name=orr&gt;{{cite book| last = Orr| first = David|authorlink=David W. Orr|title = Ecological Literacy: Education and the Transition to a Postmodern World| publisher = S.U.N.Y. Press, NY| year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], The Web of Life, Harper Collins (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;- thereby a new value entered education; the “well-being of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Sterling]], Whole Systems Thinking as a Basis for Paradigm Change in Education, PhD paper, University of Bath. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

An ecologically literate society would be a [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[society]] which did not destroy the [[natural environment]] on which they depend. Ecological literacy is a powerful concept as it creates a foundation for an integrated approach to environmental problems. Advocates champion eco-literacy as a new educational paradigm emerging around the poles of [[holism]], [[systems thinking]], [[sustainability]], and [[complexity]]. 

== Overview ==
Ecoliteracy concerns understanding the principles of organisation of ecosystems and their potential application to understanding how to build a sustainable [[human society]].&lt;ref&gt;(Capra, 1997: 89).&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the sciences of systems and ecology in drawing together elements required to foster learning processes toward a deep appreciation of nature and our role in it. Systems thinking is the recognition of the world as an integrated whole rather than a collection of individual elements. Within systems thinking, basic principles of organization become more important than the analysis of various components of the system in isolation. Ecological literacy and systems thinking implies a recognition of the manner in which all phenomenon are part of networks that define the way that element functions. Systems thinking is necessary to understand complex [[interdependence]] of [[ecological systems]], [[social system]]s and other systems on all levels.

According to [[Fritjof Capra]], “In the coming decades, the survival of humanity will depend on our ecological literacy – our ability to understand the basic principles of ecology and to live accordingly. This means that ecoliteracy must become a critical skill for [[politician]]s, business leaders, and professionals in all spheres, and should be the most important part of education at all levels – from primary and secondary schools to colleges, universities, and the continuing education and training of professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], "The New Facts of Life," 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051039/http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David W. Orr]] has stated that the goal of ecological literacy is “built on the recognition that the disorder of ecosystems reflects a prior disorder of mind, making it a central concern to those institutions that purport to improve minds. In other words, the ecological crisis is in every way a crisis of education.... All education is environmental education… by what is included or excluded we teach the young that they are part of or apart from the natural world.” He also emphasizes that ecoliteracy does not only require mastery of subject matter, but the creation of meaningful connections between head, hands, and heart as well.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone and [[Zenobia Barlow]], eds., Ecological Literacy: Educating Our Children for a Sustainable World, Sierra Club Books (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others have reiterated the urgent importance of ecological literacy in today's world, where young people are faced with escalating environmental challenges, including climate change, depletion of resources, and environmentally linked illnesses. {{quote|This generation will require leaders and citizens who can think ecologically, understand the interconnectedness of human and natural systems, and have the will, ability, and courage to act|Michael K. Stone&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone/[[Center for Ecoliteracy]], Smart by Nature: Schooling for Sustainability, Watershed Media (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With an understanding of ecological literacy, [[perceptions]] naturally shift. The need to protect the ecosystems is not simply a belief held by [[environmentalist]]s; it is a biological imperative for survival over the time. This [[Value (ethics)|value]] will become a basic principle for prioritizing thought and action in a sustainable society. In the face of the increasing capacity of industrial systems to destroy habitats and the [[climate system]], the explicit declaration of the principles of ecological literacy – and the resulting awareness of the importance of living within the ecological [[carrying capacity]] of the earth, is increasingly necessary. Whether ecoliteracy can address the infamous [[value-action gap]] is unclear.

'''Environmental chemistry''' is the [[science|scientific study]] of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. It should not be confused with [[green chemistry]], which seeks to reduce potential pollution at its source. It can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[soil]], and [[water body|water]] environments; and the effect of human activity and biological activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] science that includes [[Atmospheric chemistry|atmospheric]], [[Aquatic chemistry|aquatic]] and [[soil chemistry]], as well as heavily relying on [[analytical chemistry]] and being related to [[Environmental science|environmental]] and other areas of science.

Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical processes occurring in the environment which are impacted by humankind's activities. These impacts may be felt on a local scale, through the presence of urban cities' air pollutants or toxic substances arising from a chemical waste site, or on a global scale, through depletion of stratospheric ozone or global warming. The focus in our courses and research activities is upon developing a fundamental understanding of the nature of these chemical processes, so that humankind's activities can be accurately evaluated.

Environmental chemistry involves first understanding how the un[[contamination|contaminated]] environment works, which chemicals in what concentrations are present naturally, and with what effects. Without this it would be impossible to accurately study the effects humans have on the [[Natural environment|environment]] through the release of [[chemicals]].

Environmental [[chemist]]s draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical species in the [[Ecosystem|environment]]. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding [[chemical reaction]]s and [[Chemical equation|equations]], [[solution]]s, [[Units of measurement|units]], [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]], and [[Analytical chemistry|analytical techniques]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Ian. ''Environmental Chemistry, A Modular Approach''. Wiley. 2001. {{ISBN|0-471-48942-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contamination==
A [[contaminant]] is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] present in nature at a level higher than fixed levels or that would not otherwise be there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzardsbay.org/glossary.htm Glossary to the Buzzards Bay Watershed Management Plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Meteorological Society. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=c&amp;p=84 Glossary of Meteorology]&lt;/ref&gt;   This may be due to human activity and bioactivity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with ''[[pollutant]]'', which is a substance that has a detrimental impact on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina State University. Department of Soil Science. [http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/publications/BMPs/glossary.html "Glossary."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE). New York, NY. [http://www.sustainabletable.org/intro/dictionary/ Sustainable Table: Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date.&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;Harrison, R.M (edited by). ''Understanding Our Environment, An Introduction to Environmental Chemistry and Pollution, Third Edition''. Royal Society of Chemistry. 1999. {{ISBN|0-85404-584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "medium" (e.g. soil) or organism (e.g. fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a ''receptor'', whilst a ''sink'' is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant e.g. as carbon sink and its effects by microbes.

==Environmental indicators==

{{Main article|Freshwater environmental quality parameters}}
Chemical measures of [[water quality]] include [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen (DO)]], [[Chemical oxygen demand|chemical oxygen demand (COD)]], [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)]], [[Total dissolved solids|total dissolved solids (TDS)]], [[pH]], nutrients ([[nitrates]] and [[phosphorus]]), [[heavy metals]], soil chemicals (including [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]), and [[pesticide]]s.

==Applications==
Environmental chemistry is used by the [[Environment Agency]] (in [[England]] and [[Wales]]), the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the Association of [[Public Analyst]]s, and other [[List of environmental organizations|environmental agencies]] and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include:
*[[Heavy metals|Heavy metal]] contamination of land by industry. These can then be transported into water bodies and be taken up by living organisms.
*Nutrients leaching from [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land into water courses, which can lead to [[algal bloom]]s and [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC.
[http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/Ag_Runoff_Fact_Sheet.pdf "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] Document No. EPA 841-F-05-001. March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Urban runoff]] of pollutants washing off [[impervious surfaces]] ([[roads]], [[parking lots]], and [[roof]]tops) during rain storms. Typical pollutants include [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]] and other [[hydrocarbon]] compounds, metals, nutrients and [[sediment]] (soil).&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/nps_urban-facts_final.pdf "Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff."] Document No. EPA 841-F-03-003. February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Organometallic]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sigel|first=A.|editor=Sigel, H. |editor2=Sigel, R.K.O. |title=Organometallics in Environment and Toxicology|publisher=RSC publishing|location=Cambridge|year=2010|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=7|isbn=978-1-84755-177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

[[quantitative property|Quantitative]] chemical [[Analytical chemistry|analysis]] is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies.&lt;ref name= vanLoonDuffyp7&gt;{{cite book

Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as [[gravimetric analysis|gravimetric]], [[titration|titrimetric]] and [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and [[mass spectrometry]]: [[Atomic absorption spectrophotometry|Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry]] (AAS) and [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission]] (ICP-AES) or [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric]] (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) and [[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (LC/MS). Tandem Mass spectrometry [[MS/MS]] and High Resolution/Accurate Mass spectrometry [[HR/AM]] offer sub part per trillion detection. Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools.

Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are [[Radiochemistry|radiochemical]]s. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. [[Bioassay]]s and [[immunoassay]]s are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms. Polymerase Chain Reaction [[PCR]] is able to identify species of bacteria and other organisms through specific DNA and RNA gene isolation and amplification and is showing promise as a valuable technique for identifying environmental microbial contamination.

Within the field of [[anthropology]] and other [[social science]]s, [[ethnography]] is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on [[participant observation]]. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a ''genre of writing, one'' used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Works and Lives: The anthropologist as author|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=Stanford CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a '''realist ethnography''', and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.

==Styles of ethnographic realism==
George Marcus and Dick Cushman described and categorized realist ethnographies under certain characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus|first1=George|last2=Cushman|first2=Dick|title=Ethnographies as Texts|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=Jan 1, 1982|volume=11|pages=25–69|jstor=2155775|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.11.100182.000325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Flynn effect]] has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.

Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.&lt;ref name="definitionsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/Euthenics|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Definitions for Euthenics|website=definitions.net|year=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]], the first female student and instructor at MIT.]]
The term was derived in the late 19th century from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''eutheneo'', εὐθηνέω (''eu'', well; the, root of τίθημι ''tithemi'', to cause).

(To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;)

Also from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;

The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]], Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards|Ellen H. Swallow Richards]] (1842&amp;ndash;1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="askdefine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | authorlink = John K. Grandy | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of [[interdisciplinarity]].

===Vassar College Institute of Euthenics===
[[File:Julia Clifford Lathrop first chief US Childrens Bureau.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.]]
After Richards' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna [[Minnie Cumnock Blodgett]] (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, [[John W. Blodgett|John Wood Blodgett]], offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]]. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory" /&gt;

According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, "the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary program]] [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1924/1924-03-17-euthenics.html |title= A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;*{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Helen Drusilla | authorlink = Helen Drusilla Lockwood | title = The Meaning of Euthenics; An Essay on Action as a Tool of Knowledge. | publisher = [[Vassar College]] | location = [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] | year = 1929 | isbn = | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019910382;view=1up;seq=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassar [[Summer Institute of Euthenics]] accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics ([[York &amp; Sawyer]], architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously "believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress."&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |title= The Vassar Summer Institute |author= Vassar Historian |date=  |website= vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher=  |accessdate= 26 August 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011536/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until [[Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir]] (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute" /&gt;

The college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls.  Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle1934"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1934/1934-03-10-coops.html |title= The college announced the trustees' decision to continue for the 1934-35 academic year this year's successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the [[Rubicon Foundation]], to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicleMay1951"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1951/1951-05-23-blodgett-gift.html |title= President Blanding announced a $400,000 gift to the college from the chair of the board of trustees, Katharine Blodgett Hadley '20, through the Rubicon Foundation. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 ''[[New York Times]]'', quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that "preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst"&gt;{{cite web

The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. "Today," one graduate said, "when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

===Today===
Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong [[antifeminism]] movement paralleling even stronger [[women's rights]] movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly [[interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that "Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.

==Relationship with eugenics==
According to Ellen Richards, in her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910):&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;
{{quote|The betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings, is what the author means by Euthenics.

"Human vitality depends upon two primary conditions—[[heredity]] and [[hygiene]]—or conditions preceding birth and conditions during life."

[[Eugenics]] deals with race improvement through heredity.

Euthenics deals with race improvement through environment.

Eugenics is hygiene for the future generations.

Euthenics is hygiene for the present generation.

Eugenics must await careful investigation.

Euthenics has immediate opportunity.

Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing better men now, and thus inevitably creating a better race of men in the future. Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary science on which Eugenics must be based.}}

==Debate, misconceptions and opposition==
[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|[[Lester Frank Ward]]]][[Image:aflexner21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Abraham Flexner]], c. 1895.]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]], 1922]]
[[File:Charles Benedict Davenport.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Benedict Davenport]], ca. 1929]]
Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison "Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics", ([[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), [[Lester Frank Ward|Lester F. Ward]] of [[Brown University]] opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: 
{{quote|Is there, then, nothing to do? Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as [[laissez faire]], which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said [about eugenics] is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, and that in the direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.}}

Ward later noted about the organic environment that:
{{quote|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] has taught us that the chief barrier to the advance of any species of plants or animals is its competition with other plants and animals that contest the same ground. And therefore the fiercest opponents of any species are the members of the same species which demand the same elements of subsistence. Hence the chief form of relief in the organic world consists in the thinning-out of competitors. Any species of animals or plants left free to propagate at its normal rate would overrun the earth in a short time and leave no room for any other species. Any species that is sufficiently vigorous to resist its organic environment will crowd out all others and monopolize the earth. If nature permitted this there could be no variety, but only one monotonous aspect devoid of interest or beauty. Whatever we may think of the harsh method by which this is prevented, we cannot regret that it is prevented, and that we have a world of variety, interest, and aesthetic attractiveness.}}

Vassar historians note that "critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism.  The influential educator and historian of education, [[Abraham Flexner]]—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930)."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle" /&gt;{{cquote|
"Well, what is euthenics?  Euthenics is the 'science of efficient living;' and the 'science' is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture....  The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, 'What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?'  The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!"}}

In the summer of 1926, [[Margaret Sanger]] created a stir when she gave a radio address, called "Racial Betterment", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to "close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'" and proposed efforts to "discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.  (from ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger'', vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)

Eugenicist, [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," found reprinted in the ''Popular Science Monthly'' of January 1911, page 18, 20:&lt;ref name="CharlesBenedictDavenport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davenport | first = Charles Benedict | authorlink = Charles Benedict Davenport | title = Euthenics and Eugenics | journal = [[Popular Science Monthly]] | volume = 78 | location = New York |date=January 1911 | pages =16–20 | url = https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo78newyuoft#page/2/mode/2up | accessdate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly.  Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false.  The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences.  What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting [[protoplasm]].

Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo.  This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of euthenics will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.}}

{{cquote|From intensive study we realize the importance of eugenics—the right of birth, and also the subject of euthenics—the right to environment. Too little credit is given to environment when we speak of children having hereditary traits as "Like father, like son," or "Chip off the old block." Such phrases have their origin from the study of eugenics.  No one has ever taken an [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Edwards]] baby and reared it in a [[Jukes family|Jukes]] environment.}}

'''Fidelity''' when personified in Western art stands for the secular aspect of Faith, or the trust that exists between a master and servant, or in family relationships.  [[Fidelity]] is often represented as a woman, shown holding a golden seal and a key, but may also be represented by a dog. Fidelity may be shown alone, or may be accompanied by a dog, a symbol of not only faithfulness but also fidelity.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, James. Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art. Rev. ed. United States of America: Westview Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, [[Penelope]] or [[Griselda (folklore)|Griselda]] might also stand for fidelity. Fidelity is not in the usual lists of the [[seven virtues]], though it may sometimes be included in such groupings. The plant myrtle (''[[Myrtus]]'') has been associated with fidelity, and hence used in weddings, from Roman times to the present, and wreathed crowns of myrtle may be found in art.

== Fidelity in allegory ==
A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of fidelity personified.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; The deep origins of this can also be recognized in the generic name ''Fido'' given to dogs, which originated from the Latin word ''fidus,'' meaning "trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the faithful dog of Titus Labienus, that would not quit his master's corpse, recorded in [[Pliny's Natural History]] book viii, was briefly recounted in [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'' (1593, etc.) in the explanation of the emblem of ''Fedeltà'' represented as a woman holding a ring and accompanied by a white dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asim.it/iconologia/ICONOLOGIAview.asp?Id=97 Ripa, ''Iconologia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fidelity in portraiture ==
When in a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. When the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's "[[Arnolfini Portrait]]."

== Fidelity and Death ==
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crusaders|crusader]] lying in full armor on his tomb-chest, with a dog beneath his feet is a familiar trope.

In linguistics, a '''filler''' is a sound or word that is spoken in conversation by one participant to signal to others a pause to think without giving the impression of having finished speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Juan, Stephen (2010). "Why do we say 'um', 'er', or 'ah' when we hesitate in speaking?", accessed online [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/06/the_odd_body_language_fillers/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; (These are not to be confused with [[placeholder name]]s, such as ''thingamajig'', ''whatchamacallit'', ''whosawhatsa'' and ''whats'isface'', which refer to objects or people whose names are temporarily forgotten, irrelevant, or unknown.) Fillers fall into the category of [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]], and different languages have different characteristic filler sounds. The term '''filler''' also has a separate use in the syntactic description of [[wh-movement]] constructions.

==In English==
In English, the most common filler sounds are ''ah'' or ''uh'' {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, ''er'' {{IPA|/ɜː/}}, and ''um'' {{IPA|/ʌm/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Disfluency Rates in Conversation: Effects of Age, Relationship, Topic, Role, and Gender |author=BORTFELD &amp; al. |journal=LANGUAGE AND SPEECH |year=2001 |number=2 |volume=44 |pages=123–147 |url=http://psychology.psy.sunysb.edu/sbrennan-/papers/bortetal.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among younger speakers, the fillers "like",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11426737|title=It's, like, so common|last=Winterman|first=Denise|date=2010-09-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; "you know", "I mean", "okay", "so", "actually", "basically", and "right" are among the more prevalent. The use of the [[Valleyspeak]] word "like" as a [[discourse marker]] or vocalized pause is a particularly prominent example of the "Californianization of American youth-speak,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/01/hitchens-like-201001|title=Christopher Hitchens on "Like"|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its further recent spread throughout other English dialects via the mass-media.

Since the advent of computers, especially streaming video, there has been comparison of filler words to "Buffer words."  Buffering, the pause that is experienced while information is retrieved and/or compiled for presentation as a whole, does closely model the cognitive process that accompanies most filler word usage. Similarly, as the increased frequency or duration of buffering in computers indicates data processing deficiencies in a device,the overuse or dependency upon buffering in speech indicate possible cognitive impairment from lack of information, preparation, regard, or confidence, etc.  However, in many cases, buffer words, particularly "like,' "you know," and their ilk, have become parlance in casual conversation, suggesting an imprecise statement that invites the listener to "fill in the gaps" and either acknowledge, confirm, or amend the statement, thus completing the transaction.

== Filler words in different languages ==

Occasionally {{lang|es-ES|pues}} ("well"). Young people in Spain tend to use nowadays the filler {{lang|es-ES|en plan}} (meaning "as", "like" or "in [noun] mode").
* In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], fillers are called {{lang|sv|utfyllnadsord}}; some of the most common are {{lang|sv|öhm}} or  {{lang|sv|öh}}, {{lang|sv|ja}} ("yes"), {{lang|sv|ehm}} or {{lang|sv|eh}} (for example {{lang|sv|eh jag vet inte}}) or {{lang|sv|ba}} (comes from {{lang|sv|bara}}, which means "only"), {{lang|sv|asså}} or {{lang|sv|alltså}} ("therefore", "thus"), {{lang|sv|va}} (comes from {{lang|sv|vad}}, which means "what"), and {{lang|sv|liksom}} and {{lang|sv|typ}} (both similar to the English "like").
* In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], {{lang|ta-Latn|paatheenga-na}} ("if you see...") and {{lang|ta-Latn|apparam}} ("then...") are common.
* In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], {{lang|te|ఇక్కడ ఏంటంటే}} ({{lang|te-Latn|ikkada entante}}, "what's here is...") and {{lang|te|తర్వాత}} ({{lang|te-Latn|tarwatha}}, "then...") are common and there are numerous like this.
* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], {{lang|tr|yani}} ("meaning..."), {{lang|tr|şey}} ("thing"), {{lang|tr|işte}} ("that is"), and {{lang|tr|falan}} ("as such", "so on") are common fillers.
* In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], {{lang|uk|е}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|e}}, similar to "um"), {{lang|uk|ну}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|nu}}, "well"), {{lang|uk|і}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|i}}, "and"), {{lang|uk|цей}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|tsey}}, "this"), {{lang|uk|той-во}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|toy-vo}}, "this one") are common fillers.
* In [[Urdu]], {{lang|ur|یعنی}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|yani}}, "meaning..."), {{lang|ur|فلانا فلانا}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|flana flana}}, "this and that" or "blah blah"), {{lang|ur|ہاں ہاں}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|haan haan}}, "yeah yeah") and {{lang|ur|اچھا}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|acha}}, "ok") are also common fillers.
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], {{lang|cy|de}} or {{lang|cy|ynde}} is used as a filler (loosely the equivalent of "You know?" or "Isn't it?"); {{lang|cy|’lly}} (from {{lang|cy|felly}} – so/like in English, used in northern Wales) and also {{lang|cy|iawn}} (translated 'ok' is used as a filler at the beginning, middle or end of sentences); {{lang|cy|’na ni}} (abbreviation of {{lang|cy|dyna ni}} – there we are); {{lang|cy|ym...}} and {{lang|cy|y...}} are used similarly to the English "um...".

Among language learners, a common pitfall is using fillers from their native tongue. For example, "{{lang|es|Quiero una}} umm.... {{lang|es|quesadilla}}".  While less of a [[shibboleth]], knowing the [[placeholder name]]s (sometimes called kadigans) of a language (e.g. the equivalent of "thingy") can also be useful to attain fluency, such as the French {{wikt-lang|fr|truc}}: "{{lang|fr|Je cherche le truc qu'on utilise pour ouvrir une boîte}}" ("I'm looking for the thingy that you use to open up a can").

==In syntax==
{{Main article|Wh-movement}}

The linguistic term "filler" has another, unrelated use in syntactic terminology. It refers to the pre-posed element that fills in the "gap" in a wh-movement construction. Wh-movement is said to create a long-distance or unbounded "filler-gap dependency". In the following example, there is an object gap associated with the transitive verb ''saw'', and the filler is the wh-phrase ''how many angels'': ''"I don't care [how many angels] she told you she saw."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9991">'''The Global Environment &amp; Trade Study (GETS)''' was a non-profit research institute established in 1994 to study the complex linkages between international trade and environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Global Environment &amp; Trade Study, ''1995–1996 Biennial Report'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  GETS supported numerous research projects on the legal, economic, and ecological aspects of trade and environment.

GETS was centered at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yale.edu/envirocenter/research_completed.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

GETS also studied the expanding role of civil society in [[global governance]].

In 2004, the GETS Board decided that a sufficient amount had been accomplished over the decade, and that it was time to terminate the project.

==Major Accomplishments==
GETS had four major accomplishments:  
* First, GETS helped to raise the consciousness of international institutions and governments about the importance of the trade-environment linkage and about the need for better analytical underpinnings of intergovernmental decisionmaking.  GETS was pleased in 2001 when environment was incorporated as a specific goal of the [[World Trade Organization]] Doha negotiating round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_negotiations_e.htm WTO | Environment - Negotiations on trade and environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, GETS advocated greater transparency at the WTO in documentation and called for opportunities for [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) to submit amicus curiae briefs.  GETS was happy to see the WTO agree to release more documentation and to see the Appellate Body permit [[amicus briefs]] in the United States – Shrimp case.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmeter &amp; Petros C. Mavroidis, ''Dispute Settlement in the World Trade Organization'', Cambridge U. Press, 2d ed. 2004, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third, GETS called for a more environment-friendly interpretation of trade rules, particularly regarding environmental measures being reviewed under Article XX of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). The Appellate Body did so in several landmark WTO cases.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Jackson, "Justice Feliciano and the WTO Environmental Cases: Laying the Foundations of a 'Constitutional Jurisprudence' with Implications for Developing Countries," in Steve Charnovitz, Debra P. Steger &amp; Peter van den Bossche, ''Law in the Service of Human Dignity'', Cambridge U. Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fourth, GETS called for the inclusion of an environmental dimension in emerging bilateral and regional free trade agreements, especially in Latin America.  Progress continues to be made in doing so.

'''Landscape architecture''' is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; erosion control; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

==Definition==
Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[soil sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[civil engineering]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].  The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.

* [[Ecological Design]] any aspect of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with natural processes and [[sustainability]]

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in [[forestry]], nature [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[agriculture]].

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as [[soil science]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]] or [[botany]] that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular [[species]] in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with [[landscape planning]] for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as [[landscape archaeology]] or law to the process of landscape planning.

[[Green roof]] (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive [[roof garden]]s for [[storm water]] management, evapo-transpirative cooling, [[sustainable architecture]], aesthetics, and habitat creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extensive Vegetative Roofs {{!}} Whole Building Design Guide|url = https://www.wbdg.org/resources/greenroofs.php|website = www.wbdg.org|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|300px|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]
{{Main|History of landscape architecture}}
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The first person to write of ''making'' a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828, and [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term "landscape architect" was used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the United States in 1863{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and 
[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (1815–1852),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6412257 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; another early American [[landscape designer]], was editor of ''The Horticulturist'' magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'', was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Horticulture|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204051/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Beatrix Farrand|Beatrix Jones (later Farrand)]] with others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflaonline.org/ The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to urban planning==
[[File:Central park photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]  used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
Through the 19th century, [[urban planning]] became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of [[History of gardening|landscape gardening]] and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and Boston's [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and private estates for the Ford family including [[Fair Lane]] and [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|Gaukler Point]]. One of the original ten founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and the only woman, was [[Beatrix Farrand]]. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; [[Yale]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and the [[Arnold Arboretum]] for [[Harvard]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her numerous private [[estate (land)|estate]] projects include the landmark [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period [[Urban Planning]] has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as [[Civil Engineering]], [[Architecture]] and [[Public Administration]]. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin of Information for the AICP Comprehensive Planning Examination|url=https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_resources/certification/pdf/bulletin.pdf#page=13|website = www.planning.org|quote=There are important distinctions between planners and allied professionals and between planning and related fields. Planners approach problems comprehensively, have a long-range perspective, and deal with unique place-based issues. Although people in related professions (e.g., law, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, real estate development, etc.) and disciplines (humanities, psychology, etc.) often work with planners, they do not necessarily have the same knowledge base, skillset, and approach.
|accessdate = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. [[Roberto Burle Marx]] in [[Brazil]] combined the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

[[Ian McHarg]] was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Ian McHarg: Overlay Maps and the Evaluation of Social and Environmental Costs of Land Use Change|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/23|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozio|first1=Ron|title=Obituary: Ian McHarg Dies|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/university-pennsylvania-prof-ian-mcharg-dies|website=Penn News|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.

==Profession==
In many countries, a professional [[institute]], comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In [[Europe]], [[North America]], parts of [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]], landscape architecture is a regulated profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oala.on.ca |title=The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects |publisher=Oala.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper [[Carlos Thays]], recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the [[University of Buenos Aires|UBA University of Buenos Aires]]''"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo"'' (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]].

===Australia===
The [[Australian Institute of Landscape Architects]] (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org.au/iMIS_Prod/AILAWeb/Become_an_AILA_Member/Join/AILAWeb/Join_or_Renew.aspx?hkey=2d670d90-0f9a-49c9-a901-68bc8fd5ef5e]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute.  For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the ''Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act''.  Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects|Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada]] (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csla-aapc.ca/csla-aapc Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ [http://www.nzila.co.nz www.nzila.co.nz].

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand.  The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.

At international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.
In the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.

ILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.

The profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.

A key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.

Landscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.

Landscape architects are employed in design of:  green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.
They are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilasa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saclap.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt; established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the [[University of Cape Town]] or the [[University of Pretoria]], or landscape technology at the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]], professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.

===United Kingdom===
The UK's professional body is the [[Landscape Institute]] (LI). It is a [[charter]]ed body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building [[sustainable communities]] and fighting [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |title=CC Position Statement |first= |last= |work=landscapeinstitute.org |year=2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043428/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called [[The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.)]]. Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB).  Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/12/28/landscape-architect-2.html |title=Career Advice and Guide for Job Searches - US News Business |publisher=Money.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]].

'''Legalism''' (or nomism), in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], is the act of putting the [[Law of Moses]] above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] beyond [[Sola fide|faith]] (trust) in [[Jesus Christ]], specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the [[Bible]] to narrow and rigid [[Morality|moral]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]]. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not [[Faith in Christianity|faith in God's grace]], is the pre-eminent principle of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see [[covenantal nomism]].

==In the New Testament==
The words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments.  Legalism's root word, "law" (Greek ''nomos''), occurs frequently in the [[New Testament]], and sometimes is interpreted as legalism.  In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in {{bibleverse||Gal.|2:16}}, "''nomou'' is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting [[divine law]] viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ernest De Witt, ''The International Critical Commentary, Galatians'', 1921, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of "legalism", "legalist", or "legalistic", leading [[C.E.B. Cranfield]] to commend "the possibility that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law]], were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology" (legalism).&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, C.E.B., ''The International Critical Commentary, Romans'', 1979, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messianic Jew]]ish Bible translator [[David H. Stern]] cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often "&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''nomos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'legalism' and not God's ''[[Torah]]''", especially in Paul's constructs ''erga nomou'' (literally [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|"works of law"]], rendered by Stern "legalistic observance of ''Torah'' commands") and ''upo nomon'' (literally "under law", rendered by Stern by 13 words, "in subjection to the system which results from perverting the ''Torah'' into legalism").&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H., ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', 1992, pp. 535–8, 552–3, on Gal. 2:16b, 3:23b.&lt;/ref&gt;

One concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some [[Jewish Christians|Jews who had become Christians]] believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as [[Messiah]]), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] and the [[Incident at Antioch]]. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the [[Judaizer]] controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.

Legalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law.  It can be thought of as a works-based religion.  Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Scribes]], [[Judaizers]], and [[Nicolaitans]].  They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace.  Jesus condemned their legalism in [[Woes of the Pharisees|Matthew 23]].  The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.

Legalism is sometimes confused with obedience.  New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.

Legalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light.  See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.

A third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law.  Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].  In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the [[Law of Christ]].  Galatians 2:16 says,  "Knowing that a man is not justified by the [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|works of the law]], but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (King James Version).  The faith here is the [[Law of Christ]] and the law here is the Law of Moses.  The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to  the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.

Legalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his [[Conversion of Paul|conversion]].  Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction.  Acts 26:9–11 reveals, "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to [[blaspheme]]; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[Zealots#Paul the Apostle|zealous]] of the traditions of my fathers" (King James Version).  These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.

However, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] or circumcision.

[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Icon of [[James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. AD 50.]]

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], c. 50, [[James the Just]] decreed the ''Apostolic Decree'':
: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and [from] [[fornication]], and [from] things strangled, and [from] [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]].{{ref|4}} For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day" ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

Though the ''Apostolic Decree'' is no longer observed by many [[Christian denominations]] today, it is still observed in full by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.

== In intra-Christian relations ==

===Roman Catholic Church===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], [[good works]] are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love.  In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.

In an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in ''[[Sola gratia]]'', that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a ''progressive infusion'' of grace in the spirit of the believer.

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], for another example, rejects the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]] as ''legalistic''.  The satisfaction theory states that mankind's [[Original Sin]] violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] of the [[Western Church]].  [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the [[Cross]] in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners.  The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]

===Protestant Churches===
In [[Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Christian]] [[theology]], especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. [[bibliolatry]]). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of [[salvation]] through [[faith]] and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned [[divine grace|grace]] of God.

===In history===

Throughout the [[history of Christianity]], certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the article/interview [http://www.puntoacroce.altervista.org/_Den/T1-Legalismo_Sh.htm "Il legalismo? Parliamone (Legalism? Let's talk about it)"], with the participation of Nicola Martella, Alessandro Ceralli, Silvano Creaco, ''et al.'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* [[Asceticism]], such as [[fasting]] and other forms of self-denial.
* The keeping of [[Christian Sabbath]], especially regarding prohibitions of various otherwise innocent activities on the day of worship.
* Various extra-biblical [[religious law|ordinances]] and customs that become associated not just with wisdom but with holiness, in the contemporary situation, such as prohibitions against [[theater]], [[movies]], [[dance|dancing]], [[rock music]], [[playing card]]s, [[interracial marriage]] or [[mixed bathing]].
* Total abstinence from alcohol (See also [[Christianity and alcohol]].)
* [[Ritualism]], a superficial or superstitious use of customary [[prayer]]s and [[liturgy]].
* Similarly, certain exclusive [[ritual]] practices, such as rigorous insistence on the [[tetragrammaton]] as the only name by which God is honored, dietary laws, [[Saturday Sabbath]], or [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.
* [[Sacrament]]s, especially when the underlying theology allegedly views them as communicating God's grace automatically (compare [[ex opere operato]]).
* Various rigorous and restrictive beliefs, such as that, [[King-James-Only Movement|only the King James Version]] of the Bible constitutes God's word.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', [https://books.google.com/books/about/One_Bible_Only.html?id=uQWTxDdIO6IC&amp;redir_esc=y Beacham, Roy E.; Kevin T. Bauder, ''One Bible Only? Examining Exclusive Claims for the King James Bible'', Kregel Publications, 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The belief that Christian families should [[homeschooling|homeschool]].
* The belief that women should never wear pants or shorts.
* [[Iconoclasm]]
* [[Tithing]]

Several underlying dynamics appear in these controversies.  The permitted scope of [[veneration]] of material objects versus claims that such veneration is [[idolatry]], affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">'''Life chances''' (''Lebenschancen'' in [[German language|German]]) is a social science theory of the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunities]] each individual has to improve their quality of life. The concept was introduced by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. It is a [[probabilistic]] concept, describing how likely it is, given certain factors, that an individual's life will turn out a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;(Hughes 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, life chances are positively [[correlation|correlated]] with one's [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=black&gt;Blackwell, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Opportunities in this sense refer to the extent to which one has access to resources, both tangible ones such as food, clothing and shelter, and intangible ones such as education and health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Life chances comprise the individual's ability to procure [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], have a [[career]] and obtain inner satisfaction; in other words, the ability to satisfy one's [[needs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cuneo, [http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm Max Weber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161957/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Weberian life chances can be seen as an expansion on some of functionalist [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Both Weber and Marx agreed that economic factors were important in determining one's future, but Weber's concepts of life chances are more complex; inspired by, but different from Marx's views on [[social stratification]] and [[social class]]. Where for Marx the [[class status]] was the most important factor, and he correlated life chances with material wealth, Weber introduced such additional factors as [[social mobility]] and [[social equality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowenna Harrison, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140427/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/lowerSixthA.htm Is an unstratified society possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp Life Chances and Social Mobility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916023204/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include those related to one's socioeconomic status, such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=ffg&gt;Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mark La Gory, ''Unhealthy places: the ecology of risk in the urban landscape'', Psychology Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-92372-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415923727&amp;id=Mh0ZV5fl2cAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=-NoWukzqbmGuxhbpmxpbb402R-4 Google Print, p.90-91]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of those factors, like age, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[gender]], are random,&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification&amp;nbsp;– how [[social class]], [[social status]] and [[political affiliation]] affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain [[group (sociology)|groups]] have in common a specific [[causal]] component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of [[economic]] factors:&lt;ref&gt;William C. Cockerham ''Health and social change in [[Russia]] and Eastern Europe
'', Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-92081-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415920809&amp;id=GOZFhIBmN1gC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=oWGnkOVVG5Ih1IjPG0__6J4t5R8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msop&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o2302.htm Multiple Sources of Power&amp;nbsp;– Class, Status, and Party]&lt;/ref&gt; how the [[power (sociology)|power]] of those with [[property]], compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.&lt;ref name=msop/&gt;

Weber also noted that life chances are to certain extent [[Subjectivity|subjective]]: one's assessment of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of [[society]], that outcome and associated positive results are more likely to become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction.&lt;ref name=hewett&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607123432/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/weber/wclass.htm Weber and Class].&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons without such a belief, especially those who consciously espouse or have unconsciously internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to [[learned helplessness]] and its long-term effects.

In terms of [[agency and structure]], life chances represent the structure, the factors that one has no control over; whereas one's [[life conduct]] - values and beliefs, attitude to risk taking, social skills, or more generally, [[free will]]ed choices about one's [[behavior]] - represent the factors one has control over.&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; According to Weber theories, together with life conduct, life chances are responsible for one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

In [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], life chances may have to be balanced against other goals, such as eliminating [[poverty]], ensuring [[Freedom (political)|personal freedom]] or ensuring equality at birth.

==Ascriptive qualities==
The life chances approach suggests that status is not entirely [[Achieved status|achieved]], but is, to some extent, [[Ascribed status|ascribed]]. Overall, in societies emphasizing [[ascription]], opportunity is relatively low and status (in the sense of prestige in the community) is often inherited.
This means that people are, effectively, given their status as a result of the group into which they are born, rather than earning it entirely on merit.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"&gt;Yeates, Nicola. "Sociology Factsheet&amp;nbsp;– Life Chances."www.curriculum-press.co.uk. Bank House, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ascriptive qualities such as [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[Social class|class]] of origin can all affect one's life chances. In all societies parents pass on whatever advantages and disadvantages they have to their children.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"&gt;Beeghley, Leonard. "Sociology and Stratification." The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States. 5th ed. N.p.: Pearson Education, 2008. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A persons’ class of origin determines one's neighborhood they live in, which in turn will affect [[educational attainment]], the people they socialize with, and ultimately their [[class identification]]. A very important factor affecting life chances is housing. Poorer housing will affect health, available facilities, the likelihood of being a victim of crime, and many other aspects of life. Leisure facilities are often located in middle class areas or near non manual work places. Gym membership is expensive and subsidies are rarely available for lower grade staff. Therefore, in general, the middle and upper classes have far greater life chances available than the less advantaged groups.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"/&gt;

If born into a [[wealthy]] family a person will have access to far more desirable resources that can assist them in further enhancing their life chances to a far greater extent than someone who is born into a [[working class]] poor family. One of these resources includes a family's [[social ties]] and the ability for a person with well connected parents to benefit greatly in the status attainment process. [[Status attainment]] refers to how each individual enters an occupation. This encompasses how both ascribed and achieved factors combine, because each individual enters an occupation based on the way their parents’ status produces advantages and disadvantages, their own efforts and abilities, and a degree of luck.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"/&gt;

An additional dimension is the effect of family dynamics on life chances, such as the presence of biological parents, the quality of family relationships, and sibling configuration. For example, it has been demonstrated that children of divorced parents exhibit lower levels of psychological well-being, more problems in their own relationship, a greater risk of experiencing divorce, and also tend to be less educated.&lt;ref&gt;Gugushvili, Alexi. Ascriptive Inequality and Life Chances in Georgia. www.css.ge. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. [http://www.eui.eu/Personal/Researchers/AlexiGugushvili/sept._2012_ENG.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming bad life chances==
[[Max Weber]] discussed the effects of [[social stratification]] on life chances. He argued that life chances are opportunities and possibilities that make up one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Life chances are affected by a number of factors. Some of which include: [[income]], [[social class]], and [[occupational prestige]]. These factors all affect the availability of resources to an individual. For example, when one has low income, they have low life chances. Their education may not be as great and they may not have a high enough income to attain an advanced level of education.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kevin. "life chances." The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology. Ed. Bryan S. Turner. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 338. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Wout Ultee, education is a major aspect of overcoming life chances.&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"&gt;Ultee, Wout. "Life Chances and Resources." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 15 November 2013 [http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433118_ss1-43]&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an education, it is harder to obtain a job that provides a substantial income to provide for a family of four. “Higher education is the way to stay ahead."&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"/&gt; The higher the education, the higher income and [[occupational prestige]] one will have, which results in more resources for an individual and his family.

Early [[Health intervention|intervention]] is also necessary in improving life chances. Save the Children is a non-governmental group that works in the best interest of children. They promote children's rights and the aid children in [[underdeveloped]] countries that need relief. The UK has started an early intervention program that aids in improving life chances early on a child's life. They believe that "No child should endure poverty and no child's life chances should be shaped by the accident of birth."&lt;ref&gt;"Early Intervention Review." Save the Children. Save the Children, Nov. 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This program was made to ensure that [[Educational inequality|inequalities]] in children's learning are tackled before problems can occur and separate them from peers. In order to do so, this program gives parents in lower classes the expertise they need to effectively help their children's learning in a home environment so that they are well prepared when they enter school. An example would be improving the parents' reading level so that they are able to teach their children how to read and write before kindergarten. This allows children in lower classes to be near the same level as children who are in higher classes with higher educated parents. Early intervention will allow for children to start out their education on the right foot, with skills they will need to succeed and achieve a high level of education, thus improving life chances.

==Class identification and lifestyle effects==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Weber noted that life chances are partially determined by [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors, such as by how one perceives their life chances. How one [[perceives]] their life chances is in large part determined by what one perceives their [[social class]] to be since life chances and social class go hand in hand and both [[reinforce]] each other. According to Weber this is because life chances are largely determined by economic factors such as social class. The phenomenon of how you perceive things actually affecting the [[tangible]] outcomes of life chances is explained by [[Robert K. Merton]]'s theory of "self fulfilling prophecy" which he discusses in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Essentially what it means is that individuals can tell themselves something like, "I'm lower class, my family has always been lower class, there's no chance I'm ever going to be well off" and although this statement had the potential to not end up being true, it became true simply because the individual believed it would be so and through his attitude and lack of self-esteem, made it his reality.

If you identify as low social class and believe you are most likely never going to be anything else, this will affect your life conduct in a myriad of ways. which in turn will affect your life chances. For one, the company you keep can lead to you networking with people that will not help you get out of a low socioeconomic environment. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think you are not qualified enough for anything but [[working class]] jobs. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think that pursuing higher education is not for someone of your social standing, further ensuring that you never get above working class work. The relationship between social class, life conduct, and life chances is a strong one that often decides what a person's fate in life will be like.

{{Linguistics}}

In some theories of syntax and grammar, in particular in the Chomskyan schools of [[government and binding theory]] and the [[minimalist program]], the '''Logical Form''' (abbreviated '''LF''' and conventionally spelled with capital initial letters) of a linguistic expression is a [[mental representation]] of it, derived solely from [[surface structure]]. In the words of [[Noam Chomsky]], LF captures "those aspects of semantic representation that are strictly determined by grammar, abstracted from other cognitive systems".{{sfn|Collinge|1990}} It functions as the interface between grammar and conceptual-intentional properties of language, analogous to how the '''[[phonetic form]]''' (abbreviated '''PF''') is the interface between grammar and the audio-perceptual properties of utterances.

Logical Form is the level of representation that affects the semantic interpretation of a sentence. LF is sometimes referred to as a [[Covert (linguistics)|covert]] level of representation, because the output of this level is not actually pronounced by the speaker.{{sfn|Ouhalla|1999}}

Many theories of syntax do not acknowledge the concept of Logical Form (e.g. [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Dependency grammar|Dependency Grammars]], [[Tree-Adjoining Grammar]], etc.), at least not in the way it is understood in Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program. The postulation of such a level of representation remains a subject of debate.

== Syntax interfacing with semantics ==
The notion of Logical Form was originally invented for the purpose of determining [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] scope. As the theory around the Minimalist program developed, all output conditions, such as theta-criterion, the case filter, Subjacency and [[binding theory]], are examined at the level of LF. The study of LF is more broad than the study of [[syntax]].{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003|pages=607, 633}}

=== The notion of scope ===

The definition of scope was introduced early in the development of Logical Form scholarship. The scope of an operator is the domain within which it has the ability to affect the interpretation of other expressions. In other words, an operator has scope of operation, or affecting the interpretation of other phrases, only within its own domain. Three uncontroversial examples of scope affecting some aspect of the interpretation are: quantifier-quantifier, quantifier-[[pronoun]], quantifier-[[negative polarity item]].

In instances where a negation has an indefinite article in its scope, the reader's interpretation is affected. The reader is not able to infer the existence of a relevant entity. If negation (or a negation phrase) is within the subject quantifier scope, [[negation]] is not affected by the quantifier.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}
If the Quantified Expresstion1 (QE1) is in the domain of QE2, but not vice versa, QE1 must take a narrow scope; if both are in the domain of the other, the structure is potentially ambiguous. If neither QE is in the domain of the other, they must be interpreted independently.{{sfn|Ioup|1975}} These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the main clause is not within the domain of the embedded subject. For example, ''that every boy left upset a teacher'', it cannot be interpreted as ''for every boy, there is a possibly different teacher who was upset by the fact that the boy left''. The only available interpretation is that ''one single teacher was upset''.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}

[[File:LF-everyone loves someone 2.png|thumb|Everyone loves the same someone]][[File:LF-everyone loves someone.png|thumb|Everyone has someone that they love, not necessarily the same person]]

=== Ambiguity motivation ===

In syntax, LF exists to give a structural account of certain kinds of [[semantics|semantic]] ambiguities.

==== Example ====

: ''Everyone loves someone.''

This sentence is semantically ambiguous. Specifically, it contains a [[Free variables and bound variables|scope]] ambiguity. This ambiguity cannot be resolved at surface structure, since ''someone'', being within the [[verb phrase]], must be lower in the structure than ''everyone''. This case exemplifies the general fact that natural language is ''insufficiently specified'' for strict logical meaning. Robert May argued for the postulation of LF partly in order to account for such ambiguities (among other motivations). At LF, the sentence above would have two possible structural representations, one for each possible scope-reading, in order to account for the ambiguity by structural differentiation. In this way it is similar in purpose to, but not the same as, [[logical form]] in [[logic]].{{sfn|Hanna|2006|pages=50–51}}

== Quantification ==

=== Key historical developments===
There has been discussion about quantification since the 1970s. In 1974, Montague argued that a grammar for a small fragment of English contains the logicosyntactic and semantic devices to handle practically any scope phenomenon.{{sfn|Montague|1974}} The tool that he mainly relied on is categorical syntax with functional application; in terms of recent formulations, it can be considered Minimalist syntax with [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] only. However, this approach does not make predictions for some examples with inverse scope (wide scope in [[object (grammar)|object]] position).

For example, '''''everyone loves someone'''''.

When there is no scope interaction in the relevant portion of the sentence, making either choice shows no difference in semantics.

A short time later, May suggested a different idea.{{sfn|May|1977}} In contrast to Montague, May did not propose any syntax that generates the surface string. He proposed a rule called Quantifier Raising (QR), which explains that movement operations of [[wh-movement]] continue to operate on the level of LF, and each phrase continues to possess the quantifier in its domain. May suggested that QR applies to all quantifier phrases with no exception.

The study of Quantification carried on in the 1980s. In contrast to May and Montague, it was suggested that independently motivated phrase structure, such as the relative clause, imposes a limitation on scope options.{{sfn|Reinhart|1983}}

This clause boundedness somewhat restricts the QR. May also noticed a subject-object asymmetry with respect to the interaction of wh-words and quantifier phrases.{{sfn|May|1985}} A modified version of his past work that QR determines quantifier scope but does not disambiguate it was brought up. To regulate the interaction, The Scope Principle that if two operators govern each other, they can be interpreted in either scopal order was also brought up. However, this solution has eventually been abandoned.

As [[Minimalism]] showed up in 1990s, more studies have been related to Minimalist syntax.{{sfn|Chomsky|1993}} A strategy to remedy the situation is to eliminate QR and the expected scope would be by-products of entirely independent grammatical processes.{{sfn|Hornstein|1995}} The other strategy is to modify QR and show it can be fitted into a Minimalist structure.{{sfn|Beghelli|1993}}{{sfn|Beghelli|Stowell|1997}}

===Quantificational noun phrases===
Danny Fox discusses syntactic positions of QNPs as a way of introducing and illustrating the basic semantic and syntactic relations found in LF.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} By looking at the meaning of QNPs in relation to the property they are given, or their predicate, we can derive the meaning of the whole sentence.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
a. ''A girl is tall.''

b. ''Many girls are tall.''

c. ''Every girl is tall.''

d. ''No girl is tall.''{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}
To understand the Logical Form of these examples, it is important to identify what the basic [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is and which segments make up the QNPs. In these examples, the predicate is tall and the QNPs are a girl, many girls, every girl and no girl. The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of being tall is attributed to some form of the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who is tall, otherwise the truth value is False.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

Each of the examples above will have different conditions that make the statement true according to the quantifier that precedes girl.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
'''Truth Value conditions:'''

Example a. ''A girl'' has a truth value of '''true if and only if''' ([[iff]]) at least one girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example b. ''Many girls'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' there are many girls who are tall.  &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with more than 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example c. ''Every girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' every girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that every instance of a person being female, she must be tall.

Example d. ''No girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' no girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that for all instances of a person being female, she must not be tall.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}

In a syntactic tree, the structure is represented as such: "the [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of a QNP is always the sister of the QNP."{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

== WH-movement ==
In linguistics, wh-phrases are operators binding variables at LF, like other quantifier noun phrases. Scope interpretations can be constrained by syntactic constraints as shown in LF when regarding the scope of wh-phrases and quantifiers. When [[wh-movement]] is from the subject position it is unambiguous, but when wh-movement is from the object position it is ambiguous.{{sfn|May|1985}}

:''[S’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Only one possible interpretation.)

This example demonstrates the effect of the Path Containment Condition (PCC). An A'-path is a line of dominating nodes that go from the trace to a c-commanding A'-binder. If two of the A'paths intersect then one must be contained in the other. If the paths are overlapping without having one being contained in the other, then it is ill-formed. (2)'s paths are overlapping, violating PCC, therefore in order to obtain a grammatical LF structure, everything needs to join the VP. The LF structure then becomes:

: ''"There are five doctors x such that for some patient y,x prescribed a new pill to y. "''
|}

In the sentence, ''"Five doctors prescribed few new pills to every patient."'', the scope in Hungarian is largely disambiguated by the linear order of quantifiers on the surface. Two facts that should be kept in mind are (1) the linear order is not obtained by putting quantifiers together in the desired order, which contradicts the predictions made by Montague or May's theory; (2) the linear order is not determined by case or grammatical functions, which supports the prediction of Hornstein's theory. {{sfn|Szabolcsi|2002}}

|}

The significance of A-chains has been emphasized in the Chinese language. Scope in Chinese is disambiguated by case positions in some examples. {{sfn|Aoun|Li|1993}} In this example, the active sentence only has subject wide scope, but the passive sentence is ambiguous. The active sentence only has one interpretation: 
if there are two women who read every book, which is in the subject wide scope. According to Aoun and Li, Chinese does not have VP-internal subjects, thus, ''liangge nuren'' cannot be reconstructed in LF. So the sentence has no ambiguous interpretation. However, the passive sentence has two interpretations, 1. everyone finds the same two clues; 2. everyone finds two clues, while two clues can be different ones. That is because ''liangge xiansuo'' is in VP-internal complement position, then in LF, it can be reconstructed. So the passive sentence has two different interpretations.

=== English ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: ''A boy climbed every tree.''
: i. A single boy climbed all the trees.
: ii.For every tree there is a boy, who may be different for each tree, that climbed tree X.
|}

This phrase is ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as the noun 'boy' referring to a particular individual or to a different individual for each instance of 'tree' under the quantifier 'every'.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} The interpretation that a single boy climbed all the trees takes a wide scope, while the other interpretation that for every tree there is a boy, who maybe be different for each tree takes a narrow scope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25341">'''Multiliteracies''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School |date=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an approach to [[literacy]] theory and [[pedagogy]].  This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: [[linguistic diversity]], and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in [[globalized]] environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new [[communications technologies]] such as the [[internet]], [[multimedia]], and [[digital media]], and the existence of growing linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] due to increased transnational migration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new "literacy" must also be used and developed.
 
==Overview==
There are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the [[English language]] is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, [[global language]], there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different [[Englishes]]. The way English is spoken in Australia,  South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK.
 
The second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate.  These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world.

The formulation of  "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains.  The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities.  The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and [[numeracy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application to the real world ==

Due to changes in the world, especially [[globalization]] and an increase in [[immigration]], a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal.  A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice.  Students need to draw on their own experiences and [[semiotic]] literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning.

The changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines.

Educational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, [[vernacular]]s, as well as alternative forms of communication. 

== The New London Group ==
The New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single [[national language]] and [[Standard English|standardized form of English]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; [[Bill Cope (academic)|Bill Cope]] from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; [[Mary Kalantzis]] from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; [[Norman Fairclough]] from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; [[Gunther Kress]] from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]] from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; [[Allan Luke]] from Australia on critical literacy  and [[applied linguistics]]; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and [http://nuragili.unsw.edu.au/profilemartinnakata.html Martin Nataka] on [[indigenous education]] and [[higher education]] curriculum. The article "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures" published in 1996,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|last2=Group|first2=The New London|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the New London Group's "manifesto" of literacy pedagogy that is recommended for use in educational institutions, in the community, and within organizations.

== A pedagogy of multiliteracies ==
The multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of "[[metalanguage]]s" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Situated practice ==
Situated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope &amp; Kalantzis (2009)&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|date=2009-08-06|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15544800903076044|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044|issn=1554-480X}}&lt;/ref&gt; reframed it as “experiencing” (p.&amp;nbsp;184)''.'' They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms.
* Experiencing the known–learners bring their own, invariably diverse knowledge, experiences, interests and life-texts to the learning context. Activities of experiencing the known involve showing or talking about something familiar-listen, view, watch and visit, reflecting on learners' own experiences, interests and perspectives (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title=‘The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.’ pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experiencing the new–learners are immersed in new situations or information, observing or taking part in something that is new or unfamiliar, but within the zone of intelligibility and close to their own life-worlds. For example, teachers introduce something new but which makes sense by immersion in experiments, field trips and investigations in projects (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

Situated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. [http://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-5/kalantzis-and-cope-debating-authentic-pedagogy Authentic pedagogy]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196581.007|title=literacy|last=Kalantzis|first=Mary|last2=Cope|first2=Bill|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|publication-place=Cambridge|pages=95–117|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139196581.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to [http://newlearningonline.com/learning-by-design/glossary/didactic didactic pedagogy] in the twentieth century, initially through the work of [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dewey/ John Dewey] in the United States and [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Montessori Maria Montessori]  in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression.

However, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.

== Critical framing ==
Critical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cope, B.  |author2=Kalantzis, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2001|title = Putting ‘multiliteracies’ to the test|url = https://www.alea.edu.au/documents/item/59|journal = Newsletter of the Australian Literacy Educators Association.|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field.

Mills (2009)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mills|first = Kathy A.|date = 2009|title = Multiliteracies: interrogating competing discourses|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500780802152762|journal = Language and Education, 23:2, 103-116|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as "inferior literacies". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums.

In addition to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. [http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3084/1/D4Writing_and_Multimodal_social_semiotics.pdf Domingo, Jewitt, &amp; Kress (2014)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Multimodal social semiotics: Writing in online contexts|last = Domingo, M., Jewitt, C. and Kress, G|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 1317510607|location = London|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble.

Multiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Flicker, S., Danforth, J., Wilson, C., Oliver, V., Larkin, J., Restoule, J-P, Mitchell, C., Konsmo, E., Jackson, R. &amp; Prentice, T.|date = 2014|title = "Because we have really unique art": Decolonizing research with Indigenous youth using the arts.|url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ijih/article/view/13271|journal = International Journal of Indigenous Health|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, &amp; Buthelezi, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mitchell, C., DeLange, N., Moletsane, R., Stuart, J., &amp; Buthelezi, T.|date = 2005|title = Giving a face to HIV and AIDS: On the uses of photo-voice by teachers and community health care workers working with youth in rural South Africa|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1478088705qp042oa|journal = Qualitative Research in Psychology  |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=257–270|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo &amp; Rowsell, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Prinsloo, M., &amp; Rowsell, J.|date = 2012|title = Digital literacies as placed resources in the globalised periphery|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2012.691511|journal = Language and Education |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–277|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overt instruction ==
===Original view===
In the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, "Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design" (p.&amp;nbsp;116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to "languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;34).

===Updated view===
After applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, 2015).&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; 
Conceptualizing involves "the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p.&amp;nbsp;19) occurs in two ways:
Conceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular.

Activity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things
Conceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;).  
Activity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together

== Transformed practice ==
Transformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in [[Authentic Learning|authentic learning]], where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the "theory becomes [[reflective practice]]" (The New London Group, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic.

Transformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed "Applying" as part of "Knowledge Processes" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;184),&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or [http://edglossary.org/competency-based-learning/ competency-based learning] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title='The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.' pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways:
* Applying appropriately concerns how knowledge is perceived in a typical or predictable way in a particular situation. For instance, meanings are expressed in a way that corresponds to the conventions of a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] or [[meaning-making]] setting (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015). Applying appropriately also involves the application of knowledge and understanding of the complexity of real-world situations. Learners then examine if they are valid. Examples of activities include writing, drawing, solving a problem, or behaving in the usual and expected manner in a real-world situation/[[simulation]] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).
* Applying creatively involves the way learners transform knowledge they have learned from a familiar context and use it in a different context, unfamiliar to learners. As applying creatively is related to being active in the innovative and creative world, learners’ interests, experiences, and aspirations can be promoted. Examples of activities are taking an intellectual risk, applying knowledge to a different setting, suggesting a new problem, and translating knowledge into a different mix of modes of meaning (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

Dyslexia is a complex, lifelong disorder involving difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters and other symbols. Dyslexia does not affect general intelligence, but is often co-diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;ref name="NCLD"&gt;{{cite web|author=NCLD Editorial Team|title=What is Dyslexia|url=http://www.ncld.org/types-learning-disabilities/dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia|publisher=National center for Learning disabilities|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site3074/mainpageS3074P1.html | title = Dyslexia | publisher=Boston Children's Hospital | accessdate = 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least three sub-types of dyslexia that have been recognized by researchers: orthographic, or surface dyslexia, phonological dyslexia and mixed dyslexia where individuals exhibit symptoms of both orthographic and phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name="caplan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=David|title=Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology|year=1987|publisher=New York: Cambridge University Press|pages=201–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that dyslexia is genetic and can be passed down through families, but it is important to note that, although a genetic disorder, there is no specific locus in the brain for reading and writing. The human brain does have language centers (for spoken and gestural communication), but written language is a cultural artifact, and a very complex one requiring brain regions designed to recognize and interpret written symbols as representations of language in rapid synchronization. The complexity of the system and the lack of genetic predisposition for it is one possible explanation for the difficulty in acquiring and understanding written language.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Wolf, Maryanne. "Part III: When the Brain Can't Learn to Read." Wolf, Maryanne. Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain. New York City: HarperCollins Publisher, 2007. 163-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, recent evidence has found that there are certain genes responsible for causing dyslexia.&lt;ref name="NDS"&gt;"[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm Dyslexia Information Page"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm |date=2016-07-27 }}. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 12 May 2010. Retrieved 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests a clear genetic basis for developmental dyslexia with abnormalities in certain language areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Witelson"&gt;Witelson, Sandra. "Developmental Dyslexia: TwoRight Hemispheres and None Left." Science, New Series 195.4275(1977): 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is also evidence that orthography, the correspondence between the language's phonemes (sound units) and its graphemes (characters, symbols, letters), plays a significant role in the type and frequency of dyslexia's manifestations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Paulesu, E, et al. "Dyslexia: Cultural Diversityand Biological Unity." Science 291.5511 (2001): 2165-2167.&lt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/291/5511/2165.full.pdf?sid=e7fcb20f-73c5-49a5-bbc4-f8efd0123b40&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some psycholinguists believe that the complexity of a language’s orthography (whether it has a high phoneme-grapheme correspondence or an irregular correspondence in which sounds don’t clearly map to symbols) affects the severity and occurrence of dyslexia, postulating that a more regular system would reduce the number of cases of dyslexia and/or the severity of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Current psycholinguistic models of dyslexia are "largely developed on the basis of alphabetic writing systems such as English",&lt;ref name="karanth"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karanth, Prathibha |title=The search for deep dyslexia in syllabic writing systems |journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=143–155 |date=March 2002 |pmid= |doi=10.1016/S0911-6044(00)00022-1 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VDV-444807H-5&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=015e4dd9555c8b8eb56797ad842337ec |last2=Jing |first2=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the amount of research on some [[logographic]] orthographies, Chinese in particular,&lt;ref name="pmid19024108"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xu GF, Jing J |title=Major achievements in relation to dyslexia in Chinese characters |journal=Chin. Med. J. |volume=121 |issue=17 |pages=1736–40 |date=September 2008 |pmid=19024108 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also fairly significant. Unfortunately, little research has been done on [[Syllabary|syllabic]] writing systems, and "cross-linguistic studies of the acquired dyslexia and  [[dysgraphia]]s are scarce."&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

==Dyslexia and orthographic features==

===Orthographic Dyslexia===
Orthographic dyslexia, a subtype of dyslexia, results in difficulty decoding and encoding skills due to slow and inaccurate rates of storing word and letter formations into memory. Orthographic dyslexics have difficulty in storing mental representation of words, especially phonetically irregular words such as word spellings that end in -ight ("light" and "sight"). The problems underlying this type of dyslexia are related directly to memory and coding skills that allow representation of printed letters and words, not to poor phonological processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhia|first=Roberts|title=Orthographic Dyslexia: The neglected subtype|year=1997|publisher=The Learning Disabilities Research &amp; Practice|pages=236–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of dyslexia is also termed surface dyslexia because people with this type have the inability to recognize words simply on a visual basis. Words that are misspelled cause the readers difficulty because they attempt to sound out the words by looking at each individual letter rather than the word as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, David. 1987. Disturbances of the sound system. In D. Caplan. Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology: An Introduction, 201-232. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; So a reader might read the word "cat" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" but then read the word "ice" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" as well because they are sounding out each individual phoneme rather than just recognizing the word "ice" in its entirety.

Despite intervention, children suffering from orthographic dyslexia continually have lower achievement reading levels when compared to their peers. Additionally, children show a greater difficulty throughout schooling when spelling words with irregular or unusual orthographies when compared to their other children. Research also shows that dyslexic children have primary difficulties in phonological processing and secondary difficulties in orthographic processing, aiding to the distinction of two subtypes.&lt;ref name="Manis et al., 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manis|first=Franklin|first2=Rebecca|last2=Custodio|last3=Szeszulski|first3=Patricia A.|title=Development of phonological and orthographic skill: A 2-year longitudinal study of dyslexic children|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1993|volume=56|issue=1|pages=64–86|doi=10.1006/jecp.1993.1026|pmid=8366326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effects of orthographic depth on dyslexia===
The complexity of a language's orthography is directly related to the difficulty of learning to read in that language.  Orthographic complexity also contributes to how dyslexia manifests in readers of different languages.&lt;ref name="Wolf1"&gt;[[Maryanne Wolf|Wolf, Maryanne]] (2007). Proust and the squid. Harper Collins. pp. 190-191. {{ISBN|978-0-06-018639-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep orthographies]] are writing systems, such as those of [[English orthography|English]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]], that do not have a one-to-one correspondence between sounds ([[phoneme]]s) and the letters ([[grapheme]]s) that represent them.

[[Shallow orthographies]], such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], have a close relationship between [[grapheme]]s and [[phoneme]]s, and the spelling of words is very consistent. With shallow orthographies, new readers have few problems learning to decode words and as a result children learn to read relatively quickly. Most dyslexic readers of shallow orthographic systems learn to decode words with relative ease compared to dyslexics using deep orthographies, though they continue to have difficulty with reading fluency and comprehension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The hallmark system of dyslexia in a shallow orthography is a comparatively slow speed of [[rapid automatized naming]].
[[File:Dislexia.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Writing and drawing performed by a child with dyslexia, displaying common behavioral symptoms.]]
For languages with relatively deep orthographies, such as [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], readers have greater difficulty learning to decode new words than languages with shallow orthographies. As a result, children's reading achievement levels are lower.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2005-09-06). "Chapter 28: Orthography, Phonology, and Reading Development: A Cross-Linguistic Perspective". in Malatesha, Joshi. Handbook of orthography and literacy. Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc Inc. pp. 463–464. {{ISBN|0-8058-4652-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that the hallmark symptoms of dyslexia in a deep orthography are a deficit in phonological awareness and difficulty reading words at grade level.&lt;ref name="snowling"&gt;Snowling, Margaret J. (2004). "Chapter 4: The science of dyslexia: a review of contemporary approaches. in Turner, Martin and John Rack. The study of dyslexia. Kluwer Academic/Plenum publishers. p. 80. {{ISBN|0-306-48535-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For these dyslexic readers, learning to decode words may take a long time—indeed, in the deepest orthographies a distinctive symptom of dyslexia is the inability to read at the word level—but many dyslexic readers have fewer problems with fluency and comprehension once some level of decoding has been mastered.

Studies between the English and German (which has a shallower orthography than English) languages have shown that the greater depth of the English orthography has a "marked adverse effect on reading skills" among children with dyslexia, though the dyslexics in these studies still mostly underperformed compared to control groups.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landerl |date= 1997 |title=The impact of orthographic consistency on dyslexia: A German-English comparison |journal=Cognition |volume=63 |issue= 3|pages=315–334  |url=  |doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(97)00005-X |pmid=9265873 |first1=K |last2=Wimmer |first2=H |last3=Frith |first3=U }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frith |first=Uta |date= 1998 |title=Differences in Phonological Recoding in German- and English-Speaking Children |journal=Scientific Studies of Reading |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–54  |url=  |doi=10.1207/s1532799xssr0201_2 |last2=Wimmer |first2=Heinz |last3=Landerl |first3=Karin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research, however, has suggested that all children with dyslexia still suffer the same reading difficulties despite different orthographies, including reading speed deficit and slow decoding mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These findings suggest that orthographic differences do not significantly impact the main difficulties those with dyslexia experience.

==Dyslexia in different types of orthographies==
There are a number of different types of writing systems, or orthographies, and they do not necessarily depend on the same neurological skill sets.&lt;ref&gt;Cell Press (2009, October 13). Dyslexia Varies Across Languages. ScienceDaily. Retrieved July 26, 2013, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091012121333.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, certain dyslexic deficits may be more pronounced in some orthographies than in others. For example, in alphabetic languages, [[phonological awareness]] is highly predictive of reading ability. But in Chinese (a logographic system), orthographic awareness and [[Fine motor skill|motor programming]] are highly predictive of reading ability.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871"&gt;{{cite journal

===Dyslexia in alphabetic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Alphabet|Managing dyslexia: alphabetic orthography}}
Most of the current research on dyslexia focuses on alphabetic orthography.&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

Alphabetic writing systems vary significantly in the depth of their orthography. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are considered deep orthographies in comparison to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which are [[Orthography#Defectiveness|shallow orthographies]]. A deep orthography like English has letters or letter combinations that do not reliably map to specific phonemes/sound units, and so are ambiguous in terms of the sounds that they represent whereas a transparent or shallow orthography has symbols that (more) uniquely map to sounds, ideally in a one-to-one correspondence or at least with limited or clearly signified (as with accent marks or other distinguishing features) variation. Literacy studies have shown that even for children without reading difficulties like dyslexia, a more transparent orthography is learned more quickly and more easily; this is true across language systems (syllabic, alphabetic, and logographic), and between shallow and deep alphabetic languages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In cross-language studies, Aro and Wimmer report differences in developmental reading skills across several alphabetic orthographies.  Among those tested, [[English language|English]] children achieved only 50% accuracy in [[pseudoword]] testing by the end of first grade and did not attain high accuracy until fourth grade. However, in the same test, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] children all achieved scores approaching 85% and 90% in Grade 1 and Grade 4, respectively.&lt;ref name="Aro"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research provides evidence that orthographic irregularities, such as the "complex grapheme-phoneme relations" found in English, present significant difficulties in the reading development of children.&lt;ref name="Aro" /&gt;

However, there is little evidence that a more "regular" orthographic system would significantly diminish the amount of dyslexia cases. Because there is also a visual aspect to dyslexia, affected children often show symptoms such as mirror letter reversal (e.g. confusing "b" and "d"), which can manifest in any language regardless of orthographic depth.

===Dyslexia in logographic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Logogram}}
Logographic writing systems (such as [[Chinese character]]s and [[Cuneiform]]) are significantly different from alphabetic ones. The primary difference is that their basic [[grapheme]]s are [[logogram]]s, a representation based on meaning ([[morpheme]]s), rather than sounds ([[phoneme]]s). Chinese and Japanese Kanji, two languages with logographic orthographies, use sets of one or more characters to represent morphemes. In kanji, there are usually two ways to read a symbol, one that is similar to the original Chinese and one that is for the Japanese word. There are also a greater number of characters for logographic systems like kanji than for alphabetic and syllabic systems (generally): "The Japanese educational system explicitly teaches a set of 1,945 Joyo Kanji (kanji for daily use). However...most Japanese know many more than these and that 3,000 or more kanji are required to read a daily newspaper."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan sized.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Archaic Chinese logograms]]

Development of reading and writing skills in logographic systems depends more heavily on visual memorization than for alphabetic systems.  Thus dyslexics, who often rely on grapheme memorization to cope with phonological awareness deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neural Systems in Dyslexics More Tuned to Memory than to Sound|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/PRNT_Research.html|work=The Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaywitz|first2= B.

====Chinese orthographies====
Chinese children can exhibit a more severe form of dyslexia as opposed to those learning literacy using an alphabetic script such as that used in writing English. Not only are they phonologically at a disadvantage, but their visuospatial processing is impaired. When children have a visuospatial disorder, their visual system when looking at Chinese characters will not activate the semantic information to understand what they are reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siok|last2=Spinks|first2=John A.|last3=Jin|first3=Zhen|last4=Tan|first4=Li Hai|date=13 October 2009|title=Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the co-existence of visuospatial and phonological disorders in Chinese children|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209015498|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=19|pages=R890|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.014|issn=0960-9822|pmid=19825347|access-date=|via=|accessdate=30 July 2013|first1=Wai Ting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alphabetic languages, phonological awareness plays a central role in reading acquisition; in learning to read Chinese, phonological awareness is much less important. Rather, reading in Chinese is strongly related to a child's writing skills, which depend on orthographic awareness and on motor memory.  In handling alphabetic languages with [[deep orthography|deep orthographies]], the child must cope with having more than one spelling to represent a sound.  In spoken Chinese, a single syllable is used in many different words, and a Chinese child must cope with having many written characters that represent the same syllable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further complicating the Chinese writing system, the Chinese character is made up of strokes and sub-character components, substantially increasing visual complexity. Thus orthographic processing is an important aspect of reading. Deficient orthography-to-meaning mapping can lead to reading disability. A key strategy in teaching children to read is to have children repeatedly write samples of single characters, thus building the child's awareness of a character's internal structure (orthographic awareness).&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;

Rapid naming is one of the best single predictors of dyslexia in all languages tested, including both alphabetic and character-based writing systems.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf2"&gt;Wolf, Maryanne (2007). Proust and the squid.

===Dyslexia in syllabic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Syllabary}}

In a syllabary,  written characters represent spoken syllables, whereas alphabetic systems use characters/letters to represent separate phonemes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Nick |last2=Natsume |first2=Miwa |last3=Stavropoulou |first3=Katerina |last4=Hoxhallari |first4=Lorenc |last5=Van Daal |first5=Victor|last6=Polyzoe |first6=Nicoletta |last7=Tsipa |first7=Maria-Louisa |last8= Petalas |first8=Michalis |title=The effects of orthographic depth on learning to read alphabetic, syllabic, and logographic scripts|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|year=2004|volume=39|issue=4|pages=438–68 |doi=10.1598/RRQ.39.4.5 |jstor=4151742}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol in a syllabary typically has the canonical shape of a consonant-vowel (CV) combination. In the Japanese syllabaries, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], there is a nearly one-to-one correspondence between [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] and characters. The transparency of these syllabaries is the reason for their use in first teaching Japanese children to read before advancing to the complex logographic system of kanji, and by the age of five, prior to any official reading education, 89% of Japanese children can read the majority (60 or more out of 71) of hiragana characters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Syllabary orthographies, like English orthography, can also be very irregular. {{clarify|reason=In which language?|date=May 2015|text=A symbol could mean "i" in one sentence but the same symbol could mean "e" in a different sentence if it is preceded by a different symbol,}}&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, M.

However, little research has been done on how dyslexia presents in syllabic systems. One possible reason for this is that because of the different ways that dyslexia can present, {{clarify|date=May 2015|text=(i.e. how visuospatial systems are affected in Chinese dyslexics - or how the logographic system is affected by defects/abnormalities in the visuospatial processing regions, which is more likely since written language is a cultural artifact with no genetic predispositions, and so existing structures must be adapted to handle language)}} the disorder may go unnoticed or not be recognized. On the other hand, a Japanese psychologist {{who|date=May 2015}}  wrote that "while dyslexia, reading disability, reading disorder, reading retardation, or whatever you prefer to call it, comprises a formidable portion of psychiatric practice in Western countries, its incidence in Japan is so rare that specialists in Japan do not get any referrals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Harold W. |last1=Stevenson |first2=James W. |last2=Stigler |first3=G.

A literacy study on children without reading disabilities found that syllabic scripts like Japanese katakana and hiragana, which are very transparent orthographically, are learned more quickly and with better proficiency than more orthographically opaque languages, followed in ease of use and learning by shallow alphabetic scripts that also have many phonological cues, then by complex alphabetic scripts that have irregular orthography (like English), and then by logographic scripts like [[kanji]] which have no phonological cues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:undefined|thumbnail|Two twenty-something's disconnecting from reality.]] --&gt;
In [[popular psychology]], a '''quarter-life crisis''' is a [[crisis]] "involving anxiety over the direction and quality of one's life" which is most commonly experienced in a period ranging from a person's twenties up to their mid-thirties&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/quarterlife-crisis Quarterlife crisis]. ''Collins English Dictionary''. Retrieved 3 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.self.com/wellness/health/2013/03/how-to-survive-quarter-life-crisis/|title=How to Survive a Quarter-Life Crisis|author=Jessica Girdwain|work=SELF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although it can begin as early as 18).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/quarter-life-crisis-age-most-likely-job-work-relationships-linkedin-career-house-money-a8054616.html The age you're most likely to have a quarter-life crisis]. ''The Independent.'' Author - Rachel Hosie. Published 15 November 2017. Retrieved 3 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined by clinical psychologist Alex Fowke as “a period of insecurity, doubt and disappointment surrounding your career, relationships and financial situation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Aspects==
According to Merideth Goldstein of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''quarter-life crisis'' occurs in one's twenties, after entering the "real world" (i.e., after graduating college, and/or after moving out of the family home).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/09/08/the_quarter_life_crisis |title= The quarter-life crisis |work= [[The Boston Globe]] |first= Meredith |last= Goldstein |date= September 8, 2004 |accessdate= 2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; German psychologist [[Erik H. Erikson]], who proposed eight crises that humans face during their development, proposed the existence of a life crisis occurring at this age. The conflict he associated with young adulthood is the ''Intimacy vs. Isolation'' crisis. According to Erikson after establishing a personal identity in adolescence, young adults seek to form intense, usually [[romantic relationship|romantic]] relationships with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erikson |first=Erik H. |title=Identity: Youth and Crisis |location=New York |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=1968 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common symptoms of a quarter-life crisis are often feelings of being "lost, scared, lonely or confused" about what steps to take in early adulthood. Studies have shown that unemployment and choosing a career path is a major cause for young adults to undergo stress or anxiety. Early stages of one living on their own for the first time and learning to cope without parental help can also induce feelings of isolation and loneliness. Re-evaluation of one's close personal relationships can also be a factor, with sufferers feeling they have outgrown their partner or believing others may be more suitable for them.

Recently, [[millennials]] are sometimes referred to as the ''Boomerang Generation'' or ''Peter Pan Generation'', because of the members' perceived penchant for delaying some rites of passage into adulthood for longer periods than previous generations. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members returning home after college and/or living with their parents for longer periods than previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaputis |first=Kathleen |title=The Crowded Nest Syndrome : Surviving the Return of Adult Children |location=Olympia |publisher=Clutter Fairy |year=2003 |isbn=0972672702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies might also be partly explained by changes in external social factors rather than characteristics intrinsic to milennials (e.g., higher levels of [[student loan]] debt in the US among milennials when compared to earlier generations can make it more difficult for young adults to achieve traditional markers of independence such as marriage, home ownership or investing).&lt;ref&gt;Tom Anderson. [https://www.nbcnews.com/better/money/debt-locked-student-loans-force-millennials-delay-life-milestones-n404636 Debt-Locked: Student Loans Force Millennials to Delay Life Milestones] NBC News.com, accessed 03 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lou Carlozo (May 9, 2016).

US News &amp; World Report, accessed 03 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
The notion of the quarter-life crisis is explored by the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', one of the first film depictions of this issue. Other notable films that also do so are ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]''; ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]''; ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]''; ''[[How to Be]]''; ''[[Reality Bites]]''; ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''; ''[[Accepted (film)|Accepted]]''; ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]''; ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]''; ''[[(500) Days of Summer]]''; ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]''; ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]''; ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]''; and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''; as well as the musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'', in the television show ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'',  and the HBO television series ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''. The 2008 web series ''[[Quarterlife]]'' was so named for the phenomenon. Other movies exploring the quarter-life crisis include: ''[[Tiny Furniture]]'', ''[[The Puffy Chair]]'', ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'', ''[[Greenberg (film)|Greenberg]]'', ''[[Frances Ha]]'' and ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''. A 2014 comedy directed by Lynn Shelton titled ''[[Laggies]]'' lightheartedly delves into the complexities of a quarter-life crisis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theconfusedmillennial.com/quarter-life-crisis-movies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
The 2003 [[John Mayer]] single "[[Why Georgia]]" explores the concept of a quarter-life crisis. The song was based upon John Mayer's experiences during this age period, when he moved to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/bt/172/coverstory.html|title=Berklee Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1975 [[Fleetwood Mac]] song "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]", written by [[Stevie Nicks]] in her late twenties, explores many of the self-doubts and fears of the quarter-life crisis, at a time when Nicks professed to be uncertain about her musical career and her romantic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2083|title=Landslide by Fleetwood Mac Songfacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English indie rock band [[Spector (band)|Spector]]'s song "True Love (For Now)", the opening track to their 2012 album ''[[Enjoy It While It Lasts]]'', references a quarter-life crisis.

"20 Something", the final track on ''[[SZA (singer)|SZA]]''{{'}}s 2017 album [[Ctrl (SZA album)|Ctrl]], delves into the many insecurities she experienced in her twenties, both personal and professional, and the urgency she felt to make the most of her life before entering into mature adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/12132246|title=20 Something, SZA|publisher=Genius Media Group, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre''', is located on the southern shore of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]. It is a large centre with more than 200 interactive exhibits relating to [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]]. It has many science programs that are devoted to inspiring the children of Australia to love science.

== History ==
Questacon is an interactive science centre that opened in September 1988. It was developed by Professor Mike Gore, a physics lecturer from the [[Australian National University]]. Professor Gore went on to become the founding Director of Questacon.

Questacon's current building was [[Japan|Japan's]] present to Australia for the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] and it was opened on 23 November 1988. Japanese government and business contributed ¥1 billion, half of the capital cost of A$19.64 million.&lt;ref name="questacon+japan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questacon.edu.au/japan|title=Questacon and Japan|publisher=Questacon.edu.au|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questacon was formerly housed at the old Ainslie Primary School.

As of 3 December 2007,&lt;ref name="www.australia.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.australia.gov.au/Government_Sites_by_Portfolio#InnovationIndustryScienceandResearch]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725023940/http://www.australia.gov.au/Government_Sites_by_Portfolio#InnovationIndustryScienceandResearch |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Questacon is a part of the Australian Government Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research [http://www.industry.gov.au (DIISR)]. The director is Professor Graham Durant. Questacon's vision is "a better future for all Australians through engagement with science and innovation".&lt;ref name="questacon_2005-06_review"&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/assets/pdf/review_2005-06.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830100747/http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/assets/pdf/review_2005-06.pdf |date=30 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday 18 September 2008 a [https://web.archive.org/web/20090227052631/http://www.innovation.gov.au/General/Corp-MC/Documents/SteppingUponline.pdf review of Questacon] was released.&lt;ref name="Innovation release"&gt;[http://www.innovation.gov.au/General/Corp-MC/Pages/REVIEWOFQUESTACONREPORT.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519012540/http://www.innovation.gov.au/General/Corp-MC/Pages/REVIEWOFQUESTACONREPORT.aspx |date=19 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was commissioned by Minister [[Kim Carr]] and chaired by John Simpson of [[National Australia Bank]]. Among other recommendations, the review calls for Questacon to be established as a [[statutory authority]].

=== Science theatre ===
The Centre also features a number of performance spaces, used for presentations for general public and student audiences by Questacon's in-house theatre troupe, the "Excited Particles". The Excited Particles also perform puppet shows for young children.

=== Nkrypt ===
''Nkrypt'' is a sculpture installation outside the Questacon building that consists of eight laser etched stainless steel poles that each carry an encoded message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questacon.edu.au/nkrypt/|title=NKRYPT|publisher=Questacon.edu.au|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outdoor exhibit was installed as a part of the Centenary of [[Canberra]] and a prize is offered to the first person to solve the puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/737/questacon-centenary-code-challenge/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104051822/http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/737/questacon-centenary-code-challenge/ |date=4 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
Questacon is open from 9am to 5pm.

The ''Q Shop'' offers a range of educational science toys, books and teacher resources. Questacon's cafe is situated in the foyer of the building. An entry fee is not required to visit either the cafe or the ''Q Shop''. There are toilets throughout the building, including a children's toilet in the ''Mini Q'' exhibition. There are two dedicated baby change rooms - one near the café in the foyer and another in ''Mini Q''.

==Questacon Technology Learning Centre==
The Questacon Technology Learning Centre is located at the [[Royal Australian Mint]]'s former administration building in Deakin and houses more than 80 staff. All of the outreach programs and the exhibition developers, including researchers, designers and electronics, metal and wood shop staff are based there. There are also an exhibition area and spaces for booked technology workshops and holiday programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221949/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/inventive-technology-in-mint-condition-20121228-2bzel.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach programs ==
In addition to the exhibitions in Canberra, Questacon runs the ''Shell Questacon Science Circus'' and ''Q2U''. Past outreach programs run by Questacon include the ''[[Tenix]] Questacon Maths Squad'', ''Questacon Smart Moves'', ''Questacon Science Play'', ''Questacon Science Squad'' and a range of activities in remote Indigenous communities.

Questacon's common advertising slogan is "The smarter way to have fun."

=== Questacon Science Circus===
The ''Shell Questacon Science Circus'' is an outreach program of Questacon and is the most extensive science outreach program of its kind in the world. Each year, the ''Science Circus'' engages with more than 100,000 people, travels 25,000 kilometers, runs professional development courses for 600 teachers and visits about 30 remote [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] communities as well as [[hospitals]], [[nursing homes]] and [[special school]]s.

The '' Questacon Science Circus'' is a partnership between Questacon, the [[Shell Oil Company]] Australia and the [[Australian National University]]. The ''Science Circus'' won the Prime Minister's Award for Community Business Partnerships in 2006.
Fifteen or sixteen science graduates staff the ''Science Circus'' as it travels, bringing lively presentations of science to towns and schools. The ''Science Circus'' also supports the teaching of science and technology by running practical and fun professional development workshops for teachers. While working for the ''Science Circus'', each presenter also completes a Masters of Science Communication Outreach through the [http://info.anu.edu.au/cpas/ Centre for the Public Awareness of Science] at the [[Australian National University]]. Coursework includes studies in print media, programme evaluation and exhibition design.

Every year the ''Science Circus'' presenters graduate from the course and a new team are selected. The first team graduated in 1988 and there are now over 300 ''Science Circus'' graduates. Graduates have contributed to programmes on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio, the [[Diffusion Science Radio Show]],  [[Cosmos Magazine]], and the [[Mr Science Show]] podcast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10225">A '''reference dose''' is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s maximum acceptable oral [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] of a [[toxic]] substance. Reference doses are most commonly determined for [[pesticide]]s. The EPA defines an oral reference dose (abbreviated '''RfD''') as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]n estimate, with uncertainty spanning perhaps an [[order of magnitude]], of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/glossariesandkeywordlists/search.do?details=&amp;glossaryName=IRIS%20Glossary IRIS Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Regulatory status==
Unlike [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]], RfDs are not enforceable standards. Instead, the EPA uses RfDs as [[risk assessment]] benchmarks and tries to set other regulations so that people are not exposed to chemicals in amounts that exceed RfDs. According to the EPA, "[a]n aggregate daily exposure to a [chemical] at or below the RfD (expressed as 100 percent or less of the RfD) is generally considered acceptable by EPA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/0328red.pdf Reregistration Eligibility Decision for 1,3-Dichloropropene]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the EPA set an acute RfD for children of 0.0015&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day for the [[organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] [[endosulfan]], based on neurological effects observed in test animals. The EPA then looked at dietary exposure to endosulfan, and found that for the most exposed 0.1% of children age 1–6, their daily consumption of the endosulfan exceeded this RfD. To remedy this, the EPA revoked the use of endosulfan on the crops that contributed the most to exposure of children: certain beans, peas, spinach, and grapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/endosulfan_red.pdf Reregistration Eliligibility Decision for Endosulfan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Reference doses are chemical-specific, ''i.e.'' the EPA determines a unique reference dose for every substance it evaluates. Often separate [[Acute (medical)|acute]] and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] RfDs are determined for the same substance. Reference doses are specific to dietary exposure. When assessing inhalation exposure, EPA uses "reference concentrations" ('''RfC'''s), instead of RfDs. Note that RfDs apply only to non-cancer effects. When evaluating [[carcinogen]]ic effects, the EPA uses the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* method.

==Determination==
RfDs are usually derived from animal studies. Animals (typically [[rat]]s) are dosed with varying amounts of the substance in question, and the largest dose at which no effects are observed is identified. This dose level is called the "No observable effect level," or NOEL. To account for the fact that humans may be more or less sensitive than the test animal, a 10-fold uncertainty factor is usually applied to the NOEL. This uncertainty factor is called the "interspecies uncertainty factor" or Uf&lt;sub&gt;inter&lt;/sub&gt;. An additional 10-fold uncertainty factor, the "intraspecies uncertainty factor" or Uf&lt;sub&gt;intra&lt;/sub&gt;, is usually applied to account for the fact that some humans may be substantially more sensitive to the effects of substances than others. Additional uncertainty factors may also be applied. In general:

:&lt;math&gt;RfD (mg/kg/day) = {NOEL (mg/kg/day) \over Uf_{inter} * Uf_{intra} * Uf_{other}}&lt;/math&gt;

Frequently, a "[[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]" or NOAEL is used in place of a NOEL. If adverse effects are observed at all dose levels tested, then the smallest dose tested, the "[[lowest-observed-adverse-effect level]]" or LOAEL, is used to calculate the RfD. An additional uncertainty factor usually applied in these cases, since the NOAEL, by definition, would be lower than the LOAEL had it been observed. If studies using [[human subject research|human subjects]] are used to determine a RfD, then the interspecies uncertainty factor can be reduced to 1, but generally the 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor is retained. Such studies are rare.

==Example==
As an example, consider the following determination of the RfD for the insecticide [[chlorpyrifos]], adapted from the EPA's Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for chlorpyrifos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/chlorpyrifos_ired.pdf Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for Chlorpyrifos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA determined the '''acute RfD''' to be 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day based on a study in which male rats were administered a one-time dose of chlorpyrifos and blood [[cholinesterase]] activity was monitored. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, the lowest of which was 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. This level was thus identified at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). A NOAEL of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg was estimated by dividing the LOAEL by a three-fold uncertainty factor. The NOAEL was then divided by the standard 10-fold inter- and 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factors to arrive at the RfD of 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day. Other studies showed that fetuses and children are even more sensitive to chlorpyrifos than adults, so the EPA applies an additional ten-fold uncertainty factor to protect that subpopulation. A RfD that has been divided by an additional uncertainty factor that only applies to certain populations is called a "population adjusted dose" or PAD. For chlorpyrifos, the acute PAD (or "aPAD") is thus 5×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day, and it applies to infants, children, and women who are breast feeding.

The EPA also determined a '''chronic RfD''' for chlorpyrifos exposure based on studies in which animals were administered low doses of the pesticide for two years. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, and a NOAEL of 0.03&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day estimated by dividing a LOAEL of 0.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day by an uncertainty factor of 10. As with the acute RfD, the chronic RfD of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day was determined by dividing this NOAEL by the inter- and intraspecies uncertainty factors. The chronic PAD ("cPAD") of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day was determined by applying an additional 10-fold uncertainty factor to account for the increased susceptibility of infants and children. Like the aPAD, this cPAD applies to infants, children, and breast feeding women.

==Consensus==
Because the RfD assumes "a dose below which no adverse noncarcinogenic health effects should result from a lifetime of exposure",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/uic/class5/pdf/study_uic-class5_classvstudy_mcl-ha_appd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the critical step in all chemical risk and regulatory threshold calculations is dependent upon a properly derived dose at which no observed adverse effects (NOAEL) were seen which is then divided by an uncertainty factor that considers inadequacies of the study, animal-to-human extrapolation, sensitive sub-populations, and inadequacies of the database.  The RfD that is derived is not always agreed upon.  Some may believe it to be overly protective while others may contend that it is not adequately protective of human health.

For example, the EPA completed its draft toxicological review of perchlorate in 2002 and proposed an RfD of 0.00003 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) based primarily on studies that identified neurodevelopmental deficits in rat pups. These deficits were linked to maternal exposure to perchlorate. Subsequently, the National Academy of Science (NAS) reviewed the health implications of perchlorate, and in 2005 proposed an alternative reference dose of 0.0007&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day based primarily on a 2002 study by Greer et al.&lt;ref&gt;Greer M A, Goodman G, Pleus R C, and S E Greer. (2002) Health Effects Assessment for Environmental Perchlorate Contamination: The Dose Response for Inhibition of Thyroidal Radioiodine Uptake in Humans. Environmental Health Perspectives (110)9: 927-37.&lt;/ref&gt; During that study, 37 human subjects were split into four exposure groups exposed to 0.007 (7 subjects), 0.02 (10 subjects), 0.1 (10 subjects), and 0.5 (10 subjects) mg/kg/day. Significant decreases in iodide uptake were found in the three highest exposure groups. Iodide uptake was not significantly reduced in the lowest exposed group, but four of the seven subjects in this group experienced inhibited iodide uptake. The RfD proposed by NAS was accepted by EPA and added to its integrated risk information system (IRIS) in 2005.

Ginsberg and Rice, in a commentary submitted to the journal ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' (EHP), argued that the 2005 NAS RfD was not protective of human health based on the following:

# The NAS report described the level of lowest exposure from Greer ''et al'' as a NOEL. However, there was actually an effect at that level although not statistically significant largely due to small size of study population (four of seven subjects showed a slight decrease in iodide uptake).
# Reduced iodide uptake was not considered to be an adverse effect. However, it is a precursor to an adverse effect (hypothyroidism). Therefore, additional safety factors, they argued, are necessary when extrapolating from the point of departure to the RfD.
# Consideration of data uncertainty was insufficient because the Greer, et al. study reflected only a 14-day exposure to healthy adults and no additional safety factors were considered to protect sensitive subpopulations. For example, the potential for greater toxicity to breastfeeding newborns was not considered.

Although there has generally been consensus with the Greer ''et al'' study, there is not consensus with regard to developing a perchlorate RfD. One of the key differences results from how the point of departure is viewed (i.e., NOEL or LOAEL), or whether a benchmark dose should be used to derive the RfD. Defining the point of departure as a NOEL or LOAEL has implications when it comes to applying appropriate safety factors to the point of departure to derive the RfD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/region10/pdf/sites/euclid/eroad-perchlorate-memo-071307.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought''''' is a 2001 book by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Pascal Boyer]], in which the author discusses the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] and [[evolutionary origin of religions]].

==Synopsis==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's [[cognitive]] [[inference]] systems, comparable to [[pareidolia]] and [[perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] resulting from [[face perception]] processes within the [[human brain]]. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including [[biological anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[information processing]].

''Religion Explained'' frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent [[cognitive neuroscience]] research in the [[modularity of mind]]. This theory involves cognitive "modules" ("devices" or "subroutines") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in "supernatural agents" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from [[agent detection]]: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. "When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is."&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:144,&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer cites [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s classic [[Zande people|Zande]] story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:196, cf. 2001:12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a "parasite" (or "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the [[Reading (process)|reading]] process is parasitic upon [[language module]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is ''not'' a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of ''aggregate relevance'' – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:298, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
{{summarize section|date=January 2011}}
Critical reception of ''Religion Explained'' has been mixed.

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], a professor of developmental psychology at the [[University of Haifa]], called the book "a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/boyer.html Book Review: Religion Explained] ''Human Nature Review'' 2002 Volume 2: 308–309 (22 July)&lt;/ref&gt; 
He continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study "spirituality" or teach "religion and science". This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Klinghoffer]], a journalist and [[intelligent design]] proponent, wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that "Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic" and describes his work as "professorial noodlings" that attempt to raise the question whether "all religions are somehow the same". He further claims that "debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421220616/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_53/ai_78692094/pg_2 Faith no more—Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought—Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], described Boyer's book as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 2001. ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', 2nd ed., Macmillan, p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the [[University of Bonn]], wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, ''Religion explained'' is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer's account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schön. [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/2002/reviews/rev_schoen_2002.pdf "''Religion Explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought''"], ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' 2002 7.1:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Garry Runciman]], sociologist at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], asked "Are we hardwired for God?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Runciman. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/07/londonreviewofbooks/print Are we hardwired for God?], ''London Review of Books'', July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and economist [[Zachary Karabell]] found stylistic faults. "Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable." He concludes, "Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing."&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Karabell. [http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf A True Believer in Science Offers a Lopsided Look at Faith; ''RELIGION EXPLAINED: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', By Pascal Boyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191026/http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'' June 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comparative religion]] author [[Karen Armstrong]] reviewed Boyer's thesis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer's description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, [http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/200109/0070.html ''Religion Explained'' by Pascal Boyer], ''The Times'', August 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], formerly [[Archbishop of York]], wrote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His "explanation" of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.&lt;ref&gt;John Habgood, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166258&amp;sectioncode=40 "Parasite of airy nothings?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Science Communication – schematic overview.png|thumb|Schematic overview of the field and the actors of science communication according to Carsten Könneker]]
'''Science communication''' is the public [[communication]] of science-related topics to non-experts. This often involves professional scientists (called "[[science outreach|outreach]]" or "[[Popularization of science|popularization]]"), but has also evolved into a [[popular science|professional field]] in its own right. It includes science exhibitions, [[Science journalism|journalism]], [[Science policy|policy]] or media production. Science communication also includes communication between scientists (for instance through [[scientific journals]]), as well as between scientists and non-scientists (especially during public controversies over science and in [[citizen science]] initiatives).
 
Science communication may generate support for [[Scientific method|scientific research]] or [[Science education|study]], or to inform [[decision making]], including [[political]] and [[ethical]] thinking. There is increasing emphasis on explaining methods rather than simply findings of science. This may be especially critical in addressing scientific [[misinformation]], which spreads easily because it is not subject to the constraints of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hilgartner/&gt;&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;
'''Science communicators'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; can use [[entertainment]] and [[persuasion]] including [[humour]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[storytelling]] and [[metaphors]].&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt; Scientists can be trained in some of the techniques used by [[actors]] to improve their communication.&lt;ref name=Viola/&gt;

==Motivations==
Partly due to a market for professional training, science communication is also an academic discipline. Journals include ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'' and ''Science Communication''. Researchers in this field are often linked to [[Science and Technology Studies]], but may also come from [[history of science]], mainstream [[media studies]], [[psychology]] or [[sociology]]. As a reflection of growth in this field, academic departments, such as the ''Department of Life Sciences Communication'' at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], have been established to focus on applied and theoretical communication issues. [[Agricultural communication]] is considered a subset of science communication from an academic and professional standpoint relating to agriculture-related information among agricultural and non-agricultural stakeholders. [[Health communication]] is a related discipline.
Writing in 1987, Geoffery Thomas and John Durant advocated various reasons to increase public understanding of science, or [[scientific literacy]]. If the public enjoyed science more, they suggested there would presumably be more funding, progressive regulation, and trained scientists. More trained engineers and scientists could allow a nation to be more competitive economically.&lt;ref name=GregMiller&gt;As summarised in Gregory, Jane &amp; Steve Miller (1998) Science in Public: communication, culture and credibility (New York: Plenum), 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Science can also benefit individuals. Science can simply have aesthetic appeal (e.g. [[popular science]] or [[science fiction]]). Living in an increasingly technological society, background scientific knowledge can help to negotiate it. The [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] is an example of a field whose research can have direct and obvious implications for individuals.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;
Governments and societies might also benefit from more scientific literacy, since an informed electorate promotes a more [[democratic society]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt; Moreover, science can inform moral [[decision making]] (e.g. answering questions about whether [[Pain in animals|animals can feel pain]], how [[Climate change|human activity influences climate]], or even a [[science of morality]]).
[[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] points out potential pitfalls in improving scientific literacy. He explains first that we must avoid 'scientific idolatry'. In other words, science education must allow the public to respect science without worshiping it, or expecting infallibility. Ultimately scientists are humans, and neither perfectly altruistic, nor perfectly competent. Science communicators must also appreciate the distinction between understanding science and possessing a transferable skill of scientific thinking. Indeed, even trained scientists do not always manage to transfer the skill to other areas of their life.

Communicating science to the public is increasingly important in today's society. However according to some research, some scientists do not have the skills necessary to do so effectively. There has been some research done over why this is, and it has been found that the stereotype of scientists is the main reason they will not communicate to the public often. The "Draw a Scientist" experiment proves that from a young age, most people assume that scientists are unsocial, so scientists use that as a reason to not communicate.

Cohen is critical of what has been called "[[Scientism]]" – the claim that science is the best or only way to solve all problems. He also criticizes the teaching of 'miscellaneous information' and doubts that much of it will ever be of any use, (e.g. the distance in light years from the Earth to various stars, or the names of minerals). Much of scientific knowledge, particularly if it is not the subject of public debate and policy revision, may never really translate to practical changes for the lives of the learners.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;

Many criticisms of academic research in [[public understanding of science]] come from scholars in [[Science and Technology Studies]]. For example, Steven Hilgartner (1990)&lt;ref name=Hilgartner&gt;Hilgartner, Stephen (1990) ‘The Dominant View of Popularization: Conceptual Problems, Political Uses, Social Studies of Science, vol. 20(3): 519-539.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that what he calls 'the dominant view' of science popularization tends to imply a tight boundary around those who can articulate true, reliable knowledge. By defining a [[deficit model|deficient public]] as recipients of knowledge, the scientists get to contrast their own identity as experts. The process of popularization is a form of boundary work. Understood in this way, science communication may explicitly exist to connect scientists with the rest of society, but its very existence only acts to emphasise it: as if the scientific community only invited the public to play in order to reinforce its most powerful boundary (according to work by [[Massimiano Bucchi]] or [[Brian Wynne]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimiano Bucchi]] (1998) Science and the Media (London &amp; New York: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Brian (1992) ‘Misunderstood misunderstanding: Social identities and public uptake of science’, ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 1 (3): 281-304. See also Irwin, Alan &amp; Wynne, Brian (eds) (1996) ''Misunderstanding Science'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[Randy Olson]] adds that anti-science groups can often be so motivated, and so well funded, that the impartiality of science organizations in politics can lead to crises of public understanding of science. He cites examples of [[denialism]] (for instance of [[global warming]]) to support this worry.&lt;ref name=POIOlson&gt;(23 October 2009.) [http://www.pointofinquiry.org/randy_olson_dont_be_such_a_scientist/ "Randy Olson - Don’t Be Such a Scientist."] (Includes podcast). [http://www.pointofinquiry.org Pointofinquiry.org]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] likewise argues that the stories scientists tell are invariably competing with the efforts of people like [[Adnan Oktar]]. Krulwich explains that attractive, easy to read, and cheap [[creationist]] textbooks were sold by the thousands to schools in Turkey (despite their strong secular tradition) due to the efforts of Oktar.&lt;ref name=Krulwich&gt;Miller, Lulu (29 July 2008).[http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2008/jul/29/tell-me-a-story/ "Tell Me a Story."] (Includes podcast). [http://www.radiolab.org Radiolab.org]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Astrobiologist [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] has spoken of repeated disruption of his work by popular anti-scientific phenomena, having been called upon to assuage public fears of an impending [[Nibiru cataclysm|cataclysm]] involving an unseen planetary object—first in 2008, and again in 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selk|first1=Avi|title=Please stop annoying this NASA scientist with your ridiculous Planet X doomsday theories|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/18/please-stop-annoying-this-nasa-scientist-with-your-ridiculous-planet-x-doomsday-theories/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Physicsworks.ogv|thumb|[[Walter Lewin]] demonstrates conservation of potential energy. It can be difficult to captivatingly share good scientific thinking as well as scientifically accurate information. Krulwich and Olson believe scientists must rise to that challenge using metaphor and story telling.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;]]

Marine biologist and film-maker [[Randy Olson]] published ''Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style''. In the book he describes how there has been this unproductive negligence when it comes to teaching scientists to communicate. ''Don't be Such a Scientist'' is written to his fellow scientists, and he says they need to "lighten up". He adds that scientists are ultimately the most responsible for promoting and explaining science to the public and media. This, Olson says, should be done according to a good grasp of [[social science]]; scientists must use [[persuasive]] and effective means like [[story telling]]. Olson acknowledges that the stories told by scientists need not only be compelling but also accurate to modern science - and says this added challenge must simply be confronted. He points to figures like [[Carl Sagan]] as effective popularizers, partly because such figures actively cultivate a likeable image.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;

Science popularization figures such as Carl Sagan and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson|Neil Degrasse Tyson]] are partly responsible for the view of science or a specific science discipline within the general public. However, the degree of knowledge and experience a science popularizer has can vary greatly. Because of this, some can depend on sensationalism. As a Forbes contributor put it, "The main job of physics popularizers is the same as it is for any celebrity: get more famous."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Neil deGrasse Tyson's Role in the Scientific Community? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/11/what-is-neil-degrasse-tysons-role-in-the-scientific-community/#17afaca875a5 |website=Forbes |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this variation in experience, research scientists can sometimes question the credibility of science popularizers. Another point in the controversy of popular science is the idea of how public debate can affect public opinion. A relevant and highly public example of this is [[climate change]]. A science communication study appearing in the New York Times proves that "even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader’s perception of a [science news] story” and that even “firmly worded (but not uncivil) disagreements between commenters affected readers’ perception of science.”&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes some to worry that the popularizing of science in the public, questioning whether the further popularization of science will cause pressure towards generalization or sensationalism. Unfortunately, this question will fall to time for an answer.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his commencement address to [[Caltech]] students, journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] delivered a speech entitled "Tell me a story". Krulwich says that scientists are actually given many opportunities to explain something interesting about science or their work, and that they must seize such opportunities. He says scientists must resist shunning the public, as [[Sir Isaac Newton]] did in his writing, and instead embrace metaphors the way [[Galileo]] did; Krulwich suggests that metaphors only become more important as the science gets more difficult to understand. He adds that telling stories of science in practice, of scientists' success stories and struggles, helps convey that scientists are real people. Finally, Krulwich advocates for the importance of scientific values in general, and helping the public to understand that scientific views are not mere opinions, but hard-won knowledge.&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;

Actor [[Alan Alda]] helps scientists and PhD students get more comfortable with communication with the help of [[drama]] coaches (they use the acting techniques of [[Viola Spolin]]).&lt;ref name=Viola&gt;Grushkin, Daniel (5 August 2010). [http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57611/ "Try acting like a scientist"] [http://the-scientist.com/ The Scientist Magazine]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Nisbet describes the use of [[Opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagining science's publics===
In the preface of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote: "Three imaginary readers looked over my shoulder while I was writing, and I now dedicate the book to them. [...] First the general reader, the layman [...] second the expert [and] third the student".

[[File:Science &amp; Technology Fair 2011 - Kolkata 2011-02-09 0921.JPG|thumb|Students explain science projects to visitors. Susanna Hornig promotes the message that anyone can meaningfully engage with science, even without going as deeply into it as the researchers themselves do.&lt;ref name=Priest/&gt;]]

Many criticisms of the [[public understanding of science]] movement have emphasized that this thing they were calling the public was somewhat of an (unhelpful) black box. Approaches to the public changed with the move away from the public understanding of science. Science communication researchers and practitioners now often showcase their desire to listen to non-scientists as well as acknowledging an awareness of the fluid and complex nature of (post/late) modern social identities.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see Irwin, Alan &amp; Michael, Mike (2003) Science, Social Theory and Public Knowledge (Maidenhead &amp; Philadelphia: Open University Press). chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, people will use plurals: [[publics]] or audiences. As the editor of [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] put it in a special issue on publics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have clearly moved from the old days of the deficit frame and thinking of publics as monolithic to viewing publics as active, knowledgeable, playing multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping science. (Einsiedel, 2007: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Einsiedel, Edna (2005) ‘Editorial: Of Publics and Science’, Public Understanding of Science, vol. 16(1): 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Einsiedel goes on to suggest both views of the public are "monolithic" in their own way; they both choose to declare what something called the public is. [[Public understanding of science]] might have ridiculed publics for their ignorance, but an alternative "public engagement with science and technology" romanticizes its publics for their participatory instincts, intrinsic morality or simple collective wisdom. As Susanna Hornig Priest (2009)&lt;ref name=Priest&gt;Priest, Susanna Hornig (2009) ‘Reinterpreting the audiences for media messages about science’, in Richard Holliman et al (eds) Investigating Science Communication in the Information Age: Implications for Public Engagement and Popular Media (Oxford: Oxford University Press) 223-236.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes in her recent introduction essay on science’s contemporary audiences, the job of science communication might be to help non-scientists feel they are not excluded as opposed to always included; that they can join in if they want, rather than that there is a necessity to spend their lives engaging.

The process of quantifiably surveying public opinion of science is now largely associated with the [[public understanding of science]] movement (some would say unfairly&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, Jon Miller is the name most associated with such work and well known for differentiating between identifiable ‘attentive’ or ‘interested’ publics (that is to say science fans) and those who do not care much about science and technology. Miller’s work questioned whether the American public had the following four attributes of scientific literacy:
* knowledge of basic textbook scientific factual knowledge
* an understanding of scientific method
* appreciated the positive outcomes of science and technology
* rejected superstitious beliefs, such as astrology or numerology&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, John Durant’s work surveying British public&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Durant, John, GA Evans &amp; GP Thomas (1989) ‘The Public Understanding of Science’, Nature 340: 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; applied similar ideas to Miller. However, they were slightly more concerned with attitudes to science and technology, rather than just how much knowledge people had. They also looked at public confidence in their knowledge, considering issues such as the gender of those ticking "don’t know" boxes. We can see aspects of this approach, as well as a more "public engagement with science and technology" influenced one, reflected within the [[Eurobarometer]] studies of public opinion. These have been running since 1973 to monitor public opinion in the member states, with the aim of helping the preparation of policy (and evaluation of policy). They look at a host of topics, not just science and technology but also defence, the [[euro]], enlargement of the European Union, and culture. Eurobarometer’s recent study of Europeans’ Attitudes to Climate Change&lt;ref&gt;(September 2008.) [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_300_full_en.pdf "Europeans’ attitudes towards climate change."] European Parliament and European Commission (accessed in May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example. It focuses on respondents’ "subjective level of information"; asking "personally, do you think that you are well informed or not about…?" rather than checking what people knew.

===Frame analysis===
Science communication can be analysed through [[frame analysis]], a research method used to analyse how people understand situations and activities.

Some features of this analysis are listed below.
* '''Public accountability''': placing a blame on public actions for value, e.g. political gain in the climate change debate
* '''Runaway technology''': creating a certain view of technological advancements, e.g. photos of an exploded nuclear power plant
* '''Scientific uncertainty''': questioning the reliability of a scientific theory, e.g. arguing how bad global climate change can be if humans are still alive&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Nisbet, Matthew C. (2009). Communicating Climate Change: Why Frames Matter for Public Engagement. Environment (Online at http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/Nisbet-full.html, retrieved 20 October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heuristics ===
People make an enormous number of decisions every day, and to approach all of them in a careful, methodical manner is impractical. They therefore often use mental shortcuts known as "[[heuristic]]s" to quickly arrive at acceptable inferences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1991). ''Social Cognition'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] originally proposed three heuristics, listed below, although there are many others that have been discussed in later research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=27 September 1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Representativeness heuristic|'''Representativeness''']]: used to make assumptions about probability based on relevancy, e.g. how likely item A is to be a member of category B (is Kim a chef?), or that event C resulted from process D (could the sequence of coin tosses H-H-T-T have occurred randomly?).
* [[Availability heuristic|'''Availability''']]: used to estimate how frequent or likely an event is based on how quickly one can conjure examples of the event. For example, if one were asked to approximate the number of people in your age group that are currently in college, your judgment would be affected by how many of your own acquaintances are in college.
* [[Anchoring|'''Anchoring and adjustment''']]: used when making judgments with uncertainties. One will start with an anchoring point, then adjust it to reach an assumption. For example, if you are asked to estimate how many people will take Dr. Smith's biology class this spring, you may recall that 38 students took the class in the fall, and adjust your estimation based on whether the class is more popular in the spring or in the fall.
The most effective science communication efforts take into account the role that heuristics play in everyday decision-making. Many outreach initiatives focus solely on increasing the public's knowledge, but studies (e.g. Brossard et al. 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brossard|first=Dominique|last2=Lewenstein|first2=Bruce|last3=Bonney|first3=Rick|date=1 January 2005|title=Scientific knowledge and attitude change: The impact of a citizen science project|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690500069483|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=27|issue=9|pages=1099–1121|doi=10.1080/09500690500069483|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that there is little – if any – correlation between knowledge levels and attitudes towards scientific issues.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, D. A. (2006). Messages and heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies. In J. Turney (Ed.), Engaging science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action (pp. 20-25). London: The Wellcome Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Simulation ====
{{Main|Simulation heuristic}}

The simulation heuristic is used to judge how likely certain outcomes are based on the ease with which one can imagine a particular ending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This heuristic can be used for many tasks, including prediction (Will the Jets win this football game?) and causality (Did Jim eat the last slice of pizza?). An application of this heuristic is to the case of near misses. Consider the following example from Kahneman &amp; Tversky:&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. &amp; Tversky, A. (1981). ''The simulation heuristic''. (Report No. 5). Retrieved from http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA099504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane and Mr. Tees were scheduled to leave the airport on different flights, at the same time. They traveled from town in the same limousine, were caught in a traffic jam, and arrived at the airport thirty minutes after the scheduled departure time of their flights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane is told his flight left on time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Tees is told that his flight was delayed, and just left five minutes ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is more upset?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane or Mr. Tees?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Almost everyone says, "Mr. Tees", because they cannot imagine how Mr. Crane could have caught his flight, while Mr. Tees might have made it if not for that slow pedestrian, or the exceptionally long security line. The simulation heuristic has this ability to generate "if only" conditions, which can be used to understand the negative feelings of frustration, indignation, etc. that arise from near misses such as that of Mr. Tees.

This simulation of how events ''might'' have occurred is referred to as [[counterfactual thinking]], and can be used to try to identify a unique or unusual circumstance that lead to a dramatic outcome.

== Science in popular culture and the media ==

=== Birth of public science ===
While scientific study began to emerge as a popular discourse following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], science was not widely funded or exposed to the public until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.berkeley.edu|publisher=Berkeley University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most science prior to this was funded by individuals under private [[patronage]] and was studied in exclusive groups, like the [[Royal Society]]. [[Public science]] emerged due to a gradual [[Marxism|social change]], resulting from the rise of the middle class in the nineteenth century. As scientific inventions, like the [[conveyor belt]] and the [[steam locomotive]] entered and enhanced the lifestyle of people in the nineteenth century, scientific inventions began to be widely funded by [[University|universities]] and other public institutions in an effort to increase scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science.html|title=Science Technology Timeline|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since scientific achievements were beneficial to society, the pursuit of scientific knowledge resulted in science as a [[profession]]. Scientific institutions, like the [[National Academy of Sciences]] or the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] are examples of leading platforms for the public discussion of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/baas.htm|title=BAAS|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brewster]], founder of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, believed in regulated publications in order to effectively communicate their discoveries, "so that scientific students may know where to begin their labours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/history|title=British Science Association History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.britishscienceassociation.org|publisher=British Science Association|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the communication of science reached a wider audience, due to the [[professionalization]] of science and its introduction to the [[public sphere]], the interest in the subject increased.

=== Scientific media in the 19th century ===
There was a change in media production in the nineteenth century. The invention of the [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] [[printing press]] enabled more pages to be printed per hour, which resulted in cheaper texts. Book prices gradually dropped, which gave the [[working class]]es the ability to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/fyfe.html#audience|title=A Review of Aileen Fyfe's Science and Salvation: Evangelical Popular Science Publishing in Victorian Britain|last=Landow|first=George P.|date=25 May 2005|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer reserved for the elite, affordable and informative texts were made available to a mass audience. Historian Aileen Fyfe noted that, as the nineteenth century experienced a set of [[:Category:19th-century reform movements|social reforms]] that sought to improve the lives of those in the working classes, the availability of public knowledge was valuable for intellectual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=National University of Ireland|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were reform efforts to further the knowledge of the less educated. The [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], led by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], attempted to organize a system for widespread literacy for all classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/59807?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true|title=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (act. 1826–1846)|last=Ashton|first=Rosemary|date=|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, weekly [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], like the ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', were aimed to educate the general public on scientific achievements in a comprehensive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge|title=The Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|last=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|first=|date=2012|website=archive.org|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|left|thumb|[[Friedrich Koenig|Fredrich Koenig]]'s stream powered [[printing press]], 1814.]]
As the audience for scientific texts expanded, the interest in public science did as well. 'Extension lectures' were installed in some universities, like [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], which encouraged members of the public to attend lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=About the University: Nineteenth and twentieth centuries|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Cambridge|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, travelling lectures were a common occurrence in the nineteenth century and attracted hundreds of viewers. These [[public lecture]]s were a part of the [[lyceum movement]] and demonstrated basic [[Experiment|scientific experiments]], which advanced scientific knowledge for both the educated and uneducated viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh.dickinson.edu/digitalmuseum/exhibit-artifact/making-the-invisible-visible/showing-scientific-lecturing-19th-century|title=Showing off: Scientific Lecturing in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=|website=The Dickinsonia History Project|publisher=Dickinson College|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the popularization of [[public science]] enlighten the general public through [[mass media]], but it also enhanced communication within the [[scientific community]]. Although scientists had been communicating their discoveries and achievements through print for centuries, publications with a variety of subjects decreased in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, publications in discipline-specific journals were crucial for a successful career in the sciences in the nineteenth century. As a result, [[scientific journal]]s such as [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] or [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']] possessed a large readership and received substantial funding by the end of the nineteenth century as the popularization of science continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making "Nature": The History of a Scientific Journal|last=Brown|first=Melinda|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0226261454|location=Chicago, USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication of science in contemporary media ===
Science can be communicated to the public in many different ways. According to Karen Bultitude, a science communication lecturer at [[University College London]], these can be broadly categorised into three groups: traditional journalism, live or face-to-face events, and online interaction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|title=The Why and How of Science Communication|last=Bultitude|first=Karen|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813110819/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[journalism]] (for example, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[television]] and [[radio]]) has the advantage of reaching large audiences; in the past, this is way most people regularly accessed information about science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional media is also more likely to produce information that is high quality (well written or presented), as it will have been produced by professional journalists. Traditional journalism is often also responsible for setting agendas and having an impact on government [[policy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The traditional journalistic method of communication is one-way, so there can be no dialogue with the public, and science stories can often be reduced in scope so that there is a limited focus for a mainstream audience, who may not be able to comprehend the bigger picture from a scientific perspective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, there is new research now available on the role of newspapers and television channels in constituting 'scientific public spheres' which enable participation of a wide range of actors in public deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese.2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage of traditional journalism is that, once a science story is taken up by mainstream media, the scientist(s) involved no longer has any direct control over how his or her work is communicated, which may lead to misunderstanding or misinformation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCartney|first=Margaret|date=25 January 2016|title=Margaret McCartney: Who gains from the media’s misrepresentation of science?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i355|journal=BMJ|volume=352|pages=i355|doi=10.1136/bmj.i355|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26810502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area demonstrates how the relationship between journalists and scientists has been strained in some instances.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudo|first=Anthony|date=1 September 2015|title=Scientists, the Media, and the Public Communication of Science|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soc4.12298|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=9|pages=761–775|doi=10.1111/soc4.12298|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand scientists have reported being frustrated with things like journalists oversimplifying or dramatizing of their work, while on the other hand journalists find scientists difficult to work with and ill-equipped to communicate their work to a general audience.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962750268|title=The Oxford handbook of the science of science communication|others=Jamieson, Kathleen Hall,, Kahan, Dan M.,, Scheufele, Dietram,|isbn=9780190497620|location=New York, NY, United States of America|oclc=962750268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Despite this potential tension, a comparison of scientists from several countries has shown that many scientists are pleased with their media interactions and engage often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Hans Peter|last2=Brossard|first2=Dominique|last3=Cheveigné|first3=Suzanne de|last4=Dunwoody|first4=Sharon|last5=Kallfass|first5=Monika|last6=Miller|first6=Steve|last7=Tsuchida|first7=Shoji|date=11 July 2008|title=Interactions with the Mass Media|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5886/204|journal=Science|volume=321|issue=5886|pages=204–205|doi=10.1126/science.1157780|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18625578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note the use of traditional media sources, like [[newspaper]]s and [[television]], has steadily declined as primary sources for science information, while the internet has rapidly increased in prominence.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/|title=S&amp;E Indicators 2018 {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over half of Americans (55 percent) reported using the internet as their primary source to learn about science and technology, compared to 24 percent reporting TV and 4 percent reporting newspapers were their primary sources.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Additionally, traditional media outlets have dramatically decreased the number of, or in some cases eliminated, science journalists and the amount of science-related content they publish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23674|title=Communicating Science Effectively: A Research Agenda|last=Agenda|first=Committee on the Science of Science Communication: A Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Sciences|first3=National Academies of|last4=Engineering|last5=Medicine|first5=and|date=13 December 2016|isbn=9780309451024|doi=10.17226/23674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category is live or face-to-face events, such as public lectures (for example, [http://events.ucl.ac.uk/calendar/tab:lunch_hour_lectures/ UCL's public lunch hour lectures] – [[museum]]s, [[debate]]s, [http://www.sciencemadesimple.co.uk/shows/busking science busking], [http://www.sciartcenter.org/ sci-art], [http://www.sciencecafes.org/ science cafes] and [[science festival]]s. [[Citizen science|Citizen Science]] or crowd-sourced science (scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists), which can be done with a face-to-face approach, online, or as a combination of the two to engage in science communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research has shown that members of the public seek out science information that is entertaining, but also helping citizens to critically participate in risk regulation and S&amp;T governance.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is important to bear this aspect in mind when communicating scientific information to the public (for example, through events combining science communication and comedy, such as [http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/ Festival of the Spoken Nerd] or during scientific controversies).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The advantages of this approach are that it is more personal and allows scientists to interact with the public, allowing for two-way dialogue. Scientists are also better able to control content using this method. Disadvantages of this method include the limited reach, it can also be resource-intensive and costly and also, it may be that only audiences with an existing interest in science will be attracted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The third category is online interaction, for example, [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s and [[podcast]]s can also be used for science communication, as can other [[social media]]. Online methods of communicating science have the potential to reach huge audiences, can allow direct interaction between scientists and the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Könneker|first=Carsten|last2=Lugger|first2=Beatrice |date=4 October 2013|title= Public Science 2.0 – Back to the Future |url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/49 |journal=Science|volume=342|issue= 6154|pages=49–50|doi= 10.1126/science.1245848|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24092719}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content is always accessible and can be somewhat controlled by the scientist. Additionally, online communication of science can help boost scientists' reputation through increased citations, better circulation of articles, and establishing new collaborations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Online communication also allows for both one-way and two-way communication, depending on the audience’s and the author's preferences. However, there are disadvantages in that it is difficult to control how content is picked up by others, and regular attention and updating is needed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When considering whether or not to engage in science communication online, scientists should review what science communication research has shown to be the potential positive and negative outcomes. Online communication has given rise to movements like [[open science]], which advocates for making science more accessible. However, when engaging in communication about science online, scientists should consider not publicizing or reporting findings from their research until it has been peer-reviewed and published, as journals may not accept the work after it has been circulated under the "[[Ingelfinger rule]]".

Other considerations revolve around how scientsts will be perceived by other scientists for engaging in communication. For example, some scholars have criticized engaged, popular scholars using concepts like the [[Sagan effect]] or [[Kardashian Index]]. Despite these criticisms, many scientists are taking to communicating their work on online platforms, a sign of potentially changing norms in the field.[https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40992/title/Science-Gone-Social/]

=== The effects of Twitter and other social media on scientific communication ===
By using [[Twitter]], researchers and academics can discuss and communicate scientific topics with many types of audiences based on various points of view.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608005909/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 June 2018|title=Social Media in Science|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=12 September 2016|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies indicate that the use of Twitter can positively impact the number of times a scientific article is cited. These studies show that articles that are highly tweeted about are eleven times more likely to be highly cited than those that who few people tweeted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2012/01/15/how-could-twitter-influence-science-and-why-scientists-are-on-board/#778c777718be.|title=How Could Twitter Influence Science (And Why Scientists Are on Board)|last=Shaughnessy|first=Haydn|date=17 January 2012|website=Forbes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in studies by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], research has shed light on how Twitter has a direct link to the advances in the science community.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Alison Burt, Editor in chief of Elsevier Connect and author of the article ''How to use social media for science,'' states the potential drawbacks to sharing their research on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-use-social-media-for-science|title=How to use social media for science - 3 views|last=Burt|first=Alison|date=|website=Elsevier|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimberly Collins of [[PLOS]] explains reasons how some scientists are hesitant to join Twitter.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Kimberley|last2=Shiffman|first2=David|last3=Rock|first3=Jenny|date=12 October 2016|title=How Are Scientists Using Social Media in the Workplace?|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0162680|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists are hesitant to use social media outlets such as Twitter due to lack of knowledge of the platform, and inexperience with how to make meaningful posts.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Some scientists do not see the meaning in using Twitter as a platform to share their research or have the time to add the information into the accounts themselves.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

Scientists also believe that Twitter is not professional enough for them to put out information as well as receive relevant suggestions and comments back.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Scientists did give a positive to using Twitter by (28%) of the scientists who participated in the study said communicating science on Twitter can benefit because of the size and diverse audience it reaches.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; BoingBoing science editor and [[The New York Times|New York Times]] columnist [[Maggie Koerth-Baker]] commented on the importance of keeping public and private personas on social media separate in order to maintain professionalism online.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to these findings, posting academic research on a personal social media accounts could potentially send mixed messages to Twitter users.

There have been occasions where scientific outreach on Twitter has been met with positive results. In September 2017, an 8 year old bug lover was teased at her school for her passion for bugs.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/an-8-year-old-bullied-for-her-love-of-bugs-just-got-her-first-scientific-publication|title=An 8-Year-Old Bullied For Her Love of Bugs Just Got Her First Scientific Publication|last=Dean|first=Signe|work=ScienceAlert|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Entomological Society of Canada|Entomological society of Canada]] posting a tweet defending her love for bugs called #BugsR4Girls.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ESC’s use of twitter was able to make a statement saying, "A young girl who loves insects is being bullied &amp; needs our support. DM your email &amp; we'll connect you! #BugsR4Girls".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2017, a study done by the [[Pew Research Center]] of Journalism and Media found that "About a quarter of social media users follow science related pages and accounts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/20/science-news-and-information-today/|title=Science News and Information Today|date=2017-09-20|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group places both more importance and comparatively more trust on science news that comes to them through social media".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Karen Peterson, director of Scientific Career Development at [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson Cancer research Center]] stresses the "importance of using social networks such as [[Facebook]] and Twitter to engage in intercommunication" for establishing an online presence as well.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/features/2014/02/scientists-guide-social-media|title=A scientist's guide to social media|date=14 November 2017|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is necessary for career development. No matter your personality type, career advisors recommend that postdocs use online networking tools to make connections, exchange scientific ideas, and advance a career.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

According to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], "more than 3,000 scientists and engineers told Nature about their awareness of various giant social media networks and research-profiling sites".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Elena Milani created the SciHashtag project which is a condensed collection of Twitter hashtags regarding science communication and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sagepus.blogspot.com/2016/10/scihashtag-twitter-hashtag-science.html|title=SciHashtag: Twitter hashtags for scientists|last=Underst|first=Public|last2=Science|first2=ing of|website=Public Understanding of Science Blog|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter has become a part of researchers’ lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== The public understanding of science movement ==
The [[public understanding of science]], public awareness of science and public engagement with science and technology are all terms coined with a movement involving governments and societies in the late 20th century. During the late 19th century, science became a professional subject and influenced by governmental suggestions. Prior to this, public understanding of science was very low on the agenda. However, some well-known figures such as [[Michael Faraday]] ran lectures aimed at the non-expert public, his being the famous [[Christmas Lectures]] which began in 1825. The 20th century saw groups founded on the basis they could position science in a broader cultural context and allow scientists to communicate their knowledge in a way that could reach and be understood by the general public. In the UK, ''The Bodmer Report'' (or ''The Public Understanding of Science'' as it is more formally known) published in 1985 by [[The Royal Society]] changed the way scientists communicated their work to the public. The report was designed to "review the nature and extent of the public understanding of science in the United Kingdom and its adequacy for an advanced democracy.".&lt;ref name=gregory2000&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in Public|last=Gregory|first=Jane|last2=Miller|first2=Steven|publisher=Ingram Digital|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=5–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by the geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer alongside famous scientists such as broadcaster [[Sir David Attenborough]], the report was evidenced by all of the major sectors concerned; [[scientists]], [[politicians]], [[journalists]] and [[industrialists]] but not the [[Public|general public]].&lt;ref name=gregory2000/&gt; One of the main assumptions drawn from the report was everybody should have some grasp of science and this should be introduced from a young age by teachers who are suitably qualified in the subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Short|first=Daniel|year=2013|title=The public understanding of science: 30 years of the Bodmer Report|journal=The School Science Review|volume=95|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also asked for further [[media coverage]] of science including via [[newspapers]] and [[television]] which has ultimately led to the establishment of platforms such as the [[Vega Science Trust]].

In both the UK and the [[United States]] following the [[second world war]], public views of scientists swayed from great praise to resentment. Therefore, the Bodmer Report highlighted concerns from the scientific community that their withdrawal from society was causing [[scientific research]] funding to be weak.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmer promoted the communication of science to a wider more general public by expressing to British scientists that it was their responsibility to publicise their research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An upshot of the publication of the report was the creation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), a collaboration between the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Institution]]. The engagement between these individual societies caused the necessity for a public understanding of science movement to be taken seriously. COPUS also awarded grants for specific outreach activities allowing the public understanding to come to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodmer|first=Walter|date=20 September 2010|title=Public Understanding of Science: The BA, the Royal Society and COPUS|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/64/Suppl_1/S151|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|volume=64|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S151–S161|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0035|issn=0035-9149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately leading to a cultural shift in the way scientists publicised their work to the wider non-expert community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=Science and Technology; Third Review|last=|first=|date=|website=parliament.uk|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although COPUS no longer exists within the UK the name has been adopted in the US by the [[Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science|Coalition for the Public Understanding of Science]]. An organisation which is funded by the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] and focuses on popular science projects such as science cafes, festivals, magazines and [[citizen science]] schemes.

[[Image:Édouard-Henri Avril (13).jpg|thumb|250px|Sexual penetration occurring in the [[missionary position]], depicted by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]

'''Sexual penetration''' is the insertion of a body part or other object into a [[body orifice]], such as the [[vagina]], [[anus]] or [[mouth]], as part of [[human sexual activity]] or [[animal sexual behavior]].

The term is most commonly used in statute law in the context of proscribing certain sexual activities. Terms such as “[[sexual intercourse]]” or “[[carnal knowledge]]” are more commonly found in older statutes, while many modern criminal statutes use the term “sexual penetration” because it is a broad term encompassing (unless otherwise qualified) any form of penetrative sex, including digital (meaning with the digits, i.e., the fingers) or with an object, and may involve only the most minimal penetration. Some jurisdictions refer to some forms of penetration as "acts of indecency", or other terminology. 

==Definitions==
When a [[Human penis|penis]] is inserted into a woman's vagina, it is generally called vaginal or sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Biology|isbn =0495561819|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|page=314|accessdate=April 30, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=09reWGhFDqUC&amp;pg=PA314|author=Cecie Starr, Beverly McMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual intercourse| publisher=''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate=September 5, 2012|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexual-intercourse}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a penis penetrates another person's anus, it is called [[anal sex]] or anal intercourse.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 978-0-8018-9396-4|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press|JHU Press]]|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|author1 = Barry R.

Carroll|title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|isbn = 978-0-495-60274-3|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2009|pages=270–271|accessdate=December 19, 2010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Penetrative [[oral sex]] may involve penetration of the mouth by a penis ([[fellatio]]) or the use of the tongue to penetrate a woman's vagina or [[vulva]] ([[cunnilingus]]). The tongue may also penetrate the anus during [[anilingus]], which is a form of oral and anal sex. If one or more fingers are used to penetrate an orifice, it is called [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] or digital penetration. The insertion of an object, such as a [[dildo]], [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] or other [[sex toy]], into a person's genital area or anus may also be considered sexual penetration.

==Unlawful==
{{See also|Human sexual activity#Legal issues}}
Penetrative [[sex crimes]] are generally considered more serious than [[non-penetrative sex]] crimes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/sexual_assult_by_penetration/ Guidelines for sentencing, UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115152923/http://cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/sexual_assult_by_penetration/ |date=2013-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual penetration of a child even more so. A child below the statutory [[age of consent]] generally cannot consent to acts involving sexual penetration. In laws, the term ''sexual penetration'' is commonly used in relation to sex with children. Unlawful sexual penetration is generally an offense irrespective of how deep the penetration was and irrespective of whether [[ejaculation]] of semen took place.

Laws may distinguish particular forms of sexual penetration as part of the offense. For example, the law in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] provides:
{{quote|"Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree" is a [[felony]] that occurs where the offender "penetrates the vagina, anus or penis of another with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor", if the victim is "subjected to forcible compulsion", or is "under 12 years of age", or "is incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness"|[https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.411 Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree], Oregon Statutes § 163.411}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], sexually penetrating a relative is an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/sex-with-an-adult-relative Sexual Offences Act 2003] retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of penetration have at times been considered [[Obscenity|obscene]] and been prohibited. Works containing such penetrations may be considered [[pornography]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

'''Spaltklang''' (literally: ''split sound'') is a term in [[music theory]]. It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an [[instrumental piece]]. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound.

Examples of applied Spaltklang can be found in [[New Music]] such as [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s [[Histoire du soldat]]. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]]ed instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the [[string section]], for instance, only [[violin]] and [[double bass]] are represented, while [[viola]] and [[cello]] are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound.

Moreover, the term appears in connection with [[multiphonics]].

The term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of [[organ building]]. Here, it refers to organs that have [[Register (phonology)|registers]] with very different and distinct [[timbres]]. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a [[root note]]. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the [[Renaissance]] period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‘ and 2’ registers but omitting the 4’ register.

In art history, '''speech scroll''' (also called a '''banderole''' or '''phylactery''')&lt;ref name="Petersen2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Petersen|2011|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an illustrative device denoting speech, song, or, in rarer cases, other types of sound.

Developed independently on two continents, the device was in use by artists within [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures from as early as 650 BC until after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century, as well as by European painters during the [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] periods.

While European speech scrolls were drawn as if they were an actual unfurled scroll or strip of [[parchment]], Mesoamerican speech scrolls are merely scroll-''shaped'', looking much like a [[question mark]].

==Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica==
[[File:San Andres Cylinder Seal print 1.svg|right|thumb|300px|A rollout of the [[San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)|San Andrés]] [[cylinder seal]], showing a bird "speaking" the name "3 Ajaw".]]
Speech scrolls are found throughout Mesoamerica.  One of the earliest examples of a Mesoamerican speech scroll was found on an [[Olmec]] [[ceramic]] [[cylinder seal]] dated to approximately 650 BC.  Here two lines issue from a bird's mouth followed by [[glyph (archaeology)|glyphs]] proposed to be "''3 Ajaw''," a ruler's name.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl, Pope, Nagy 2002, pp. 1984–1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The murals of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]] site of [[Teotihuacan]] are filled with speech scrolls, in particular the lively (and unexplained) tableaus found within the [[Tepantitla]] compound -- [[:Image:Tepantitla Mountain Stream mural Teotihuacan (Luis Tello).jpg|this mural]], for example, shows no fewer than 20 speech scrolls.

In Mesoamerica, the speech-scroll is usually oriented with the longest outer edge upward, so that the central element (or "tongue") curves downward as it spirals.  Some Mesoamerican speech scrolls are divided lengthwise with each side a different shade.

[[Glyph (archaeology)|Glyphs]] or similar markings rarely appear on the Mesoamerican speech scroll, although "tabs"—small, triangular or square blocks—are sometimes seen along the outer edge.  If the speech scroll represents a tongue, then the tabs may represent teeth, but their meaning or message, if any, is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, ''Endangered Language Fund''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Selden Codex pg 07, panel 3.jpg|center|thumb|600px|The two figures on the right show the red and white "[[:Image:Tecpatl.jpg|flint knife]]" icon attached to their small speech scrolls, indicating that they are verbally attacking the travellers on the left.  From page 7 of the [[Codex Selden]].{{sfn|famsi}}]]
At times, speech scrolls are decorated with devices that describe the tone of the speech:

*In an engraving at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Chichen Itza]], a ruler's speech scroll takes the form of a serpent.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins 1992, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A Spaniard's speech scroll in a 16th-century [[Aztec codex]] is decorated with feathers to denote "soft, smooth words".&lt;ref&gt;Wishart p.300&lt;/ref&gt;
*In another 16th-century [[codex]], the [[Selden Codex]], two [[Mixtec]] rulers (photo above) are shown insulting two ambassadors through the use of "[[:Image:Tecpatl.jpg|flint knife]]" icons attached to the speech scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Boone 1994, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many native traditions, use of the speech scroll died out in the decades following the Spanish Conquest.

==European banderoles==
[[File:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|300px|A 1506 painting by [[Bernhard Strigel]] with banderole.]]
[[File:Evangeliar heinrich des loewen.jpg|thumb|300px|Scenes of the [[Resurrection]], an [[illuminated manuscript]], 1188.]]

In contrast to the abstract nature of Mesoamerican speech scrolls, Medieval European speech scrolls or '''banderoles''' appear as actual scrolls, floating in apparent three-dimensional space (or in actual space in sculpture). They first become common at the start of the [[Gothic art#Painting|Gothic period]].  Previously, as in [[Byzantine art]], spoken words, if they appeared at all, were usually painted alongside a figure; these are called [[titulus (inscription)|tituli]].  However, earlier works using banderoles are the [[Liuthar Gospels|Aachen Gospels]] of Otto III (c. 975) and the 12th-century English [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Cloisters Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kantorowicz|1997|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work demonstrates the use of banderoles as attributes for [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s, to distinguish them from the book-carrying [[Four Evangelists]] of the [[New Testament]] and other Christian saints, a convention appearing in Italy in the 13th century. It may be seen in the ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà]]'' by [[Cimabue]], ([[Uffizi]], 1280–90), [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]]'' (1308–11), and other works.  The convention had a historical appropriateness, as the Old Testament was originally written on [[scroll]]s, whereas nearly all surviving New Testament manuscripts are [[codices]] (like modern books).  They may also be used for the words of angels, especially [[Gabriel]]'s greeting to Mary in [[Annunciation]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Ladis &amp; Maginnis 1997, pp. 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 14th century, quotations in banderoles increasingly allowed artists to include more complex ideas in their works, though for the moment usually in Latin, thus greatly restricting the audience that could follow them.&lt;ref&gt;Ladis &amp; Maginnis 1997, pp. 156-161&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Mesoamerican speech scrolls, European speech scrolls usually contain the spoken words, much like a modern-day [[speech balloon]].  The majority of these are in religious works and contain Biblical quotations from the figure depicted – Old Testament prophets for example, were often shown with an appropriate quotation from their work.  Because the words are usually religious in nature, the speech scroll is often written in Latin even when appearing in [[woodcut]] illustrations for books written in the [[vernacular]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilmo 2004, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would also enable the illustration to be used in editions in other languages.

European speech scrolls may at times be seen in secular works as well and may also contain the name of a person to identify them.  On carved figures the words would usually be painted on the scroll and have since worn away.  In some Late Gothic and Renaissance works, and in architectural decoration, very elaborate empty banderoles seem to be for decorative purposes only.

The European speech scroll fell out of favor largely due to an increasing interest in [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting; the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] had a similar decline.

'''''The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood''''', a report submitted to the [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]] in [[Rome]] in 1971, by Dr [[Conrad Baars]], a Dutch-born Catholic psychiatrist from [[Minnesota]], and based on a study of 1500 priests, suggested that seminary training left priests poorly prepared for a lifetime of [[celibacy]].

==Description==
This report was published by Franciscan Herald Press in 1972 as '''''How to Treat and Prevent the Crisis in the Priesthood'''''. It was also expected to be published in 2006 by St. Paul's/Alba House as part of a book of essays on the priesthood and religious life.

#"psychosexual immaturity expressed in heterosexual or homosexual activity was encountered often. Virtually all of these priests were . . . suffering from a severe to moderate frustration neurosis”.
#Less than 15% of priests in Europe and North America were emotionally fully developed;
#Of the remaining 85%, 20–25% had "serious psychiatric difficulties" that they expressed through alcohol abuse, while 60–70% had less severe degrees of emotional immaturity.

Though the report suggested that immediate corrective action was needed, making ten recommendations, and one of those most active in the Synod was Cardinal Wojtyła, who on October 16, 1978 was elected [[Pope John Paul II]], no implementation of the report's detailed recommendations followed.

[[Implicit stereotype|Unconscious (or implicit) biases]] are learned stereotypes that are automatic, unintentional, deeply engrained, universal, and able to influence behavior.&lt;ref name="Noon"&gt;Noon, M. (2018). Pointless diversity training: Unconscious bias, new racism and agency. ''Work, Employment and Society, 32'', 198–209. {{doi|10.1177/0950017017719841}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Unconscious bias training''' programs are designed to expose people to their unconscious biases, provide tools to adjust automatic patterns of thinking, and ultimately eliminate discriminatory behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Fiarman, S. E. (2016). ''Unconscious bias: When good intentions aren't enough''. ''Educational Leadership, 74(3)'', 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
A critical component of unconscious bias training is creating awareness for implicit bias. Since 1998, the online [[Implicit-association test|Implicit-Association Test]] (IAT) has provided a platform for the general public to assess their unconscious biases. Although the IAT measure has come under scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;Banks, R. R., &amp; Ford, R. T. (2009). (How) does unconscious bias matter: Law, politics, and racial inequality. ''Emory Law Journal, 58'', 1053–1122.&lt;/ref&gt; it has sparked conversation about unconscious bias in both popular media and the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Hewer, M. (2018). [https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Observer-Feb_Interactive.pdf "How scientists are blocking bias in the world at large"]. ''APS Observer, 31(2)'', 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the public’s increased awareness of the influence of implicit biases, the reality of racial and gender inequalities in our society has led to the creation of many unconscious bias training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R. J. (2015). "Reducing racially disparate policing outcomes: Is implicit bias training the answer". ''University of Hawai'i Law Review, 37'', 295–312.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] designed a webpage to make unconscious bias training videos widely available, [[Google]] has put about 60,000 employees through a 90-minute unconscious bias training program, and the [[United States Department of Justice]] has trained 28,000 employees on techniques to combat implicit bias.&lt;ref&gt;Sleek, S. (2018). [https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Observer-Feb_Interactive.pdf "The bias beneath: Two decades of measuring implicit associations".] ''APS Observer, 31(2)'', 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training techniques ==

There are a wide variety of unconscious bias training programs, but the programs tend to follow a basic three-step method. 1. Participants take a pretest to assess baseline implicit bias levels (typically with the IAT); 2. They complete the unconscious bias training task; and 3. They take a posttest to re-evaluate  bias levels after training. Frequently follow-up tests of unconscious bias are administered days, weeks, or months after the completion of training programs to examine the long-term benefits of these programs.&lt;ref name="Devine 2012"&gt;Devine, P. G., Forscher, P. S., Austin, A. J., &amp; Cox, W. T. L. (2012). "Long-term reduction in implicit bias: A prejudice habit-breaking intervention". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 48(6), 1267-1278. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2012.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hannah"&gt;Hannah, S. D., Carpenter-Song, E. (2013). Patrolling your blind spots: Introspection and public catharsis in a medical school faculty development course to reduce unconscious bias in medicine. ''Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry, 37,'' 314–339. {{doi|10.1007/s11013-013-9320-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Van Ryan"&gt;van Ryn, M., Hardeman, R., Phelan, S. M., Burgess, D. J., Dovidio, J.

''Journal of General Internal Medicine'', 30(12), 1748–1756. {{doi|10.1007/s11606-015-3447-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, S. C., Prasad, S., &amp; Hackman, H. W. (2015). "Training providers on issues of race and racism improve health care equity". ''Race, Racism, and Medicine'', 62, 915–917. {{doi|10.1002/pbc.25448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficacy of these programs is still not clear-cut as researchers continue to test them.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;Burns, M. D., Monteith, M. J., &amp; Parker, L. R. (2017). "Training away bias: The differential effects of counterstereotype training and self-regulation on stereotype activation and application". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 73, 97–110. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2017.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counterstereotype ===
According to a metanalysis of 17 unconscious bias interventions, counterstereotype training is the most effective way to reduce unconscious bias.&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;Lai, C. (2014). "Reducing implicit racial references: I. A comparative investigation of 17 interventions". ''Journal of experimental psychology'', 143(4), 1765–1785. {{doi|10.1037/a0036260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of gender bias, techniques such as imagining powerful women, hearing their stories, and writing essays about them has been shown to reduce levels of unconscious gender bias on the IAT.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;Blair, I. V., Ma, J. E., &amp; Lenton, A. P. (2001). "Imagining stereotypes away: The moderation of implicit stereotypes through mental imagery". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 81(5), 828–841. {{doi|10.1037//0022-3514.81.5.828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dasgupta and Asagari (2004) found that real life counterstereotypes, such as going to a women’s college or having female professors, have the ability to decrease bias because the idea that women are intelligent and hard-working is repeatedly reinforced.&lt;ref name= "Dasgupta"&gt;Dasgupta, N., &amp; Asgari, S. (2004). "Seeing is believing: Exposure to counterstereotypic women leaders and its effect on the malleability of automatic gender stereotyping." ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 40, 642–658. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2004.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of racial bias, several studies have replicated the finding that training participants to pair counterstereotypical traits such as “successful” with images of black individuals is an effective tool for reducing implicit racial bias.&lt;ref name= "Woodcock"&gt;Woodcock, A., &amp; Monteith, M. J. (2013). "Forging links with the self to combat implicit bias". ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 16(4), 445–461. {{doi|10.1177/1368430212459776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;Hu, X., Antony, J. W., Creery, J. D., Varags, I. M., Bodenhausen, G. V., &amp; Paller, K. A. (2015). Unlearning implicit social biases during sleep. ''Science, 348'', 1013–1015. {{doi|10.1126/science.aaa3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, I. R., Kopp, B. M., Petty, R. E. (2018). "Just say no! (and mean it): Meaningful negation as a tool to modify automatic racial attitudes". ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 21(1), 88–110.{{doi|10.17117/1368430216647189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawakami, Dovido, and van Kamp (2005) challenged the effectiveness of counterstereotype training when they found that participants actually showed an increase in gender bias after training. Rather than using the IAT to assess levels of unconscious bias, the researchers asked participants to read a resume and decide if the applicant was qualified for a leadership job because, "when ambiguity exists in an individual's qualifications or competence, evaluators will fill the void with assumptions drawn from gender stereotypes".&lt;ref name= "Isaac"&gt;Isaac, C., Lee, B., &amp; Carnes, M. (2009). "Interventions that affect gender bias in hiring: A systematic review". ''Aca Med'', 84(10), 1440-1446. {{doi|10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b6ba00}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants received one of four resumes describing equally qualified candidates. The only difference between the four resumes was the name of the applicant—two had female names and two had male names. When participants were administered the job application task immediately following counterstereotype training, they were more likely to pick the male candidates over the female candidates, which made it appear as though the counterstereotype training was ineffective. However, when the researchers added a distractor task between the counterstereotype training and the job application task, participants selected male and female candidates at an equal rate. When participants had to engage in a cognitive task while simultaneously selecting a candidate, they were more likely to select the female applicants.&lt;ref name= "Kawakami 2005"&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovido, J. F., &amp; van Kamp, S. (2005). "Kicking the habit: Effects of nonstereotypic association training and correction processes on hiring decisions". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 41, 68–75. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2004.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers did a follow up study with a slightly different procedure to determine why bias was increased in some conditions and decreased in others. They followed the same counterstereotype training procedure, but divided the job application task into two distinct parts. Participants were either asked to first pick the best candidate for the job and then rank each candidate on sixteen traits (half were female stereotypes and the other half were male stereotypes) or they were asked to complete the tasks in the opposite order. Regardless of the order, participants consistently were biased against women in the first task, but not in the second task. The researchers hypothesized that the participants were able to discern that the purpose of the study was to reduce gender bias, so they showed an increase bias in the first task to compensate for the researcher’s attempt to influence their behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Kawakami 2007"&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovido, J. F., &amp; van Kamp, S. (2007). "The impact of counterstereotypic training and related correction processes on the application of stereotypes". ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 10(2), 139–156. {{doi|10.1177/1368430207074725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is necessary to determine why participants showed decreased bias on the second task and if the decreased has an enduring effect.

Hu and colleagues (2015) created a form of counterstereotype training to unlearn implicit bias while sleeping.&lt;ref name="Hu" /&gt; Participants completed the typical counterstereotype training task of pairing images of people with different genders and races with counterstereotypical traits. However, their study differed from previous research because two unique sounds played after each successful pairing of either a gender or race counterstereotype. After the training task, participants were asked to take a 90-minute nap, and their sleep patterns were monitored with [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]. Once participants entered into [[slow-wave sleep]], the researchers played either the sound that followed correct gender counterstereotypes or racial counterstereotypes in the training task. After follow up assessments, the results showed that bias was successfully reduced depending on the sound played during sleep, meaning the people that listened to the sound associated with gender counterstereotypes showed reduced gender bias, but not racial bias, and vice versa. The specific reduced bias remained when the participants returned to the lab a week after initial training and testing.&lt;ref name="Hu" /&gt;

=== Negation ===
Negation training decreases implicit bias through actively rejecting information that reinforces stereotypes, therefore breaking the habit of stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Kawakami, Dovido, Moll, Hermsen, and Russin (2000) conducted one of the first studies to test the effects of negation training on reducing unconscious bias. In their study, participants were presented with pictures of black and white individuals along with a word that represented a stereotype. The participants were instructed to press "NO" during stereotype-consistent trials (for example, a black person and the word "lazy"), and "YES" during stereotype-inconsistent trials (a black person paired with "successful"). Participants showed significant decreases in automatic bias from the pretest to posttest.&lt;ref name= "Kawakami 2000"&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovido, J. F., Moll, J., Hermsen, S., &amp; Russin, A. (2000). "Just say no (to stereotyping): Effects of training in the negation of stereotypic associations on stereotype activation". ''Journal of Personality and Psychology'', 78(5), 871–888. {{doi|10.1037//O022-3514.78.5.871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gawronski, Deutsch, Mbirkou, Seibt, and Strack(2006) hypothesized that negation training was not only ineffective, but could actually strengthen unconscious biases. They stated that Kawakami and colleagues only produced positive results because when the participants responded, "YES" to stereotype-inconsistent word-picture pairings, they were using counterstereotyping rather than negation. To test these claims, the researchers created separate counterstereotype and negation conditions. The counterstereotype condition was instructed to press "YES" for stereotype-inconsistent information, while the negation condition was told to press "NO" for stereotype-consistent information. The results showed that the counterstereotype condition decreased implicit bias, but the negation condition increased bias. A possible explanation for the increase in bias with negation training is the level of control required during memory retrieval. During negation training, the memory of a previously held stereotype is activated and then you have to purposefully reject the meaning of the memory. The participants were repeatedly activating the memory of the stereotype, which made it stronger, and they were not able to replace the stereotype with a positive counterstereotype. Alternatively, in counterstereotyping, you do not have to exhibit control to reject a memory because a new and separate memory for stereotype-inconsistent information is formed.&lt;ref name= "Gawronski"&gt;Gawronski, B., Deutsch, R., Mbirkou, S., Seibt, B., Strack, F. (2008). "When 'Just Say No' is not enough: Affirmation versus negation training and the reduction of automatic stereotype activation". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44'', 270–377. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2006.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Recently, Johnson, Kopp, and Petty (2018) attempted to reconcile the discrepant results of the previous research. They argued the negation was not meaningful and participants were not adequately motivated to get rid of their unconscious biases. The researchers introduced a condition in which participants were told to think, "That's wrong!" in response to stereotype-consistent information. Other participants were told, instead, to continue to use the typical form of negation and simply responded "No" to stereotype-consistent information. The researchers hypothesized that "No" is an ambiguous and weak response to stereotypes, but "That's wrong!" is a specific and morally tied response that is hard to ignore. When participants were told to think, "that's wrong!" in response stereotype-consistent information, there was a decrease in unconscious bias that was not observed in the condition that simply thought "no". Additionally, the researchers discovered that motivation plays a role in the effectiveness of unconscious bias training programs. After the negation training tasks, participants took the Motivation to Control for Prejudiced Reactions Scale (MCPR) to measure the participants' drive to change their unconscious biases. People who scored particularly high on the MCPR showed a reduction in bias regardless of the condition. Therefore, if people feel determined to reduce their unconscious biases and think "that's wrong" rather than "no", negation training shows promising results for decreasing implicit racial bias.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Perspective-taking ===
Perspective-taking creates a sense of empathy for a stereotyped group, which has been shown to improve attitudes towards individuals as well as their group as a whole.&lt;ref name="Shih"&gt;Shih, M. J., Wang, E., Bucher, A. T., &amp; Stotzer, R. (2009). "Perspective taking: Reducing prejudice towards general outgroups and specific individuals". ''Group Processing &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 12(5), 565–577. {{doi|10.1177/1368430209337463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, perspective-taking studies follow a three-step procedure. First, participants are exposed to the target minority group through watching a video that displays examples of racial discrimination or through viewing a photograph of an individual from the target minority group. Then participants are told to reflect on that person’s life and their emotions or imagine themselves as the main character. A separate control group watches the same movie or views the same photograph, but they are not given any additional instructions involving perspective-taking. Lastly, participants’ biases are reassessed through answering questionnaires, retaking IAT, or engaging in specific tasks. This prototypical form of perspective-taking has been shown to effectively reduce racial bias.&lt;ref name="Dovido"&gt;Dovido, J. F., ten Vergert, M., Steward, T. L., Gaertner, S. L., Johnson, J. D., Esses, V. M., Riek, B. M., Pearson, A. R. (2004). Perspective and prejudice: Antecedents and mediating mechanisms. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 30(12), 1537–1549. {{doi|10.1177/0146167204271177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;Todd, A. R., Bodenhausen, G. V., Richeson, J. A., &amp; Galinksy, A. D. (2011). "Perspective taking combats automatic expressions of racial bias". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 100(6), 1027–1042.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dovidio and colleagues (2004) found that a diverse group of strangers can come together as a unified group if they believe they share a common threat. Stimulating a perceived common threat can reduce bias, because people are less likely to be biased against members of their own group.&lt;ref name="Dovido" /&gt; Todd, Bodenhausen, Richenson, and Galinksy (2011) showed participants an image of a black man, had them write an essay about a day in his life, and then watched the participants interact with a black researcher. The face-to-face interactions were more successful and natural with the participants in the perspective-taking condition compared to the control group.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

Another example of perspective-taking was tested by Shih, Stotzer, and Guitérrez (2009). They had participants watch a clip of a movie that showed an Asian American being discriminated against and were told to read a college admissions folder and decide if the student should be admitted. The admission profiles were exactly the same, except one version checked White for ethnicity while the other checked Asian American. The participants in the perspective-taking condition demonstrated greater empathy towards the Asian profile and were more likely to accept him than the control condition.&lt;ref name="Shih" /&gt; In 2013, they conducted an additional study in which they added a task where they flashed the pronouns "us" or "them" before showing an adjective with a good or bad connotation. They found that participants that were in the control group quickly associated good adjectives with "us" and bad adjective with "them", while the perspective-taking group did not show a significant time difference between the two categories. The researchers concluded that empathy and perspective taking could reduce prejudice towards discriminated groups.&lt;ref name= "Shih 2013"&gt;Shih, M. J., Stotzer, R., &amp; Guitérrez, A. S. (2013). "Perspective-taking and empathy: Generalizing the reduction of group bias towards Asian Americans to general outgroups". ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 4(2), 79–83. {{doi|10.1037/a0029790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Kaatz and colleagues (2017) had participants play a video game where they are the character Jamal, a black graduate student working towards a degree in science. Throughout the game, players had to complete tasks such as selecting an advisor, attending conferences, and publishing papers. During each task, the players experienced hardships due to racial discrimination and learn about implicit bias. In order to successfully complete the game, players had to be able to learn how to recognize, label, and talk about bias. After completing the game, participants filled out surveys about their experiences. Most participants agreed that it was an effective strategy for reducing unconscious bias.&lt;ref name= "Kaatz"&gt;Kaatz, A., Carner, M., Gutierrez, B., Savoy, J., Samuel, C., Filut, A., &amp; Pribbenow, C. M. (2017). "Fair play: A study of scientific workforce trainers' experience playing an educational video game about racial bias". ''CBE- Life Sciences Education'', 16(7), 1–18. {{doi|10.1187/cbe.15-06-0140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is necessary to objectively measure the effectiveness of the game.

=== Meditation ===
Meditation has become integrated into a variety of Western therapeutic practices due to its benefits of enhanced well-being, reduced depression and anxiety, and overall mood improvement.&lt;ref name="Stell"&gt;Stell, A. J., &amp; Farsides, T. (2016). "Brief loving-kindness meditation reduces racial bias, mediated by positive other-regarding emotions". ''Motivation and Emotion'', 40(1), 140–147. {{doi|10.1007/s11031-015-9514-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, meditation was incorporated into unconscious bias training using [[Mettā|Lovingkindness meditation]] (LKM), which "aims to self-regulate an affective state of unconditional kindness towards the self and others".&lt;ref name="Stell" /&gt; Meditation studies follow the format of a pretest IAT, participation in a LKM program, and a posttest IAT. Hutcherson, Seppala, and Gross (2008) showed that a few minutes of LMK could create a sense of empathy and compassion for a neutral target, which inspired the idea to use meditation as an unconscious bias training technique.&lt;ref name= "Hutcherson"&gt;Hutcherson, C. A., Seppala, E. M., &amp; Gross, J. J. (2008). "Loving-kindness meditation increases social connectedness". ''Emotion'', 8(5), 720–724. {{doi|10.1037/a0013237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stell and Farsides (2016) found that after only seven minutes of LMK, unconscious racial bias for a targeted group was reduced.&lt;ref name="Stell" /&gt; Kang, Gray, and Dovido (2014) found that participants who attend a seven-week meditation course showed a significant decrease unconscious bias towards African Americans and homeless people. Notably, participants who participated in a discussion based on the Lovingkindness philosophy for seven weeks but did not practice meditation did not show a reduction in bias after the seven weeks.&lt;ref name= "Kang"&gt;Kang, Y., Gray, J. R., Dovido, J. F. (2014). "The nondiscriminating heart: Lovingkindness meditation training decreases implicit intergroup bias". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 143(3)'', 1306–1313. {{doi|10.1037/a0034150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implicit bias workshops ===
{{essay-like|section|date=September 2018}}
{{citation-style|section|date=September 2018}}
Implicit bias workshops typically use a combination of strategies to reduce unconscious bias. Devine, Forscher, Austin, and Cox (2012) created a workshop that uses five different techniques to combat bias; stereotype replacement, counterstereotype training, individualism, perspective taking, and increased opportunities for contact with minority races. In stereotype replacement, participants try to recognize their stereotypes, reflect on why they have those stereotypes, consider how they could avoid those stereotypes in the future, and come up with an unbiased response to replace their stereotypes. The counterstereotype training involves picturing examples of counterstereotypes. For example, if the counterstereotype is intelligence, participants are asked to picture an intelligent black individual such as President Obama or a family friend. During the individualism portion of the workshop, participants receive specific information about members of a stereotyped group so they can remember each person as an individual rather than seeing the group as a singular unit. Perspective-taking involves imagining yourself as a member of a stereotyped group. Lastly, participants are provided with opportunities to have positive interactions with members of minority groups. Studies show that four and eight weeks after completing the workshop, and unconscious bias (as measured by the IAT) was reduced.&lt;ref name="Devine 2012" /&gt; Moss-Racusin and colleagues (2016) created a 120-minute workshop called "Scientific Diversity" that was aimed at reducing gender bias. During the workshop, instructors present empirical evidence on implicit bias, encourage active group discussion, and help participants practice techniques for creating an accepting environment. To assess bias, participants took pretest and posttest questionnaires. The posttest questionnaires revealed that participants experienced increased diversity awareness and decreased subtle gender bias.&lt;ref name= "Moss"&gt;Moss-Racusin, C. A., van der Toorn, J., Dovidio, J. F., Brescoll, V. L., Graham, M. J., &amp; Handelsman, J. (2016). "A 'scientific diversity' intervention to reduce gender bias in a sample of life scientists". ''CBE-Life Sciences Education'', 15, 1–11. {{doi|10.1187/cbe.15-09-0187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gonzales, Kim, and Marantz (2014), the recognition of bias cannot be taught in a single session, so researchers have created workshops or class curriculums that span days, semesters, or even years.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, C. M., Kim, M. Y., &amp; Marantz, P. R. (2014). "Implicit bias and its relation to health disparities: A teaching program and survey of medical students". ''Teaching and learning in medicine'', 26(1), 64–71. {{doi|10.1080/10401334.2013.857341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah and Carpenter-Song (2013) created a semester-long course that focuses on [[introspection]]. Students are encouraged to look within themselves to examine their own bias, values, and most importantly, blind spots. During each class, students discuss articles about various forms of bias and participate in interactive exercises that are designed to promote perspective-taking and empathy. Tests of the course showed that students who have an active interest in learning about issues of implicit bias were able to successfully reduce their levels of bias. However, a subset of the students did not reduce bias or even showed an increased bias after the course because the program was mandatory and they were not incentivized to change their thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Hannah" /&gt;

Van Ryn and colleagues (2015) started a course for medical school students that studies disparities in minority health care. The researchers were able to implement various forms of the class in forty-nine medical schools and collected data from 3,547 students. During class, students read articles about unconscious bias, hold group discussions, and gain experience with interacting with racial minorities. Participants took the IAT during their first and last semesters of medical school to assess the effectiveness of the program. Though most reductions in implicit bias were small, the reductions were significant and affected behaviors. Students reported feeling more comfortable when working with minorities and kept in mind implicit biases when treating minorities.&lt;ref name="Van Ryan" /&gt;

Stone, Moskowitz, and Zestcott (2015) conducted a workshop for medical students that used self-reflection techniques to motivate health care providers to address their implicit biases. First, participants took an IAT (but did not receive feedback) and read an article about implicit bias in medicine. A week later, the participants attended a lecture about implicit bias and had a classroom demonstration of an IAT. Two days later, participants discussed strategies for reducing bias, seeking common-identities, and taking the perspective of patients in small groups. When participants retook the IAT three to seven days after the workshop, there was a significant decrease in implicit bias.&lt;ref name= "Zestcott"&gt;Zestcott, C. A., Blair, I. V., Stone, J. (2016). "Examining the presence, consequences, and reduction of implicit bias in health care: A narrative review".

[[File:Vesica_piscis_circles.svg|thumb|The vesica piscis is the intersection of two congruent disks, each centered on the perimeter of the other.]]
The '''vesica piscis''' is a type of [[Lens (geometry)|lens]], a mathematical [[shape]] formed by the [[Intersection (Euclidean geometry)|intersection]] of two [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] with the same radius, intersecting in such a way that the center of each disk lies on the perimeter of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[File:Euclid-proof.jpg|thumb|The vesica piscis in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']]]]
This figure appears in the first proposition of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], where it forms the first step in constructing an [[equilateral triangle]] using a [[compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]]. The triangle has as its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] the two disk centers and one of the two sharp corners of the vesica piscis.&lt;ref name="The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heath|first1=Sir Thomas L.|title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements|date=1956|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0486600904|pages=241|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical description ==
Mathematically, the vesica piscis is a special case of a [[lens (geometry)|lens]], the shape formed by the intersection of two disks.

The mathematical ratio of the height of the vesica piscis to the width across its center is the [[square root of 3]], or 1.7320508... (since if straight lines are drawn connecting the centers of the two circles with each other and with the two points where the circles intersect, two equilateral triangles join along an edge). The ratios 265:153 = 1.7320261... and 1351:780 = 1.7320513... are two of a series of [[Best rational approximation|approximations]] to this value, each with the property that no better approximation can be obtained with smaller whole numbers.  [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]], in his ''[[On the Measurement of the Circle]]'', uses these ratios as upper and lower bounds:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Heath| first = Thomas Little| year = 1897| title = The Works of Archimedes| publication-place = Cambridge University| pages = ''lxxvii ''; 50| url = https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp | accessdate = 2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1351}{780} &gt; \sqrt{3} &gt; \tfrac{265}{153}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Area===
[[Image:Vesica Piscis.jpg|thumb|The areas in blue – an equilateral triangle and a segment form together a sector of one sixth of the circle (60°)]]

The area of the vesica piscis is formed by two [[equilateral triangle]]s and four equal [[circular segment]]s. In the drawing one triangle and one segment appear in blue.

One triangle and one segment form a sector of one sixth of the circle (60°).
The area of the sector is then: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the side of the equilateral triangle has length {{mvar|r}}, its area is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The area of the segment is the difference between those two areas:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

By summing the areas of two triangles and four segments, we obtain the area of the vesica piscis:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} (4\pi - 3\sqrt{3})r^2 \approx 1.2284r^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Chalice Well Cover.jpg|thumb|The modern cover of the [[Chalice Well]] with an artistic rendering of the vesica piscis]]
The two circles of the vesica piscis, or three circles forming in pairs three vesicae, are commonly used in [[Venn diagram]]s. Arcs of the same three circles can also be used to form the [[triquetra]] symbol, and the [[Reuleaux triangle]].

In [[Christian art]], some [[aureola]]s are in the shape of a vertically oriented vesica piscis, and the [[Seal (device)#Ecclesiastical seals|seals of ecclesiastical organizations]] can be enclosed within a vertically oriented vesica piscis (instead of the more usual circular enclosure). Also, the [[icthys]] symbol incorporates the vesica piscis shape.

[[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] of the [[Catholic Church]] appeared first in [[Seal (device)#Ecclesiastical seals|seals]], nearly all vesica-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;
Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in  ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1910) {{CathEncy | wstitle=Ecclesiastical Heraldry | short=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/oce/browse-page-scans.php?id=dc013cb5997fb53cc04095551d3b9e33 Scanned reproduction of the article, with illustrations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224021607/http://oce.catholic.com/oce/browse-page-scans.php?id=dc013cb5997fb53cc04095551d3b9e33 |date=2014-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the [[Chalice Well]] in [[Glastonbury]] ([[Somerset]], [[United Kingdom]]) depicts a stylized version of the vesica piscis design (see picture).

The vesica piscis has been used as a symbol within [[Freemasonry]], most notably in the shapes of the collars worn by officiants of the Masonic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. M. Ward, An Interpretation of Our Masonic Symbols, 1924, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also considered the proper shape for the enclosure of the seals of Masonic lodges.&lt;ref&gt;Albert G. Mackey, Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry, 1921 ed., vol. 2, p. 827.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Eyer, [http://academialodge.org/article_vesica_piscis.php The Vesica Piscis and Freemasonry]. Retrieved on 2009-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vesica piscis is also used as proportioning system in architecture, in particular [[Gothic architecture]]. The system was illustrated in [[Cesare Cesariano]]'s Vitruvius (1521), which he called "the rule of the German architects".

The vesica piscis is a leitmotif of architect [[Carlo Scarpa]] and is used as a “viewing device” in Tomba Brion ([[Brion Cemetery]]) in [[San Vito d'Altivole]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/conferences/human/papers/Cannata.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401065416/http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/conferences/human/papers/Cannata.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63969">'''Vocal learning''' is the ability to modify acoustic and syntactic sounds, acquire new sounds via imitation, and produce vocalizations. "Vocalizations" in this case refers only to sounds generated by the vocal organ (mammalian [[larynx]] or avian [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]]) as opposed to by the lips, teeth, and tongue, which require substantially less motor control.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petkov | first1 = CI. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = ED. | title = Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates. | journal = Front Evol Neurosci | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 12 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3389/fnevo.2012.00012 | pmid = 22912615 | pmc = 3419981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rare trait, vocal learning is a critical substrate for spoken language and has only been detected in eight animal groups despite the wide array of vocalizing species; these include [[humans]], [[bats]], [[cetaceans]], [[pinnipeds]] ([[Pinniped|seals]] and [[sea lions]]), [[elephants]], and three distantly related bird groups including [[songbirds]], [[parrots]], and [[hummingbirds]]. Vocal learning is distinct from [[auditory learning]], or the ability to form memories of sounds heard, a relatively common trait which is present in all vertebrates tested. For example, dogs can be trained to understand the word "sit" even though the human word is not in its innate auditory repertoire (auditory learning). However, the dog cannot imitate and produce the word "sit" itself as vocal learners can.

==Classification==
[[File:Continuum Hypothesis.tiff|thumb|400px|Hypothetical distributions of two behavioral phenotypes: vocal learning and sensory (auditory) sequence learning. We hypothesize that the behavioral phenotypes of vocal learning and auditory learning are distributed along several categories.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}} (A) Vocal learning complexity phenotype and (B) auditory sequence learning phenotype. The left axis (blue) illustrates the hypothetical distribution of species along the behavioral phenotype dimensions. The right axis (black step functions) illustrates different types of transitions along the hypothesized vocal-learning (A) or auditory-learning (B) complexity dimensions. Whether the actual distributions are continuous functions (blue curves), will need to be tested, in relation to the alternatives that there are several categories with gradual transitions or step functions (black curves). Although auditory learning is a prerequisite for vocal learning and there can be a correlation between the two phenotypes (A–B), the two need not be interdependent. A theoretical Turing machine (Turing, 1968) is illustrated [G∗], which can outperform humans on memory for digitized auditory input but is not a vocal learner. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
Historically, species have been classified into the binary categories of vocal learner or vocal non-learner based on their ability to produce novel vocalizations or imitate other species, with evidence from [[social isolation]], deafening studies, and [[cross-fostering]] experiments.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt; However, vocal learners exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation between species, resulting in a spectrum of ability. The vocalizations of [[songbirds]] and [[whales]] have a syntactic-like organization similar to that of humans but are limited to Finite-State Grammars (FSGs), where they can generate strings of sequences with limited structural complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okanoya|first=K|title=The Bengalese finch: a window on the behavioral neurobiology of birdsong syntax|journal=Ann.

Within avian vocal learners, for example, [[zebra finch]] songs only contain strictly linear transitions that go through different syllables in a motif from beginning to end, yet [[mockingbird]] and [[nightingale]] songs show element repetition within a range of legal repetitions, non-adjacent relationships between distant song elements, and forward and backward branching in song element transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Honda|first=E|author2=Okanoya K |title=Acoustical and syntactical com- parisons between songs of the white-backed Munia (Lonchura striata) and its domesticated strain, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica)|journal=Zool.

===Continuum hypothesis===
Even further complicating the original binary classification is evidence from recent studies that suggests that there is greater variability in a non-learner's ability to modify vocalizations based on experience than previously thought. Findings in suboscine [[passerine birds]], [[non-human primates]], [[mice]], and [[goats]], has led to the proposal of the vocal learning continuum hypothesis by [[Erich Jarvis]] and Gustavo Arriaga. Based on the apparent variations seen in various studies, the continuum hypothesis reclassifies species into non-learner, limited vocal learner, moderate vocal learning, complex vocal learner and high vocal learner categories where higher tiers have fewer species. Under this system, previously identified non-human vocal learners like [[songbirds]] are considered complex learners while humans fall under the “high” category; non-human [[primates]], [[mice]], and [[goats]], which are traditionally classified as non-learners, are considered limited vocal learners under this system.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

==Evidence of vocal learning in various species==

===Known vocal learners===

====Birds====
The most extensively studied [[model organism]]s of vocal learning are found in birds, namely songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds.  The degree of vocal learning in each specific species varies. While many parrots and certain songbirds like canaries can imitate and spontaneously combine learned sounds during all periods of their life, other songbirds and hummingbirds are limited to a certain songs learned during their [[critical period]].

====Bats====
The first evidence for audio-vocal learning in a non-human mammal was produced by Karl-Heinz Esser in 1994. Hand-reared infant [[lesser spear-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomos discolor'') were able to adapt their isolation calls to an external reference signal. Isolation calls in a control group that had no reference signal did not show the same adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esser | first1 = KH | year = 1994 | title = Audio-vocal learning in a non-human mammal: the lesser spear-nosed bat ''Phyllostomus discolor'' | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 5 | issue = 14| pages = 1718–1720 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199409080-00007 | pmid=7827315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for vocal learning in bats appeared in 1998 when Janette Wenrick Boughman studied female [[greater spear-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomus hastatus''). These bats live in unrelated groups and use group contact calls that differ among [[social groups]]. Each social group has a single call, which differs in frequency and temporal characteristics. When individual bats were introduced to a new social group, the group call began to morph, taking on new frequency and temporal characteristics, and over time, calls of transfer and resident bats in the same group more closely resembled their new modified call than their old calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boughman | first1 = JW | year = 1998 | title = Vocal learning by greater spear-nosed bats | url = | journal = Proc. Biol. Sci. | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 227–233 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cetaceans====

=====Whales=====
Male [[humpback whales]] (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') sing as a form of [[sexual display]] while [[Animal migration|migrating]] to and from their breeding grounds. All males in a population produce the same song which can change over time, indicating vocal learning and [[cultural transmission]], a characteristic shared by some bird populations. Songs become increasingly dissimilar over distance and populations in different oceans have dissimilar songs.

Whale songs recorded along the east coast of Australia in 1996 showed introduction of a novel song by two foreign whales who had migrated from the west Australian coast to the east Australian coast. In just two years, all members of the population had switched songs. This new song was nearly identical to ones sung by migrating humpback whales on the west Australian Coast, and the two new singers who introduced the song are hypothesized to have introduced the new "foreign" song to the population on the east Australian coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noad | first1 = MJ | last2 = Cato | first2 = DH | last3 = Bryden | first3 = MM | last4 = Jenner | first4 = MN | last5 = Jenner | first5 = KC. | year = 2000 | title = Cultural revolution in whale songs | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | page = 537 |pmid=11117730|doi=10.1038/35046199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocal learning has also been seen in [[killer whale]]s (''Orcinus orca''). Two juvenile killer whales, separated from their natal pods, were seen mimicking cries of [[California sea lion]]s (''Zalophus californianus'') that were near the region they lived in. The composition of the calls of these two juveniles were also different from their natal groups, reflecting more of the sea lion calls than that of the whales.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, AD; Griffin, RM; Howitt, D; Larsson, L, Miller, PJO; and Hoelzel, AR. (2006). Killer whales are capable of vocal learning. ''Biol. Lett.'', 2, pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dolphins=====
Captive [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops truncatus'') can be trained to emit sounds through their blowhole in open air. Through training, these vocal emissions can be altered from natural patterns to resemble sounds like the human voice, measurable through the number of bursts of sound emitted by the dolphin. In 92% of exchanges between humans and dolphins, the number of bursts equaled ±1 of the number of syllables spoken by a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lilly | first1 = JC. | year = 1965 | title = Vocal mimicry in tursiops: ability to match numbers and durations of human vocal bursts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 147 | issue = 3655| pages = 300–301 | doi=10.1126/science.147.3655.300 | pmid=17788214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study used an underwater keyboard to demonstrate that dolphins are able to learn various whistles in order to do an activity or obtain an object. Complete mimicry occurred within ten attempts for these trained dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reiss | first1 = D | last2 = McCowan | first2 = B | year = 1993 | title = Spontaneous vocal mimicry and production by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus): Evidence for vocal learning | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 107 | issue = 3| pages = 301–312 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.107.3.301 | pmid=8375147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of dolphins have given even more evidence of spontaneous [[mimicry]] of species-specific whistles and other biological and computer-generated signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herman | first1 = LM | last2 = Richards | first2 = DG | last3 = Wolz | first3 = JP. | year = 1984 | title = Comprehension of sentences by bottlenosed dolphins | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 129–219 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(84)90003-9 | pmid=6540652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such vocal learning has also been identified in wild bottlenose dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins develop a distinct signature whistle in the first few months of life, which is used to identify and distinguish itself from other individuals. This individual distinctiveness could have been a driving force for evolution by providing higher species fitness since complex communication is largely correlated with increased intelligence.  However, vocal identification is present in vocal non-learners as well. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual identification was a primary driving force for the evolution of vocal learning. Each signature whistle can be learned by other individuals for identification purposes and are used primarily when the dolphin in question is out of sight. Bottlenose dolphins use their learned whistles in matching interactions, which are likely to be used while addressing each other, signalling alliance membership to a third party, or preventing deception by an imitating dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janik | first1 = VM.| year = 2000 | title =  Whistle matching in wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5483| pages = 1355–1357  | quote = Comparative studies indicate that whistles vary in structure across populations and species (Steiner 1981; Ding et al. 1995; Rendell et al. 1999), with whistle divergence perhaps facilitating species recognition and speciation (Podos et al. 2002).| doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1355 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mate attraction and territory defense have also been seen as possible contributors to vocal learning evolution. Studies on this topic point out that while both vocal learners and non-learners use vocalizations to attract mates or defend territories, there is one key difference: variability. Vocal learners can produce a more varied arrangement of vocalizations and frequencies, which studies show may be more preferred by females. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldwell|first1=D.K.|title=How animals communicate|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed that male Atlantic bottlenose dolphins may initiate a challenge by facing another dolphin, opening its mouth, thereby exposing its teeth, or arching its back slightly and holding its head downward. This behavior is more along the lines of visual communication but still may or may not be accompanied by vocalizations such as burst-pulsed sounds. The burst-pulsed sounds, which are more complex and varied than the whistles, are often utilized to convey excitement, dominance or aggression such as when they are competing for the same piece of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janik|first1=Vincent|title=Communication in bottlenose dolphins: 50 years of signature whistle research|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|volume=199|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1007/s00359-013-0817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dolphins also produce these forceful sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. On the sexual side &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldwell|first1=D.K.|title=How Animals Communicate|pages=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw that dolphins may solicit a sexual response from another by swimming in front of it, looking back, and rolling on its side to display the genital region. These observations provide yet another example of visual communication where dolphins exhibit different postures and non-vocal behaviors to communicate with others that also may or may not be accompanied by vocalizations. Sexual selection for greater variability, and thus in turn vocal learning, may then be a major driving force for the evolution of vocal learning.

====Seals====
Captive [[harbor seal]]s (''Phoca vitulina'') were recorded mimicking human words such as "hello", "Hoover" (the seal's own name) and producing other speech-like sounds. Most of the vocalizations occurred during the reproductive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ralls | first1 = K | last2 = Fiorelli | first2 = P | last3 = Gish | first3 = S. | year = 1985 | title = Vocalizations and vocal mimicry in captive harbour seals, Phoca vitulina | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1050–1056 | doi=10.1139/z85-157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More evidence of vocal learning in seals occurs in [[southern elephant seal]]s (''Mirounga leonine''). Young males imitate the vocal cries of successful older males during their [[breeding season]]. [[northern elephant seal|northern]] and southern elephant seals have a highly [[polygynous]] mating system with a vast disparity in mating success. In other words, few males guard huge [[harem (zoology)|harems]] of females, eliciting intense [[Sexual selection in mammals#Male-male competition|male-male competition]]. Antagonistic vocal cries play an important role in inter-male competitions and are hypothesized to demonstrate the resource-holding potential of the emitter. In both species, antagonistic vocal cries vary geographically and are structurally complex and individually distinct. Males displays unique calls, which can be identified by the specific arrangement of syllable and syllable parts.

Harem holders frequently vocalize to keep peripheral males away from females, and these vocalizations are the dominant component in a young juvenile's acoustic habitat. Successful vocalizations are heard by juveniles, who then imitate these calls as they get older in an attempt to obtain a harem for themselves. Novel vocal types expressed by dominant males spread quickly through populations of breeding elephant seals and are even imitated by juveniles in the same season.

Genetic analysis indicated that successful vocal patterns were not passed down hereditarily, indicating that this behavior is learned. Progeny of successful harem holders do not display their father's vocal calls and the call that makes one male successful often disappears entirely from the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanvito | first1 = S | last2 = Galimberti | first2 = F | last3 = Miller | first3 = EH. | year = 2007 | title = Observational evidences of vocal learning in southern elephant seals: a longitudinal study | url = | journal = Ethology | volume = 113 | issue = 2| pages = 137–146 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elephants====
Mlaika, a ten-year-old adolescent female [[African elephant]], has been recorded imitating truck sounds coming from the Nairobi-Mombasa highway three miles away. Analysis of Mlaika's truck-like calls show that they are different from the normal calls of African elephants, and that her calls are a general model of truck sounds, not copies of the sounds of trucks recorded at the same time of the calls. In other words, Mlaika's truck calls are not imitations of the trucks that she hears, but rather, a generalized model she developed over time.

Other evidence of vocal learning in elephants occurred in a cross-fostering situation with a captive African elephant. At the [[Basel Zoo]] in [[Switzerland]], Calimero, a male [[African elephant]], was kept with two female [[Asian elephants]]. Recordings of his cries shows evidence of chirping noises, typically only produced by [[Asian elephants]]. The duration and frequency of these calls differs from recorded instances of chirping calls from other African elephants and more closely resembles the chirping calls of [[Asian elephants]].&lt;ref&gt;Poole, JH et al. (2005). "Animal behaviour: elephants are capable of vocal learning." ''Nature'' 434.7032 : 455-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversial or limited vocal learners===
The following species are not formally considered vocal learners, but some evidence has suggested they may have limited abilities to modify their vocalizations. Further research is needed in these species to fully understand their learning abilities.

====Non-human primates====
Early research asserted that primate calls are fully formed at an early age in development, yet recently some studies have suggested these calls are modified later in life.&lt;ref name=owren&gt;Owren, MJ, et al. (1992). "'Food' Calls Produced by Adult Female Rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese (M. fuscata) Macaques, Their Normally-Raised Offspring, and Offspring Cross-Fostered between Species." ''Behaviour'': 218-231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Masataka and Fujita cross-fostered [[Japanese macaque|Japanese]] and [[rhesus monkeys]] in the same room and demonstrated that foraging calls were learned directly from their foster mothers, providing evidence of vocal learning.&lt;ref&gt;Masataka, N; and Fujita, K. (1989). "Vocal learning of Japanese and rhesus monkeys." ''Behaviour'': 191-199.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when another independent group was unable to reproduce these results, Masataka and Fujita's findings were questioned.&lt;ref name=owren /&gt; Adding to the evidence against vocal learning in [[non-human primates]] is the suggestion that regional differences in calls maybe be attributed to genetic differences between populations and not vocal learning.&lt;ref name=snowdon&gt;Snowdon, CT. (2009). "Plasticity of communication in non-human primates," in ''Advances in the Study of Behavior'', eds M. Naguib and V. M. Janik (Burlington, NJ: Academic Press), 239–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies argue that [[non-human primates]] do have some limited vocal learning ability, demonstrating that they can modify their vocalizations in a limited fashion through laryngeal control&lt;ref name=snowdon /&gt; and lip movements.&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = WD | last2 = Taglialatela | first2 = J | last3 = Leavens | first3 = DA. | year = 2007 | title = Chimpanzees differentially produce novel vocalizations to capture the attention of a human | url = | journal = Anim. Behav. | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 281–286 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.004| pmc = 1832264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wich&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wich | first1 = SA | last2 = Swartz | first2 = KB | last3 = Hardus | first3 = ME | last4 = Lameira | first4 = AR | last5 = Stromberg | first5 = E | last6 = Shumaker | first6 = RW. | year = 2009 | title = A case of spontaneous acquisition of a human sound by an orangutan | url = | journal = Primates | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1007/s10329-008-0117-y | pmid=19052691}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[chimpanzee]]s in both captivity and in the wild have been recorded producing novel sounds to attract attention. By puckering their lips and making a vibrating sounds, they can make a "raspberry" call, which has been imitated by both naïve captive and wild individuals.&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; There is also evidence of an [[orangutan]] learning to whistle by copying a human, an ability previously unseen in the species.&lt;ref name=wich /&gt; A cross-fostering experiment with [[marmoset]]s and [[macaque]]s showed convergence in pitch and other acoustic features in their supposedly innate calls,&lt;ref name=snowdon /&gt; demonstrating the ability, albeit limited, for vocal learning.

====Mice====
[[Mouse|Mice]] produce long sequences of vocalizations or "songs" that are used for both isolation calls in pups when cold or removed from nest and for [[courtship display|courtship]] when males sense a female or detect [[pheromones]] in their urine. These [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vocalizations consist of discrete syllables and patterns, with species-specific differences. Males tend to use particular syllable types that can be used to differentiate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holy | first1 = TE | last2 = Guo | first2 = Z. | year = 2005 | title = Ultrasonic songs of male mice | url = | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 12| page = e386 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030386 | pmid=16248680 | pmc=1275525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been intense debate on whether these songs are innate or learned. In 2011, Kikusui ''et al''. cross-fostered two strains of mice with distinct song [[phenotypes]] and discovered that strain-specific characteristics of each song persisted in the offspring, indicating that these vocalizations are innate.&lt;ref&gt;Kikusui, T; et al. (2011). "Cross fostering experiments suggest that mice songs are innate." ''PloS'' one 6.3: e17721.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later work by Arriaga et al. contradicted these results as their study found a motor cortex region active during singing, which projects directly to brainstem motor neurons and is also important for keeping songs stereotyped and on [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Vocal control by forebrain motor areas and direct cortical projections to vocal motor neurons are both features of vocal learning. Furthermore, male mice were shown to depend on auditory feedback to maintain some ultrasonic song features, and sub-strains with differences in their songs were able to match each other’s pitch when cross-housed under competitive social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arriaga|first=G |author2=Zhou E.P. |author3=Jarvis E.D.|title=Of Mice, Birds, and Men: The Mouse Ultrasonic Song System Has Some Features Similar to Humans and Song- Learning Birds|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e46610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046610|pmid=23071596|pmc=346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arriaga | first1 = G | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = ED. | year = 2013 | title = Mouse vocal communication system: Are ultrasounds learned or innate?. | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 124 | issue = 1| pages = 96–116 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2012.10.002| pmc = 3886250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this conflicting evidence, it remains unclear whether mice are vocal non-learners or limited vocal learners.

====Goats====
When [[goats]] are placed in different social groups, they modify their calls to show more similarity to that of the group, which provides evidence they may be limited vocal learners according to Erich Jarvis' continuum hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Arriaga 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arriaga | first1 = G. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = EP. | last3 = Jarvis | first3 = ED. | title = Of mice, birds, and men: the mouse ultrasonic song system has some features similar to humans and song-learning birds. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = e46610 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0046610 | pmid = 23071596 | pmc = 346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
As vocal learning is such a rare trait that evolved in distant groups, there are many theories to explain the striking similarities between vocal learners, especially within avian vocal learners.

===Adaptive advantage===
There are several proposed hypotheses that explain the selection for vocal learning based on environment and behavior. These include:&lt;ref name=jarvis2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Bird Song Systems: Evolution|journal=Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=2|pages=217–225.|doi=10.1016/b978-008045046-9.00935-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Individual identification: In most vocal-learning species, individuals have their own songs which serve as a unique signature to differentiate themselves from others in the population, which some suggest has driven selection of vocal learning. However, identification by voice, rather than by song or name, is present in vocal non-learners as well. Among vocal learners, only [[humans]] and maybe [[bottlenose dolphins]] actually use unique names. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual identification was a primary driving force for the [[evolution]] of vocal learning.
* Semantic communication: Semantic vocal communication associates specific vocalizations with animate or inanimate objects to convey a factual message. This hypothesis asserts that vocal learning evolved to facilitate enhanced communication of these specific messages as opposed to affective communication, which conveys emotional content. For example, humans are able to shout "watch out for that car!" when another is in danger while crossing the street instead of just making a noise to indicate urgency, which is less effective at conveying the exact danger at hand. However, many vocal non-learners, including [[chickens]] and velvet monkeys, have been shown to use their innate calls to communicate semantic information such as ‘a food source’ or 'predator.' Further discrediting this hypothesis is the fact that vocal learning birds also use innate calls for this purpose and only rarely use their learned vocalizations for semantic communication (for example, the [[grey parrot]] can mimic human speech and the black-capped chickadee uses calls to indicate predator size). As learned vocalizations rarely convey semantic information, this hypothesis also does not fully explain the evolution of vocal learning.
* Mate attraction and territory defense: While both vocal learners and non-learners use vocalizations to attract mates or defend territories, there is one key difference: variability. Vocal learners can produce more varied [[syntax]] and [[frequency modulation]], which have been shown to be preferred by females in [[songbirds]]. For example, [[Atlantic canary|canaries]] use two voices to produce large [[frequency modulation]] variations called "sexy syllables" or "sexy songs", which are thought to stimulate [[estrogen]] production in females. When vocal non-learner females were presented with artificially increased [[frequency modulation]]s in their innate vocalizations, more mating was stimulated. [[Sexual selection]] for greater variability, and thus in turn vocal learning, may then be a major driving force for the evolution of vocal learning.
* Rapid adaptation to sound propagation in different environments: Vocal non-learners produce their sounds best in specific habitats, making them more susceptible to changes in the environment. For example, pigeons' low-frequency calls travel best near the ground, and so communication higher in the air is much less effective. In contrast, vocal learners can change voice characteristics to suit their current environment, which presumably allows for better group communication.

===Predatory pressure===
With the many possible advantages outlined above, it still remains unclear as to why vocal learning is so rare. One proposed explanation is that predatory pressure applies a strong selective force against vocal learning.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt; If mates prefer more variable vocalizations, predators may also be more strongly attracted to more variable vocalizations. As innate calls are typically constant, predators quickly habituate to these vocalizations and ignore them as background noise. In contrast, the variable vocalizations of vocal learners are less likely to be ignored, possibly increasing the [[predation]] rate among vocal learners. In this case, relaxed predation pressure or some mechanism to overcome increased predation must first develop to facilitate the evolution of vocal learning. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that many mammalian vocal learners including [[human]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[elephant]]s have very few major predators. Similarly, several avian vocal learners have behaviors that are effective in avoiding predators, from the rapid flight and escape behavior of [[hummingbirds]] to predator mobbing in [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]].

While little research has been done in this area, some studies have supported the predation hypothesis. One study showed that Bengalese finches bred in captivity for 250 years without predation or human selection for singing behavior show increased variability in [[syntax]] than their conspecifics in the wild. A similar experiment with captive [[zebra finch]]es demonstrated the same result as captive birds had increased song variability, which was then preferred by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zann|first=RA|title=The Zebra Finch: A Synthesis of Field and Laboratory Studies|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these studies are promising, more research is needed in this area to compare predation rates across vocal learners and non-learners.

===Phylogeny===

====Birds====
[[File:Avian Tree.tiff|thumb|400px|Avian phylogenetic tree and the complex-vocal learning phenotype. Shown is an avian phylogenetic tree (based on: Hackett et al., 2008). Identified in red text and ∗ are three groups of complex-vocal learning birds. Below the figure are summarized three alternative hypotheses on the evolutionary mechanisms of complex-vocal learning in birds. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
Modern birds supposedly evolved from a common ancestor around the [[Cretaceous]]-Paleogene boundary at the time of the extinction of dinosaurs, about 66 million years ago. Out of the thirty [[Bird#Classification of modern bird orders|avian orders]], only three evolved vocal learning and all have incredibly similar forebrain structures despite the fact that they are distantly related (for example, [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]] are as distantly related as [[humans]] and [[dolphins]]). Phylogenetic comparisons have suggested that vocal learning evolved among birds at least two or three independent times, in [[songbirds]], [[parrots]], and [[hummingbirds]]. Depending on the interpretation of the trees, there were either three gains in all three lineages or two gains, in [[hummingbirds]] and the common ancestor of [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]], with a loss in the [[suboscine]] songbirds. There are several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;
* Independent convergent evolution: All three avian groups evolved vocal learning and similar neural pathways independently (not through a common ancestor). This suggests that there are strong [[epigenetic]] constraints imposed by the environment or morphological needs, and so this hypothesis predicts that groups that newly evolve vocal learning will also develop similar neural circuits.
* Common ancestor: This alternative hypothesis suggests that vocal learning birds evolved the trait from a distant common ancestor, which was then lost four independent times in interrelated vocal non-learners. Possible causes include high survival costs of vocal learning (predation) or weak adaptive benefits that did not induce strong selection for the trait for organisms in other environments. 
* Rudimentary structures in non-learners: This alternative hypothesis states that avian non-learners actually do possess rudimentary or undeveloped brain structures necessary for song learning, which were enlarged in vocal learning species. Significantly, this concept challenges the current assumption that vocal nuclei are unique to vocal learners, suggesting that these structures are universal even in other groups such as mammals.
* [[Motor theory of speech perception|Motor theory]]: This hypothesis suggests that cerebral systems that control vocal learning in distantly related animals evolved as specializations of a pre-existing motor system inherited from a common ancestor. Thus in avian vocal learners, each of the three groups of vocal learning birds evolved cerebral vocal systems independently, but the systems were constrained by a previous genetically determined motor system inherited from the common ancestor that controls learned movement sequencing. Evidence for this hypothesis was provided by Feenders and colleagues in 2008 as they found that [[EGR1]], an [[immediate early gene]] associated with increases in neuronal activity, was expressed in forebrain regions surrounding or directly adjacent to song nuclei when vocal learning birds performed non-vocal movement behaviors such as hopping and flying. In non-learners, comparable areas were activated, but without the adjacent presence of song nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feenders|first=G|author2=Liedvogel, M |author3=Rivas, M |author4=Zapka, M |author5= Horita, H |title=Molecular Mapping of Movement-Associated Areas in the Avian Brain: A Motor Theory for Vocal Learning Origin|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2008|volume=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001768 |pages=e1768 |pmid=18335043 |pmc=2258151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EGR1]] expression patterns were correlated with the amount of movement, just as its expression typically correlates with the amount of singing performed in vocal birds. These finding suggest that vocal learning brain regions developed from the same cell lineages that gave rise to the motor pathway, which then formed a direct projection onto the brainstem vocal motor neurons to provide greater control.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

Currently, it remains unclear as to which of these hypotheses is the most accurate.

====Primates====
[[File:Primate Tree.tiff|thumb|500px|Primate phylogenetic tree and complex-vocal learning vs. auditory sequence learning. Shown is a primate phylogenetic tree based on a combination of DNA sequence and fossil age data (Goodman et al., 1998; Page et al., 1999). Humans (Homo) are the only primates classified as “vocal learners.” However, non-human primates might be better at auditory sequence learning than their limited vocal-production learning capabilities would suggest. In blue text and (#) we highlight species for which there is some evidence of Artificial Grammar Learning capabilities for at least adjacent relationships between the elements in a sequence (tamarins: Fitch and Hauser, 2004), (macaques: Wilson et al., 2011). Presuming that the auditory capabilities of guenons and gibbons (or the symbolic learning of signs by apes) would mean that these animals are able to learn at least adjacent relationships in Artificial Grammars we can tentatively mark these species also in blue #. Note however, that for the species labeled in black text, future studies might show them to be capable of some limited-vocal learning or various levels of complexity in learning the structure of auditory sequences. Three not mutually exclusive hypotheses are illustrated for both complex-vocal learning and auditory sequence learning. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
In [[primates]], only [[humans]] are known to be capable of complex vocal learning.  Similar to the first hypothesis relating to birds, one explanation is that vocal learning evolved independently in humans. An alternative hypothesis suggests evolution from a primate common ancestor capable of vocal learning, with the trait subsequently being lost at least eight other times. Considering the most parsimonious analysis, it seems unlikely that the number of independent gains (one in humans) would be exceeded so greatly by the number of independent losses (at least eight), which supports the independent evolution hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

==Neurobiology==

===Neural pathways in avian vocal learners===

As avian vocal learners are the most amenable to experimental manipulations, the vast majority of work to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of vocal learning has been conducted with [[zebra finch]]es, with a few studies focusing on [[budgerigar]]s and other species. Despite variation in vocal learning phenotype, the [[Song control system|neural circuitry]] necessary for producing learned song is conserved in [[songbird]]s, [[parrot]]s, and [[hummingbird]]s. As opposed to their non-learner avian counterparts such as [[quail]], [[doves]], and [[pigeons]], these avian vocal learners contain seven distinct cerebral song nuclei, or distinct brain areas associated with auditory learning and [[Bird vocalizations|song production]] defined by their gene expression patterns. As current evidence suggests independent evolution of these structures, the names of each equivalent vocal nucleus are different per bird group, as shown in the table below.

Vocal nuclei are found in two separate brain pathways, which will be described in [[songbirds]] as most research has been conducted in this group, yet it should be noted that connections are similar in [[parrots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|author2=Mello CV |title=Molecular mapping of brain areas involved in parrot vocal communication|journal=J. Comp. Neurol.|year=2000|volume=419|pages=1–31|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(20000327)419:1&lt;1::aid-cne1&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hummingbirds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|author2=Ribeiro, S|author3=Da Silva, ML|author4=Ventura, D|author5=Vielliard, J|author6=Mello, CV|title=Behaviourally driven gene expression reveals song nuclei in hummingbird brain|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=406|pages=628–632|doi=10.1038/35020570|pmid=10949303|pmc=2531203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projections of the anterior vocal pathway in the [[hummingbird]] remain unclear and so are not listed in the table above.

The posterior vocal pathway (also known as vocal motor pathway), involved in the production of learned vocalizations, begins with projections from a nidopallial nucleus, the [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] in [[songbirds]]. The [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] then projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). The RA connects to the midbrain vocal center DM (dorsal medial nucleus of the [[midbrain]]) and [[Hypoglossal nerve|the brainstem (nXIIts) vocal motor neurons]] that control the muscles of the [[syrinx]], a direct projection similar to the projection from LMC to the [[nucleus ambiguus]] in humans&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Learned birdsong and the neurobiology of human language.|journal=Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.|year=2004|volume=1016|pages=749–777|doi=10.1196/annals.1298.038|pmc=2485240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] is considered the [[syntax]] generator while the RA modulates the acoustic structure of syllables. Vocal non-learners do possess the DM and twelfth motor neurons (nXIIts), but lack the connections to the [[arcopallium]]. As a result, they can produce vocalizations, but not learned vocalizations.

The anterior vocal pathway (also known as vocal learning pathway) is associated with learning, [[syntax]], and social contexts, starting with projections from the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to the striatal nucleus Area X. Area X then projects to the medial nucleus of dorsolateral thalamus (DLM), which ultimately projects back to MAN in a loop&lt;ref name="Schraff 1991 2896–2913"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraff|first=C|author2=Nottebohm F |title=A comparative study of the behavioral deficits following lesions of various parts of the zebra finch song system: implications for vocal learning|journal=J Neurosci|year=1991|volume=11|pages=2896–2913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lateral part of MAN (LMAN) generates variability in song, while Area X is responsible for stereotypy, or the generation of low variability in syllable production and order after song crystallization.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;

Despite the similarities in vocal learning neural circuits, there are some major connectivity differences between the posterior and anterior pathways among avian vocal learners. In [[songbirds]], the posterior pathway communicates with the anterior pathway via projections from the [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] to Area X; the anterior pathway sends output to the posterior pathway via connections from LMAN to RA and medial MAN (MMAN) to [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]]. [[Parrots]], on the other hand, have projections from the [[ventral]] part of the AAC (AACv), the parallel of the songbird RA, to the NAOc, parallel of the songbird MAN, and the oval nucleus of the mesopallium (MO). The anterior pathway in [[parrots]] connects to the posterior pathway via NAOc projections to the NLC, parallel of the [[songbird]] [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]], and AAC. Thus, [[parrots]] do not send projections to the [[striatum|striatal]] nucleus of the anterior pathway from their posterior pathway as do [[songbirds]]. Another crucial difference is the location of the posterior vocal nuclei among species. Posterior nuclei are located in auditory regions for songbirds, laterally adjacent to auditory regions in hummingbirds, and are physically separate from auditory regions in parrots. Axons must therefore take different routes to connect nuclei in different vocal learning species. Exactly how these connectivity differences affect song production and/or vocal learning ability remains unclear.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wild|first=JM|title=Neural pathways for the control of birdsong production|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1997|volume=33|pages=653–670|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19971105)33:5&lt;653::aid-neu11&gt;3.0.co;2-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An auditory pathway that is used for [[auditory learning]] brings auditory information into the vocal pathway, but the auditory pathway is not unique to vocal learners. Ear [[hair cells]] project to cochlear ganglia neurons to auditory pontine nuclei to [[midbrain]] and [[thalamus|thalamic]] nuclei and to primary and secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] areas. A descending auditory feedback pathway exists projecting from the dorsal [[nidopallium]] to the intermediate [[arcopallium]] to shell regions around the [[thalamus|thalamic]] and [[midbrain]] auditory nuclei. Remaining unclear is the source of auditory input into the vocal pathways described above. It is hypothesized that songs are processed in these areas in a hierarchical manner, with the primary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] area responsible for acoustic features (field L2), the secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] area (fields L1 and L3 as well as the caudal medial nidopallium or NCM) determining sequencing and discrimination, and the highest station, the caudal mesopallium (CM), modulating fine discrimination of sounds. Secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] areas including the NCM and CM are also thought to be involved in auditory memory formation of songs used for vocal learning, but more evidence is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;

===Critical period===
The development of the sensory modalities necessary for song learning occurs within a “[[critical period]]” of development that varies among avian vocal learners.  Closed-ended learners such as the [[zebra finch]] and aphantochroa [[hummingbird]] can only learn during a limited time period and subsequently produce highly stereotyped or non-variable vocalizations consisting of a single, fixed song which they repeat their entire lives. In contrast, open-ended learners, including [[Atlantic canary|canaries]] and various [[parrot]] species, display significant [[Synaptic plasticity|plasticity]] and continue to learn new songs throughout the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brenowitz|first=EA|author2=Beecher MD |title=Song learning in birds: diversity and plasticity, opportunities and challenges|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2005|volume=28|issue=3|pages=127–132|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.01.004|pmid=15749165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the male zebra finch, vocal learning begins with a period of sensory acquisition or [[auditory learning]] where juveniles are exposed to the song of an adult male “tutor” at about posthatch day 30 to 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eales|first=LA|title=Song learning in zebra finches: some effects of song model availability on what is learnt and when|journal=Anim Behav|year=1985|volume=33|pages=1293–1300|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this stage, juveniles listen and memorize the song pattern of their tutor and produce subsong, characterized by the production of highly variable syllables and syllable sequences. Subsong is thought to be analogous to [[babbling]] in human infants. Subsequently during the sensorimotor learning phase at posthatch day 35 to 90, juveniles practice the motor commands required for song production and use auditory feedback to alter [[Bird vocalizations|vocalizations]] to match the song template. Songs during this period are plastic as specific syllables begin to emerge but are frequently in the wrong sequence, errors that are similar to phonological mistakes made by young children when learning a language. As the bird ages, its song becomes more stereotyped until at posthatch day 120 the song syllables and sequence are crystallized or fixed. At this point, the zebra finch can no longer learn new songs and thus sings this single song for the duration of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=AE|author2=Ten-Cate C |author3=Slater PJB |title=Early experience and plasticity of song in adult male zebra finches|journal=J Comp Psychol|year=1996|volume=110|pages=354–369|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.110.4.354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neural mechanisms behind the closing of the [[critical period]] remain unclear, but early deprivation of juveniles from their adult tutors has been shown to extend the [[critical period]] of song acquisition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aamodt|first=SM |author2=Nordeen EJ |author3=Nordeen KW|title=Early isolation from conspecic song does not affect the normal developmental decline of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor binding in an avian song nucleus|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1995|volume=27|pages=76–84|doi=10.1002/neu.480270108}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Synapse selection” theories hypothesize that [[synaptic plasticity]] during the [[critical period]] is gradually reduced as [[dendritic spines]] are pruned through activity-dependent synaptic rearrangement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bischof|first=HJ|author2=Geissler E |author3=Rollenhagen A. |title=Limitations of the sensitive period for sexual imprinting: Neuroanatomical and behavioral experiments in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|year=2002|volume=133|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pruning of [[dendritic spines]] in the LMAN song nucleus was delayed in isolated [[zebra finch]]es with extended [[critical periods]], suggesting that this form of synaptic reorganization may be important in closing the [[critical period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallhausser-Franke|first=E |author2=Nixdorf-Bergweiler BE |author3=DeVoogd TJ|title=Song isolation is associated with maintaining high spine fre- quencies on zebra Wnch 1MAN neurons|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=1995|volume=64|pages=25–35|doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other studies have shown that birds reared normally as well as isolated juveniles have similar levels of dendritic pruning despite an extended [[critical period]] in the latter group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=JE|author2=Nordeen KW |author3=Nordeen EJ |title=Dissociation between extension of the sensitive period for avian vocal learning and dendritic spine loss in the song nucleus lMAN|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=2005|volume=83|pages=143–150|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2004.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that this theory does not completely explain [[critical period]] modulation.

Previous research has suggested that the length of the [[critical period]] may be linked to differential gene expression within song nuclei, thought to be caused by [[neurotransmitter]] binding of receptors during neural activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wada|first=K |author2=Sakaguchi H |author3=Jarvis ED |author4=Hagiwara M|title=Differential expression of glutamate receptors in avian neural pathways for learned vocalization|journal=J Comp Neurol|year=2004|volume=476|pages=44–64|doi=10.1002/cne.20201|pmc=2517240}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key area is the LMAN song nucleus, part of the specialized cortical-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in the anterior forebrain pathway, which is essential for vocal plasticity.&lt;ref name="Schraff 1991 2896–2913"/&gt; While inducing deafness in songbirds usually disrupts the sensory phase of learning and leads to production of highly abnormal song structures, lesioning of LMAN in [[zebra finch]]es prevents this song deterioration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainard|first=MS|author2=Doupe AJ |title=Postlearning consolidation of birdsong: stabilizing effects of age and anterior forebrain lesions|journal=J Neurosci|year=2001|volume=21|pages=2501–2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the earlier development of stable song. One of the neurotransmitter receptors shown to affect LMAN is the [[NMDA receptor|N- methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor]] (NMDAR), which is required for learning and activity-dependent gene regulation in the post-synaptic neuron. Infusions of the [[NMDAR antagonist]] [[AP5|APV]] (R-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) into the LMAN song nucleus disrupts the [[critical period]] in the [[zebra finch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basham ME|first=ME|author2=Nordeen EJ |author3=Nordeen KW |title=Blockade of NMDA receptors in the anterior   forebrain impairs sensory acquisition in the zebra finch (Poephila guttata)|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=1996|volume=66|pages=295–304|doi=10.1006/nlme.1996.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[NMDAR]] density and [[mRNA]] levels of the NR1 subunit also decrease in LMAN during early song development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=JE|author2=Singh TD|author3=Sohrabji F|author4=Nordeen KW|author5=Nordeen EJ|title=Developmental and hormonal regulation of NR2A mRNA in forebrain regions controlling avian vocal learning|journal=J.

Humans seem to have analogous anterior and posterior vocal pathways which are implicated in speech production and learning. Parallel to the avian posterior vocal pathway mentioned above is the motor cortico-brainstem pathway. Within this pathway, the face motor cortex projects to the nucleus ambiguous of the medulla, which then projects to the muscles of the [[larynx]]. Humans also have a vocal pathway that is analogous to the avian anterior pathway. This pathway is a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortico loop which begins at a strip of the [[premotor cortex]], called the cortical strip, which is responsible for speech learning and syntax production. The cortical strip includes spans across five brain regions: the anterior [[insular cortex|insula]], [[Broca’s area]], the anterior dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior pre-supplementary motor area, and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. This cortical strip has projections to the anterior [[striatum]] which projects to the [[globus pallidus]] to the anterior dorsal [[thalamus]] back to the cortical strip. All of these regions are also involved in [[syntax]] and speech learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Neural systems for vocal learning in birds and humans: a synopsis|journal=Journal of Ornithology|year=2007|volume=148|issue=1|pages=35–44|doi=10.1007/s10336-007-0243-0|pmc=2726745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic applications to humans==
In addition to the similarities in the neurobiological circuits necessary for vocalizations between animal vocal learners and humans, there are also a few genetic similarities. The most prominent of these genetic links are the [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] genes, which code for forkhead box (FOX) proteins P1 and P2, respectively. [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are [[transcription factors]] which play a role in the development and maturation of the lungs, heart, and brain,&lt;ref name="FOXP1 and FOXP2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pariani|first=MJ|author2=Spenser, A|author3=Graham Jr, JM|author4=Rimoin, DL|title=A 785 kb deletion of 3p14.1p13 including the FOXP1 gene, associated with speech delay, contractures, hypertonia and blepharophimosis|journal=European Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2009|volume=52|issue=2–3|pages=123–127|doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2009.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy" /&gt; and are also highly expressed in brain regions of the vocal learning pathway, including the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[frontal cortex]]. In these regions (i.e. the basal ganglia and frontal cortex), [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are thought to be essential for brain maturation and development of speech and language.&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vargha-Kahadem|first=F |author2=Gadian, DG |author3=Copp, A |author4=Mortimer, M|title=FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=131–138|doi=10.1038/nrn1605|pmid=15685218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthologues]] of [[FOXP2]] are found in a number of vertebrates including [[mice]] and [[songbirds]], and have been implicated in modulating [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of neural circuits. In fact, although mammals and birds are very distant relatives and diverged more than 300 million years ago, the [[FOXP2]] gene in [[zebra finch]]es and [[mice]] differs at only five [[amino acid]] positions, and differs between [[zebra finch]]es and [[humans]] at only eight [[amino acid]] positions. In addition, researchers have found that patterns of expression of [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are amazingly similar in the human fetal brain and the [[songbird]].&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy" /&gt;

These similarities are especially interesting in the context of the aforementioned avian song circuit. [[FOXP2]] is expressed in the avian Area X, and is especially highly expressed in the [[striatum]] during the [[critical period]] of song plasticity in [[songbirds]]. In humans, [[FOXP2]] is highly expressed in the [[basal ganglia]], [[frontal cortex]], and [[insular cortex]], all thought to be important nodes in the human vocal pathway. Thus, mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene are proposed to have detrimental effects on human speech and language, such as grammar, language processing, and impaired movement of the mouth, lips, and tongue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=K|author2=Liu, F |author3=Hirokawa, K |author4=Takahashi, H |title=Expression of FOXP2, a gene involved in speech and language, in the developing and adult striatum|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research|year=2003|volume=73|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1002/jnr.10638}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potential detrimental effects on song learning in [[songbirds]]. Indeed, [[FOXP2]] was the first gene to be implicated in the cognition of speech and language in a family of individuals with a severe speech and language disorder.

Additionally, it has been suggested that due to the overlap of [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] expression in [[songbirds]] and humans, mutations in [[FOXP1]] may also result in speech and language abnormalities seen in individuals with mutations in [[FOXP2]].&lt;ref name="FOXP1 and FOXP2" /&gt;

These genetic links have important implications for studying the origin of language because [[FOXP2]] is so similar among vocal learners and humans, as well as important implications for understanding the [[etiology]] of certain speech and language disorders in humans.

Currently, no other genes have been linked as compellingly to vocal learning in animals or humans.
