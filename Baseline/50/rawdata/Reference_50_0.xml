'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The website contains a database of meanings and expansions for [[abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s mainly in English but includes some entries in other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbis.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=ubos&amp;colors=&amp;ocolors=&amp;lett=fs&amp;tid=0&amp;titel_id=2223|title=Acronym Finder|date=|website=dbis.uni-regensburg.de|publisher=[[Universität Regensburg]]|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is freely accessible. The entries are further classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes which are shown on a Map along with location information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/blog/2017/04/03/e-tipp-der-woche-acronym-finder/|title=e-Tipp der Woche: Acronym Finder {{!}} [UB]log|website=blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations with multiple expansions are listed by popularity with the most common one being presented first, these can be sorted alphabetically as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/57676-acronym-finder|title=Acronym Finder - ExtremeTech|date=2001-09-05|work=ExtremeTech|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;GIRALDO ORTIZ, John Jairo.

Jul.-Dec. 2008, vol. 31, no. 2, p. 101-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can contribute to the database by submitting abbreviations and their meanings, these are reviewed by an by [[editing|editor]] and categorized before being added to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; While the database has been described as fairly accurate errors have been found in the meanings and expansions of abbreviations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The website does not list sources for the abbreviations and their meanings but it does identify people who have contributed more than 50 abbreviations to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The database only contains abbreviations and their expansions and does not list other data such as grammatical category, context, source, field of the abbreviation etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Farlex, Inc. the current owner of the website also publishes mobile apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acronym-finder-acronyms-abbreviations-initialisms-more/id1032748692?mt=8|title=Acronym Finder - Acronyms, Abbreviations, Initialisms, and more on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym Finder also includes a ''Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector'', a light-hearted tool that [[random]]ly generates jargon-like phrases and abbreviations — usually [[initialisms]] that would be unpronounceable as [[acronyms]] — and meanings from 30 cleverly chosen buzz words.

The website is supported through advertisements.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

==Reputation==
The website is listed as a quick reference tool in directories like Stanford Library, Library of Congress, USC Library.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556 &lt;nowiki&gt;Acronym finder [digital] : AF&lt;/nowiki&gt;]". ''searchworks.stanford.edu''. Stanford Libraries SearchWorks

"[https://www.loc.gov/rr/askalib/virtualref.html Virtual Reference Shelf] - Ask a Librarian". ''loc.gov''. Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited as the largest database of acronyms&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, D. &amp; Isern, D. Appl Intell (2011) 34: 312. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-009-0197-4&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in computational studies for its database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pto/papers/ciir/ir-186.pdf|title=Acrophile: An Automated Acronym Extractor and Server|last=Leah S.

Listings of abbreviations on the website have also been used as a defense that an abbreviation is in public use and cannot be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Patents Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrdCAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Bureau of National Affairs|page=1283}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in some trademark cases citations for AF have been accepted it has been described as an unreliable reference in others.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|title=CTM upheld after medical trade mark declared not to be descriptive|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2011|website=oami.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134443/http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|archive-date=November 23, 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has garnered criticism for the fact that anyone can submit abbreviations to the site and the content is user generated. Mike Molloy the site's original owner had defended that each submission is verified before being added to the database.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5808">'''Ask a Librarian''' is a live [[virtual reference]] service that offers online reference assistance to residents in the state of Florida. Ask a Librarian is an official service of the Florida Electronic Library and is administered by the [[Tampa Bay Library Consortium]] (TBLC).

Participating libraries provide users with virtual reference services via [[live chat]] software, text messaging, and e-mail forms which users can access through embedded links and widgets on their library’s official website. Live chat and text messaging are available from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to midnight EST from Sunday through Thursday, and from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on Friday and Saturday; the e-mail form is available to patrons 24 hours per day, seven days per week.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.askalibrarian.org/about|title=AskALibrarian.org: About|work=Ask A Librarian News and Information|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Ask a Librarian has 133 participating institutions including public libraries and library systems, K-12 libraries, and university and college libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.askalibrarian.org/participating-libraries/|title=Participating Libraries|website=Ask a Librarian News and Information|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ask a Librarian began as a partnership between the [[College Center for Library Automation]] (CCLA) and TBLC in the interest of creating a statewide virtual reference service that would increase the presence of librarians on the internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sachs|first=Diana|date=2005|title=Ask a Librarian: Florida’s Virtual Reference Service|url=|journal=Community &amp; Junior College Libraries|volume=12|issue=4|pages=51–52|doi=10.1300/J107v12n04_06|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=2016-03-18--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the organizations successfully applied for a joint grant through the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] (LSTA) and were awarded $339,000 for the development and implementation of their pilot project as a service of the [[Florida Electronic Library]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ask a Librarian virtual reference service was officially activated on July 28, 2003.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay-area]] libraries were the first to participate, with [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]] libraries joining shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:TTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FCC97A666F1382A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB5811D21E575|title=Librarians' Help Offered On Web|last=Richardson|first=Rachel|date=4 August 2003|newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune]]|page=4|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first year of operation, nearly 7,500 Floridians had used the service to get answers from a reference librarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:PBPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=104BB78A4408DBED&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB5811D21E575|title=Library offering live, on-line help with research|last=Haase|first=Linda|date=25 August 2004|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|page=1 (Neighborhood Post)|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, J. 2010"&gt;Ward, J., &amp; Barbier, P.

Ask a Librarian has made several efforts meet user reference needs on smartphones and other mobile devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27553">{{About|the Cold War-era abbreviation for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany)|the current country|Germany}}

'''BRD''' ({{lang-de|'''&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;undes&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;epublik &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;eutschland'''}}; English: Federal Republic of Germany); ({{Audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is an unofficial abbreviation commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|communist regime]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) to refer to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], informally known at the time as [[West Germany]]. The East German regime previously used the term "[[German Federal Republic]]" to refer to its western counterpart.

Unlike the [[English language|English]] equivalent '''FRG''', which was used as an [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country code]] and a [[List of FIFA country codes|FIFA trigramme]], the use of ''BRD'' was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory [[communist]] term.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40606777.html Wer BRD sagt, richtet Unheil an], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 25 September 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTThlFv55ksC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=R4upIEECw6&amp;dq=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;f=true ''Dialectics, Dogmas, and Dissent: Stories from East German Victims of Human Rights Abuse''], John Rodden, Penn State Press, 2010, page xi&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany.&lt;ref name="schulrecht"&gt;[http://www.schulrecht-sh.de/texte/b/brd.htm Erlass der Schulbehörde Schleswig-Holstein], RdErl. vom 4. Oktober 1976 (NBl. KM. Schl.-H. S. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; After [[German reunification]], the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (''{{lang|de|Deutschland}}''), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany was its [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "DE", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.

==History==
[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Allied occupation zones in post-war Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), French (blue)]]

===Background===
The official name was and is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' ("Federal Republic of Germany"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' ("Germany"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''Länder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Württemberg-Baden]], and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|"new states"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.

Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=duden+brd+1967&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or "West Germany" (abbreviated "WD") for the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;dq=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600&lt;/ref&gt; but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or "German Federal Republic" (abbreviated "DBR"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name "Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen für die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in East Germany===
This changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name ''BRD'' was introduced as a [[propaganda]] counter-term to the term ''DDR'', trying to express the equality of the states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Deutschland%20%E2%80%93%20ein%20Name%20im%20Wandel.%20Die%20deutsche%20Frage%20im%20Spiegel%20der%20Sprache&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=BRD&amp;f=false ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the West would speak of the ''sogenannte DDR'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html Vom Sogenannten], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 21 October 1968, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; or "so-called 'DDR'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;dq=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-M_NkMnKAhXEPxoKHUj4BrIQ6AEIIDAA ''Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany''], 1959 - Germany (West), page 20&lt;/ref&gt; when it had to be belittled.

At that time, the initialism ''BRD'' had been adopted by ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]'s daily newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nd-archiv.de/ausgabe/1970-12-08 ''Neues Deutschland'', 8 December 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms ''Deutschland'' ("Germany") and ''deutsch'' ("German") in a number of terms, for example:

However, the ruling party's full name, ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or "Socialist Unity Party of Germany" remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' ("New Germany") .

[[File:DDR_international_vehicle_registration_oval.svg|thumb|upright|DDR international vehicle registration oval, used between 1974 and 1990.]]
Therefore,  using the abbreviation ''BRD'' fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|vehicle registration code]] ''D'', hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for ''DDR'' and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41667247.html Kennzeichen BÄÄH], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 12 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was rejected by the West, where some motorists  displayed bumper stickers with the slogan ''BRD - Nein Danke!'' ("BRD? No Thanks!").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkI3mUhsrDQC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;ots=l0RQx0j75Q&amp;dq=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;f=false ''Kontroverse Begriffe: Geschichte des öffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Georg Stötzel, Martin Wengeler
Walter de Gruyter, 1995, page 320&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;
 
As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' ("Federal Republic", or "Federal Territory") to refer to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' ("Federal Citizen[s]") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective ''bundesdeutsch'' ([[Federal Germans|federally German]]).

===Opposition to use in West Germany===
To distance themselves from the term ''BRD'', until [[German reunification]], the [[Cabinet of Germany|government of the Federal Republic of Germany]] and media sometimes used the abbreviations ''BR Deutschland,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7SQun-nAqJAC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=BR%20Deutschland&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q=BR%20Deutschland&amp;f=false ''Konfession und Wahlverhalten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Karl Schmitt, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1989, page 307&lt;/ref&gt; ''BR-Dt.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJeAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22BR+Dt.%22+deutschland&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22BR+Dt.%22+ ''Deutschland-Jahrbuch, Volume 2''], Klaus Mehnert, Heinrich Schulte

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004665-0003, Walter Hallstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Hallstein]]
West Germany had always claimed to be ''the'' Germany, and did not like the comparison to ''DDR'', or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after [[Walter Hallstein]], State secretary at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1989/sep/15/berlinwall.germany The Two Germanies: Rivals struggle for Germany's soul - As worries surface in Bonn about the influx from the East, there are anxieties across Europe about the likely economic and international effects], ''[[The Guardian]]', 15 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an [[exclusive mandate]] over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established ''de facto'' diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] in 1972, [[Bonn]] and [[East Berlin]] exchanged "permanent missions",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/.../Start/Index/id/652004 History of the Berlin Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by "permanent representatives",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0908/090859.html East-West German trade up 8 percent] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 8 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''de jure'' embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations]], to which the East German mission was accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFK7RkdQG14C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Ministry+of+Intra-German+Relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TeP4ln6BSF&amp;sig=kapXyUfDiTZORzMuCqPzs9Rzm10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWtKGmxMvKAhUDwxQKHWR-AewQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=true ''Germany Divided: From the Wall to Reunification''], A. James McAdams
Princeton University Press, 1994, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;ots=CdUG2w_KQz&amp;dq=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=false ''Detente in Europe: Real or Imaginary?''], Josef Korbel, Princeton University Press, 2015, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending that the use of ''BRD'' be avoided.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] agreed not to use the initialism.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, "Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»", in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.)], No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of [[Bavaria]], forbidden it.&lt;ref name="preute"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9KEttd2OaPAC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;f=false ''Rechts um--zum Abitur: der geistige Wandel an deutschen Oberschulen''], Michael Preute
Ch. Links Verlag, 1995, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be ''nicht wünschenswert'' or "undesirable".&lt;ref name="schulrecht" /&gt; The [[Kultusministerkonferenz|conference of all the states ministers for school education]] decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; with pupils being required to write ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' in full and use of the term being deemed an error.&lt;ref name="preute" /&gt; The different usages were so ingrained that one could [[Shibboleth|deduce]] a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4QnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brd+imperialismus&amp;dq=brd+imperialismus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt_7HTuMnKAhWKXRQKHdw9De4Q6AEIKjAB ''Kampf dem BRD-Imperialismus''], Liga gegen den Imperialismus, 1972, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

==Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany==
[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|thumb|Map of divided Berlin, indicating by the broken line at Berlin's western border the territorial redeployment decided by the Allies.]]
A similar ideological question was the question whether to use "Berlin (West)" (the officially preferred name) or "West Berlin", and even whether to write "West Berlin" in [[German language|German]] as two hyphenated words - ''West-Berlin'' - or as one word - ''Westberlin''.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7kGqJGbaI4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Berlin+(West)%22+westberlin+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic28LjsMbKAhVFvRoKHRFoCQwQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Berlin%20(West)%22%20westberlin%20name&amp;f=true ''Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police''], Andreas Glaeser
University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Westerners called the [[West Berlin|Western sectors]] "Berlin", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin ''Groß-Berlin'' or "Greater Berlin",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Article 127 [Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}
Within one year after promulgation of this Basic Law the Federal Government, with the consent of the governments of the Länder concerned, may extend to the Länder of Baden, Greater Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and Württemberg Hohenzollern any law of the Administration of the Combined Economic Area, insofar as it remains in force as federal law under Article 124 or 125.]&lt;/ref&gt; but changed this "Berlin (West)", although it also used the hyphenated "West-Berlin". However, the East German government commonly referred to it as "Westberlin".&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term ''Democratic Berlin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;pg=PA344#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Berlin", by East Germany, and "Berlin (Ost)" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included ''Ost-Berlin'' and ''Ostberlin'' (both meaning "East Berlin") as well as ''Ostsektor'' or "Eastern Sector".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FMmOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;dq=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif8MfN8sjKAhVJPRQKHXPQA_EQ6AEI3AEwGw ''Der Rechtsstatus des Landes Berlin''], Ernst Renatus Zivier, Berlin Verlag, 1974, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' using "Ost-Berlin" and the centre-left ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' using "Ostberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ost+Berlin%22,+%22Ostberlin%22,+or+%22Ostsektor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dUlLgVcMcg&amp;sig=yg5HL2-Z23u3emp_z7D_ikH9sc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoo6r-yrbKAhWGwxQKHeiNBxIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ost%20Berlin%22%2C%20%22Ostberlin%22%2C%20or%20%22Ostsektor%22&amp;f=true ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names [[Middle Germany|''Mitteldeutschland'' ("Middle Germany")]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv_GCXcA8IYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;ots=H0OlpCONF6&amp;dq=%22BRd%22%20mitteldeutschland&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=mitteldeutschland&amp;f=false ''Die Agrarpolitik in Mitteldeutschland: und ihre Auswirkung auf Produktion und Verbrauch landwirtschaftlicher Erzeugnisse''], Edgar Tümmler, Konrad Merkel, Georg Blohm, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone)]] abbreviated as ''SBZ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8uGOqBCek8C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=sbz%20deutschland&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=sbz%20deutschland&amp;f=true ''Das Widerstandsrecht: Entwickelt anhand d. höchstrichterl.

In 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent [[Slovakia]], as Germany objected to the use of the [[Slovak language]] name ''Nemecká spolková republika'' (literally  "German Federal Republic") owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of ''Spolková republika Nemecko''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_20393-544-2-30.pdf?100831124854 Proven Partnerships with Development Potential: Germany’s relations with the Czech Republic and Slovakia], Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung, September 2010, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost identical to the equivalent ''Spolková republika Německo'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], a language closely related to Slovak,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/encyklopedie_statu/evropa/nemecko/ Německo], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt; but the Slovak authorities claimed that "Federal Republic of Germany" could not be translated grammatically into Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/semantic-spat-pits-german-against-slovak/336090.html Semantic Spat Pits German Against Slovak], ''[[Moscow Times]]'', Tony Barber, 10 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Government of Slovakia|Slovak government]] had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper ''Narodna Obroda'' that they were using "German Federal Republic" to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/name-calling-upsets-the-federal-republic-1594837.html Name-calling upsets the Federal Republic], ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[Image:Immanuel Bekker - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|August Immanuel Bekker]]

'''Bekker numbering''' or '''Bekker pagination''' is the standard form of citation to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum|works of Aristotle]].  It is based on the page numbers used in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] edition of the complete works of [[Aristotle]] and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical [[philology|philologist]] [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1785-1871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name '''Berlin numbering''' or '''Berlin pagination'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', ex recognitione Immanuelis Bekkeri, 5 voll. Berlin,  Georgium Reimerum, 1831-1870 (the last volume contains the ''Index Aristotelicus'' by [[Hermann Bonitz]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition).  For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] is ''1094a1'', which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnes, ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'', Cambridge 1995 xxi&lt;/ref&gt;.

All modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers.  Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.

While Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Thomist]] scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to the works of [[Plato]], and [[Diels-Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the ''Corpus Aristotelicum'' regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.

== Aristotle's works by Bekker numbers ==

The following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', edited by [[Jonathan Barnes]], 2 vols., Princeton University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.

== Aristotelian works lacking Bekker numbers ==

===''Constitution of the Athenians''===
The ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' (or ''Athenaiōn Politeia'') was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the [[British Museum]].  The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.

===Fragments&lt;!--linked from 'Valentin Rose (classicist)'--&gt;===
Surviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Valentin Rose]].  These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of [[Aristotle]] was ''Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus'' (1863).  As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the [[Teubner]] series, ''[https://archive.org/details/aristotelisquif00arisgoog Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta]'', Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by ''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in [[Walter de Gruyter]]'s reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by [[Eckart Schütrumpf]] is in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle CU-Boulder Expert Wins $75,000 Award For Research On Aristotle,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233125/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle |date=2016-04-18 }} University of Colorado Office of News Services, December 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, ''Select Fragments'' ([https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft Oxford 1952]), and [[Jonathan Barnes]] (ed.), ''The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation'', vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;2384–2465.

The works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues ''On Philosophy'' (or ''On the Good''), ''Eudemus'' (or ''On the Soul''), ''On Justice'', and ''On Good Birth''.  The possibly spurious work, ''[[On Ideas]]'' survives in quotations by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.  For the dialogues, see also the editions of [[Richard Rudolf Walzer]], ''Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum'' (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, ''Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi'' (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.

==Types==
Show bibles are updated with information on the characters after the information has been established on screen.&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Espenson |first1=Jane |title=How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized |url=http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php |website=JaneEspeson.com |accessdate=2013-10-26 |date=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[Frasier]]'' show bible was "scrupulously maintained", and anything established on air — "the name of [[Frasier Crane|Frasier's]] mother, [[Niles Crane|Niles']] favorite professor, [[Martin Crane|Martin's]] favorite bar...even a list of [[Maris Crane|Maris]]' [dozens of] food allergies" — was reflected in the bible.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; The updated bible then serves as a resource for writers to keep everything within the series consistent.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; 

Other show bibles are used as sales documents to help a [[television network]] or [[television studio|studio]] understand a series, and are sometimes given to new writers when they join the writing staff for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; These types of bibles discuss the backstories of the main characters and the history of the series' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

Television series often rely on writers' assistants and [[script coordinator]]s to serve as "walking bibles" in remembering details about a series.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

==Writers Guild of America==
In the United States, writing the show bible of a produced series earns that writer the 24 units of required credit necessary to qualify for membership in the [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Become a Member |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=84 |website=Writers Guild of America West |accessdate=2013-10-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">A '''breviograph''' or '''brevigraph''' (from {{lang-la|brevis}}, short, and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''grapho'', to write) is a type of [[scribal abbreviation]] in the form of an easily written symbol, character, flourish or stroke, based on a modified letter form to take the place of a common letter combination, especially those occurring at the beginning or end of a word. Breviographs were used frequently by stenographers, law clerks and scriveners, and they were also found in early printed books and tracts.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Samuel A. ''The Handwriting of the Renaissance'' (1931), New York: Columbia UP, 125-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Their use declined after the 17th century.

The abbreviation '''cf.''' (short for the {{lang-la|confer/conferatur}}, both meaning "compare")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=cf.|work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=n.d.|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cf|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. It is used to form a contrast, for example: "Abbott (2010) found supportive results in her memory experiment, unlike those of previous work (cf. Zeller &amp; Williams, 2007)."&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite|title=It’s All Latin to Me: Latin Abbreviations in Scholarly Writing|first=Chelsea|date=May 13, 2010|website=APA Style Blog|publisher=American Psychological Association|last=Lee|url=http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/05/its-all-latin-to-me.html|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that "cf." be used only to suggest a comparison, and the word "see" be used to point to a source of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Latin Terms and Abbreviations|website=The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|date=n.d.|url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/latin-terms-and-abbreviations/|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msupress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ContagionStyleSheet.pdf |title=Chicago Manual of Style 15th Ed.

==Biological use==
In [[Open nomenclature|biological naming conventions]], cf. is commonly placed between the [[genus name]] and the [[species name]] to describe a specimen that is difficult to identify because of practical difficulties, such as the specimen being poorly preserved. For example, "''{{lang|la|Barbus}}'' cf. ''{{lang|la|holotaenia}}''" indicates that the specimen is in the genus ''[[Barbus]]'', and believed to be ''{{lang|la|[[Barbus holotaenia]]}}'' but the actual species-level identification cannot be certain.&lt;ref name="Bengtson"/&gt;

Cf. can also be used to express a possible identity, or at least a significant resemblance, such as between a newly observed specimen and a known [[species]] or [[taxon]].&lt;ref name="Bengtson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bengtson |first=Peter |title=Open Nomenclature |url=http://cdn.palass.org/publications/palaeontology/volume_31/pdf/vol31_part1_pp223-227.pdf |work=Palaeontology |accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a usage might suggest a specimen's membership of the same genus or possibly of a shared higher taxon, such as in, "{{lang|la|Diptera: Tabanidae}}, cf. ''{{lang|la|Tabanus}}''", where the author is confident of the order and family ([[Diptera]]: [[Tabanidae]]), but can only offer the genus (''[[Tabanus]]'') as a suggestion and has no information favouring a particular species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Anne|last=Hartmann|url=http://www.assess-hkh.at/downloads/Field_Key_HKH_draft.pdf|title=Field Key for Selected Benthic Invertebrates from the HKH Region|version=Daft Version|date=February 2007|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
''See also'': [[History of genomics]]

Comparative genomics has a root in the comparison of [[virus]] genomes in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt; For example, small [[RNA viruses]] infecting animals ([[picornaviruses]]) and those infecting plants ([[cowpea mosaic virus]]) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 12| issue = 18| pages = 7251–7267| authors = Argos, P.; Kamer, G.; Nicklin, M.J.; Wimmer, E.| title = Similarity in gene organization and homology between proteins of animal picornaviruses and a plant comovirus suggest common ancestry of these virus families| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| year = 1984| doi = 10.1093/nar/12.18.7251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of [[varicella-zoster virus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] that contained more than 100 genes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 14| issue = 10| pages = 4281–4292| first1 = D.J.|last1= McGeoch

The first complete genome sequence of a cellular organism, that of ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' Rd, was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of ''Haemophilus influenzae'' Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |year=1995 | doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/269/5223/496 |pmid=7542800|bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second genome sequencing paper was of the small parasitic bacterium ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' published in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Claire M. |year=1995 |title=The Minimal Gene Complement of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5235 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5235.397 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=7569993|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 1995Sci...270..397F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from this paper, reports on new genomes inevitably became comparative-genomic studies.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt;

The first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called  [[MUMmer|MUMMER]] and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms.  In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.

With the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including [[Human Genome Project|human]], the [[Japanese pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu rubripes]]'', and [[House mouse|mouse]], precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a [[genome browser]].

[[Next-generation sequencing]] methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] by mapping [[Sequence assembly|unassembled reads]] against a well [[Genome annotation|annotated]] reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.&lt;ref name=hu/&gt;

==Evolutionary principles==
One character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.

Similarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour ([[synteny]]), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.

Orthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for  collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.

[[File:BrowserFoxp2.jpg| Human [[FOXP2]] gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in and multiple alignment (at bottom of figure) in this image from the [[UCSC Genome Browser]].  Note that conservation tends to cluster around coding regions (exons). |thumb|right]]
Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the [[proteins]], [[RNA]], and [[regulatory regions]] of different organisms to infer how [[Selection (biology)|selection]] has acted upon these elements.  Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different [[species]] should be conserved through time ([[stabilizing selection]]), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent ([[Directional selection|positive selection]]).  Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).

One of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small [[model organisms]] (for example the model [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] and closely related [[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, L.D. |year=2003 |title=The genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae: a platform for comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=E45 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000045 |pmid=14624247 |pmc=261899|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Newly Sequenced Worm a Boon for Worm Biologists | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = e4–e4 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000044}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymorphisms==
===Single nucleotide polymorphisms===

SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) refers to the genome level by single nucleotide position, such as transformation or transversion mutation caused the DNA sequence polymorphism. According to the SNP in gene location, it can be divided into 3 classes: the genes code area SNP (coding - region SNPS, cSNP), gene surrounding SNP (perigenic SNPS, pSNP) and gene SNP (intergenic SNPS, iSNP). Published on February 17, 2005, the first human gene polymorphisms mapping is based on gene "linkage disequilibrium theory", using gene chip in 71 European Americans (white), African Americans (black) and the han Chinese Americans (yellow race), this research identified 1.58 million single nucleotide mutation of DNA locus, the map will help to predict the likelihood of certain diseases and make the best treatment plan, make an important step in the journey which based on gene of individualized health goals.

===Copy number polymorphism===
Before the invention of whole genome sequencing and gene chip technology, limited by high-throughput DNA genome copy number detection means, within the scope of the whole genome copy number polymorphism (copy number polymorphism, CNP), people know very little about the number and distribution. In 2004, a number of "human genome project" research bases in the world accidentally found that in the phenotypes of normal population, there are some differences in some gene copy numbers between different individuals, some people lost a lot of gene copy, while others have extra, extend the copies of the gene, the researchers call this phenomenon of “polymorphic gene copy number". It was because the CNP that caused the different between individuals such as disease, appetite and efficacy. Research shows that it has average 11 differences between 2 individuals, the average length of CNP is 465 KB, of which more than half of the CNP are repeated in more than one individual, and often in other types of chromosome rearrangement nearby.

==Classification==
===Interspecific comparative genomics===
Through the comparison of different related species genome sequence, can identify coding sequences, regulation and control of non-coding sequences and unique sequence of a given species. And within the scope of genome sequence alignment, can understand the similarities and differences in gene sequence, nucleotide composition, linear relationship of different objects, and then get the aspects of information about forecasts and positioning of genetic analysis, evolutionary relationship between biological systems.

===Intraspecific comparative genomics===
With same population in genome，there are a lot of mutation and polymorphism, because of these differences in the genome sequence constitutes the different disease susceptibility and genetic basis of different reactions to drugs and environmental factors in individuals and groups.

==Tools==

Computational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Bergman, N.H. |title=Comparative Genomics: Volumes 1 and 2 |location=Totowa, New Jersey |publisher=Humana Press |year=2007 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1732/ |isbn=978-193411-537-4 |pmid=21250292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice [[landrace]]s revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, [[amylose]] content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, X.H.  |year=2010 |title=Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces  |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=11 |page=961-U76 |doi=10.1038/ng.695 |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Morrell, P.L., Buckler, E.S., Ross-Ibara, J. |year=2012 |title=Crop genomics: advances and applications |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=85–96 |doi=10.1038/nrg3097}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as [[reverse vaccinology]], researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seib, K.L., Zhao, X., Rappuoli, R. |year=2012 |title=Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=18 |issue=SI |pages=109–116 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for [[Streptococcus agalactiae|Group B Streptococcus]], a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maione, D.  |year=2005 |title=Identification of a Universal Group B Streptococcus Vaccine by Multiple Genome Screen |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5731 |pages=148–150 |doi=10.1126/science.1109869 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..148M |pmid=15994562 |pmc=1351092}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasco, D.A.  |year=2008 |title=The pangenome structure of Escherichia coli: Comparative genomic analysis of E-coli commensal and pathogenic isolates  |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=20 |pages=6881–6893 |doi=10.1128/JB.00619-08|display-authors=etal |pmid=18676672 |pmc=2566221}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Comparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rodgers J.; Gibbs R.A. |year=2014 |title=Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Comparative primate genomics: emerging patterns of genome content and dynamics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1038/nrg3707|pmc=4113315 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six [[Hominidae|great ape]] species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prado-Martinez, J.  |year=2013 |title=Great ape genetic diversity and population history |journal=Nature |volume=499 |issue=7459 |pages=471–475 |doi=10.1038/nature12228 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2013Natur.499..471P }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng, J.; Konopa, G.; Hunt, B.G.; Preuss, T.M.; Geschwind, D.; Yi, S.V. |year=2012 |title=Divergent Whole-Genome Methylation Maps of Human and Chimpanzee Brains Reveal Epigenetic Basis of Human Regulatory Evolution |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.07.024 |pmid=22922032 |pmc=3511995}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional wrestling]] and [[mixed martial arts]] (Also known as MMA) both combine [[grappling]] and [[strike (attack)|strikes]]. In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often [[scripted]] or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA.

==Comparison==
Professional wrestling could be considered a [[performance art]] which combines [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] with [[Performing arts|theatrical performance]].&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling |work=Mythologies |year=1957 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of [[amateur wrestling]], striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a "worked" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century [[Europe]] as a carnival attraction.

Mixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including [[wrestling]], [[boxing]] and [[Martial Arts]], such as [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]. The early 1990s saw the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] popularize the term "Mixed Martial Arts", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/mma-dragon-sleeper-finish-video/ | title=An MMA Fighter Won A Fight With A Shoot Dragon Sleeper | work=Uproxx.com | date=November 12, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Hanstock, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is [[Brock Lesnar]], who has won the world championships in both the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Couture|date=September 2, 2008|last=Spade|first=Bobby|accessdate=September 2, 2008|publisher=NoDQ.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906152912/http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|archivedate=September 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/19/16793746/ufc-brock-lesnar-return-wwe-jim-ross-pro-wrestling-mma-news | title=Jim Ross: Fans are ‘jonesing’ for Lesnar’s UFC return because MMA is lacking superstars right now | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=December 19, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Ordoñez, Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include [[Bobby Lashley]] ([[Shark Fights#Current champions|Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship]]&lt;ref name="Shark-Win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2011/11/12/bobby-lashley-wins-mma-title-in-lubbock/|title=Bobby Lashley wins MMA title in Lubbock|publisher=Gerweck.net|first=Steve|last=Gerweck|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Impact Global Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0811/615430/tna-impact-wrestling-results/|title=TNA Impact Wrestling Results (8/11): Damien Sandow TNA Debut, Titles Vs.

===Rivalry===
Since MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession. This can be an attack on the sport as a whole, or acting as a fan dismissing certain actions within that sport.&lt;ref name="BloodyElbow"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/18/16793536/ufc-daniel-cormier-disses-pro-wrestling-spots-gets-into-twitter-beef-with-cody-rhodes-mma-news | title=Daniel Cormier disses pro wrestling spots, gets into Twitter beef with Cody Rhodes | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=Dec 18, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Burke, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en-crop.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map of a segment of Antarctica, identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both [[Roald Amundsen]] (leading his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]]) and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (leading the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) reached the [[South Pole]] within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the [[geographic south pole]] first and subsequently return to their base camp at [[Framheim]] without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.

== Overview ==
The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.
*Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.
*Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.
*Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of [[Hjalmar Johansen]]) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.

Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed,&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; including:

* Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles— I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season—an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cherry Garrard in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'' agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry Garrard, ''The Worst Journey in the World'', chapter 19 "The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier]."&lt;/ref&gt;
* With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that [[#Food and fuel|the rations of Scott's team were inadequate]] and did not provide enough energy for the men.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIX, page 573.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.
* Ponies' coats easily became soaked with [[perspiration]] during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.
* The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant [[Seal meat|seal]] and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.  
* Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&amp;nbsp;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&amp;nbsp;miles short of there. Scott's party died  11&amp;nbsp;miles south of the depot.
* The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again.
* The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite book|last= Preston|first= Diana|title= A First Rate Tragedy|publisher= Constable &amp; Co.|location= London|year= 1997|pages= 218–219|isbn= 0-09-479530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."
* The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.
* The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": "...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather...."
* The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; he states "Man is a poor [[pack animal|beast of burden]], as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

== Objectives of the expeditions ==
Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&amp;nbsp;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&amp;nbsp;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, [[Henry Robertson Bowers]], and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to [[Cherry-Garrard]].

Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under [[Kristian Prestrud]] who conducted an expedition to [[King Edward VII Land]] while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.

== Base camps ==
Amundsen camped on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] at the [[Bay of Whales]] which is 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350&amp;nbsp;miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's base was at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]], with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transport ==
=== Motor sledges ===
The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&amp;nbsp;—dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander [[Reginald William Skelton]]&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910"&gt;Letter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|E.R.G.R. "Teddy" Evans]] as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition.&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910" /&gt; Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to R W Skelton from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ponies vs dogs ===
Scott had used dogs on his first ([[Discovery Expedition|Discovery]]) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his [[Nimrod expedition]] that got to within {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, [[Lawrence Oates]], whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Susan|title=The Coldest March: Scott`s Fatal Antarctic Expedition|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300089678|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-March-Scott-s-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0300089678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764466&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|85}}

There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of [[William Speirs Bruce]] in his Arctic, Antarctic, and [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], Amundsen in the ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition, [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s crossing of [[Greenland]], [[Robert Peary]]'s three attempts at the [[North Pole]], [[Eivind Astrup]]'s work supporting Peary, [[Frederick Cook]]'s discredited North Pole expedition, and [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s explorations of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take "dogs, dogs and more dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = Carl | date = October 2008 | title = The use and abuse of dogs on Scott's and Amundsen's South Pole expeditions | journal = The Polar Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–311 | issn = 0032-2474 | doi=10.1017/s0032247408007493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.'&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed "reluctance" to use dogs in this way: "One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | year = 1962 | title = The South Pole Fifty Years After | url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3571/3546|journal = Arctic | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–178 | doi=10.14430/arctic3571}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = L G | title = The Logistics of the Polar Journeys of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen | date = January 1972 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–47 | pmid = 4552519 | pmc=1644311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they "also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal".&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the [[Inuit]] while on his ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the [[Antarctic]] while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

=== Walking vs skiing on snow ===
Scott took the Norwegian [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] and [[skier]] [[Tryggve Gran]] to the [[Antarctic]] on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.

Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that "Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event".&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, [[Olav Bjaaland]], as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the [[South Pole]].

== Weather conditions ==
Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Simpson]], Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|286}} The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer [[Edgar Evans]] and [[Lawrence Oates]] had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were {{Convert|11|mi|order=flip}} short of One-Ton Depot, which was {{Convert|140|mi|order=flip}} from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.

On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly {{Convert|300|mi|4=-2|order=flip}} in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also blamed "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a "normal" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|318-319}}

== Route marking and depot laying ==
During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) {{Convert|180|mi|order=flip}} of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter X, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.

Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.

== Food and fuel ==
By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573" /&gt; A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the [[BBC]], confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, Blizzard&amp;nbsp;– Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-563-49326-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.

Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]]'s trip with [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard|Cherry-Garrard]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.

Since the rations contained no [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin C|C vitamins]], the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs.  This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntford|first1=Roland|title=The Last Place on Earth|date=1985|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd|location=London|isbn=0340381019|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Place-Earth-Roland-Huntford/dp/0340381019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764934&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553}}

Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.

== Clothing and goggles ==
It has been said (by the present-day explorer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.

Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.

Scott's team suffered regularly from [[snow blindness]] and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.

== Delay in meeting Scott's returning party ==
In 1921, [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|'Teddy' Evans]] wrote in his book ''South with Scott'' that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.{{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;...It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}}}}

He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.

He continued his instructions in the next paragraph "You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173&lt;/ref&gt; with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.

Expedition member [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book ''The Worst Journey in the World''. However, in the 1948 preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gray |first = Richard | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and [[Edward L. Atkinson|Edward Atkinson]] reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}} Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler [[Cecil Meares]] had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".

On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at [[Hut Point]] when, on 19 February, [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Edward Evans]] was lying seriously ill in a tent some {{Convert|35|mi|order=flip|round=5}} to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals&lt;/ref&gt;  Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.

Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]]. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to "use his judgement" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.

On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."

Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.){{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

== Other reasons for Scott's failure ==
; Geology samples
: Scott's team continued to haul over 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, {{ISBN|0-340-82697-5}}-page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tryggve Gran]] on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, {{ISBN|0-340-38101-9}}, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Final five-man team
: Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360&amp;nbsp;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.
; Misuse of the dog team
: For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&amp;nbsp;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428" /&gt; He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within {{Convert|100|km|4=-1}} of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.
; Navigation
: Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a [[sextant]] during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a [[theodolite]] which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|482}} Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|473, 538}}
; Camp routine
: Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

A '''compendium''' (plural: '''compendia''') is a concise compilation of a [[Body of knowledge|body]] of [[knowledge]]. A compendium may summarize a larger work. In most cases the body of knowledge will concern a specific field of human interest or endeavour (for example: [[hydrogeology]], [[logology]], [[ichthyology]], [[phytosociology]] or [[myrmecology]]), while a general [[encyclopedia]] can be referred to as a ''compendium of all human knowledge''.

The word compendium arrives from the Latin word "compenso", meaning "to weigh together or balance". The 21st century has seen the rise of democratized, online compendia in various fields.{{verification needed|date=May 2017}}
{{Wiktionary}}

==Examples==
An example would be the ''Compendium of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', a concise 598-question-and-answer book which summarises the teachings of the Catholic Faith and Morals.&lt;ref&gt;''Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (USCCB 2005), 200 pages, English hardcover {{ISBN|978-1-57455-720-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible]] is another example of a compendium—a group of many writings of the prophets and apostles over a period of time, whose books are put together to form the Old Testament and the New Testament.

Some well known literary figures have written their own compendium. An example would be [[Alexandre Dumas]], author of [[The Three Musketeers]], and an enthusiastic gourmand. His compendium on food titled ''From Absinthe to Zest'' serves as an alphabet for food lovers.

The [[bestiary]], popular in the Middle Ages, is another example of a compendium. Bestiaries cataloged animals and facts about natural history and were particularly popular in England and France around the 12th century.

'''Digital reference''' (or '''virtual reference''') is a service by which a [[library]] reference service is conducted online, and the reference transaction is a [[computer-mediated communication]]. It is the remote, NextNextcomputer-mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word "[[reference]]" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using [[reference work]]s, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc.  This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a "virtual" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations.

The terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pace |first=A. |title=Virtual Reference: What's in a Name? |journal=Computers in Libraries |date=April 2003 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is "virtual reference", with the secondary non-preferred term "digital reference" having gone out of use in recent years. "Chat reference" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, "synchronous virtual reference" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.&lt;ref name="Kern"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kern |first=M.K. |title=Virtual Reference Best Practices: Tailoring Services to Your Library |place=Chicago |publisher=ALA |year=2009}} {{ISBN|978-0-8389-0975-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by [[e-mail]]. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology.

With the advent of the graphical [[World Wide Web]], libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email.

In the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as "AskA" services. Examples of AskA services are the [[Internet Public Library]], [http://mathforum.org/dr.math/ Ask Dr. Math], and [http://americanart.si.edu/search/search_ajoa.cfm Ask Joan of Art].

Providing remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years.  For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries.&lt;ref name="Kern" /&gt; Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services.&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=G.G. |title=Librarianship: an introduction |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services.&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brophy |first=P. |title=The library in the twenty-first century |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current [[cyberculture]] and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the "Google Generation", of users who have grown up with the internet.&lt;ref name="Row"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rowlands |first=I. |title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future |journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=290–310 |year=2008 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1733495&amp;show=abstract |doi=10.1108/00012530810887953}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded [[Web 2.0]] (online social media such as [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[blogs]], [[del.icio.us]], [[Flickr]], etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services.&lt;ref name="Xiao"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xiao |first=N. |title=Web 2.0 as catalyst: Virtually reaching out to users and connecting them to library resources and services |journal=Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship |volume=55 |issue=Fall |year=2008 |url=http://www.istl.org/08-fall/article2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users.

The range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Marjorie E. "Cost Analysis of Library Reference Services," Advances in Library Administration and Organization, 11, 1993, pp. 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Lorraine, &amp; Pomerantz, Jeffrey. "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pla.0.0035 Virtual Reference, Real Money: Modeling Costs in Virtual Reference Services]," portal: Libraries and the Academy, 9, 2009, pp. 133-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of digital reference==

===Webforms===
Webforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question.  This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for.  Creation of webforms requires design consideration.  Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function.

Aspects commonly found within webforms:

*A return email address to send the answer to the question
*The question being asked
*The type of question
*What sources have been consulted by the patron
*How the patron is planning to use the information
*Location of the patron (are they a library patron?)
*A name to personalize the interaction
*A date by which the information is needed
*The type of sources being requested (print or electronic)&lt;ref&gt;Janes, Joseph. "Introduction to Reference Work in the Digital Age", pages 64-65. Neal-Schuman Publishers Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chat using commercial applications===
Several applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Some of these applications are: [http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint], [https://www.omnireference.com/ OmniReference], [http://tutor.com/ Tutor.com], [https://libraryh3lp.com/ LibraryH3lp], [http://aspiringkidz.com/ AspiringKidz.com], and [http://Vienova.com/ Vienova.com]. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk applications. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co-browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre-scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting.

===Chat using instant messaging===
{{See also|chatbot|virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)}}
[[Instant messaging]] (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free.  Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet.  This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian.  On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron.  IM reference services may be for the use of in-house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public.

Successful IM reference services will:
*Create a profile to convey information about the library and increase online presence.
*Accept imperfection in conversations without spending time to go back and make corrections.  Most words are recognizable through context.
*Become familiar with and use accepted IM abbreviations such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud).
*Don't panic.  While speed is important it is more important to not feel rushed.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rick. "IM Me", Library Journal 130 (April 1, 2005): 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Christina M. &amp; Graves, Stephanie J. "Instruction via Instant Messaging reference: what’s happening?", The Electronic Library 24 (2) ( 2006): 174-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software for providing digital reference==
The article [http://slj.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA251679 Live, Digital Reference Marketplace] by Buff Hirko contains a comparison of the features of applications for chat-based reference.

See the entries in the [http://www.libsuccess.org/index.php?title=Online_Reference Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section], including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference.

===Software features===
Virtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs.&lt;ref name="Bro" /&gt; However, each program may have several distinct features. A [[knowledge base]] is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of [[frequently asked questions]] (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure.

Online chat, or [[instant messaging]] (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature.  Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language.  Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff.

The use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years.  Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat.  In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response.

With the increase in use of text messaging ([[Short Message Service]] or SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. [[Librarian]]s can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging.

[[Co-browsing]], or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images.&lt;ref name="Hua"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hua |first=Z. |title="Chapter 2.10: A Cooperative Framework for Information Browsing in Mobile Environment".

(2008) Mobile Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications |place=London |publisher=Information Science Reference |pages=497–505 |year=2008 |url=http://www.igi-global.com/reference|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The UK==

Virtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"&gt;Barry, E et al (2010) Virtual Reference in UK academic libraries: The virtual enquiry project 2008–2009, Library Review, Vol. 59 (1) pp.40-55&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"/&gt;

UK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, S. (1998) Delivering the New Public Library: the role of the EARL Consortium, INFOCUS 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt; in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK-wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide),&lt;ref&gt;Berube, L. (2005) People's Network Enquire: virtual reference in England, World Library and Information Congress: 71st IFLA General Conference and Council, August 14th - 18th 2005, Oslo, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council),&lt;ref&gt;SLIC homepage: http://www.slainte.org.uk/slic/slicindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. It uses the [[Online Computer Library Center]]'s QuestionPoint software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Library Association's digital reference guidelines==
The definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components:

# "Virtual reference is reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet technology to communicate with reference staff, without being physically present. Communication channels used frequently in virtual reference include chat, videoconferencing, Voice over IP, co-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging.
# While online sources are often utilized in provision of virtual reference, use of electronic sources in seeking answers is not of itself virtual reference.
# Virtual reference queries are sometimes followed-up with telephone, fax, in-person and regular mail interactions, even though these modes of communication are not considered virtual."&lt;ref name="MARS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee |year=2004 |title=Guidelines for Implementing and Maintaining Virtual Reference Services |journal=Reference and User Services Quarterly |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/rusa/resources/guidelines/virtrefguidelines.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 [[QuestionPoint]] and the [[American Library Association]] were in talks about offering a National Ask A Librarian service across the whole United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;http://questionpoint.blogs.com/questionpoint_247_referen/2011/01/a-national-virtual-reference-service-for-the-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; At present the Ask services in the US are run at a local level.

==Other countries==
In Europe some countries offer services in both their own national language and in English. European countries include: Finland,&lt;ref&gt;Finnish National Libraries online reference service: http://www.libraries.fi/en-GB/ask/&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands (in Dutch only),&lt;ref&gt;The Netherlands online reference service: http://www2.bibliotheek.nl/home&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Danish Libraries homepage, with links to a virtual reference form: http://bibliotek.dk/?lingo=eng&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;Public library of Lyon, France: http://www.guichetdusavoir.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries which offer virtual reference services include: Australia,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.nla.gov.au/askalibrarian/&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of New Zealand's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.natlib.govt.nz/services/get-advice/ask-a-librarian&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Canada's virtual reference services: http://vrl.tpl.toronto.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Colorado in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Colorado, the service from the state of Colorado in the USA: {{cite web|url=http://www.askcolorado.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725045834/http://www.askcolorado.org/ |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chasing the Sun==

A collaboration between UK and Australian library services, entitled Chasing the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changechampions.com.au/resource/Sue_Rockliff.pdf PDF presentation by Chasing the Sun Co-chair Sue Rockliff]&lt;/ref&gt; has been initiated using [[QuestionPoint]] software so that an all-hours digital reference chat service can be offered.  Targeted at health libraries where reference queries from health professionals could occur at any time of the day or night due to medical emergencies, the collaboration between the two countries means that someone will be on hand to field the query at any time. Although the UK libraries involved are currently based in England the programme may expand to other countries and health services if successful.

A '''ditloid''' is a type of [[word puzzle]],&lt;ref name="Ditloids" /&gt; in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated.&lt;ref name="Ditloids"&gt;http://www.ditloids.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2013}} The name 'ditloid' was given by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref name=Ditloids /&gt; originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich|1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.

==History==
[[Will Shortz]] originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]], calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of "What's hot and what's not," [[Us Magazine|''Us'' magazine]] named the Equation Analysis Test in the "what's hot" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from ''Games'' (word for word, except for my byline),
photocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter,
and circulated around the country. ''Games'' readers who hadn't seen the original even started sending
it back to ''Games'' as something the magazine ought to consider publishing!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test - Revised Form published in [[Morgan Worthy]]'s 1975 book ''AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking'' (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy's equations were in a different format, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
!style="width:250px;text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Puzzle&lt;/u&gt;
!style="text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Solution&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|M. + M. + N.H. + V. + C. + R.I = N.E.
|[[Maine]] + [[Massachusetts]] + [[New Hampshire]] + [[Vermont]] + [[Connecticut]] + [[Rhode Island]] = [[New England]]
|-
|"1B. in the H. = 2 in the B."
|"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" (a [[proverb]])
|-
|N. + V. + P. + A. + A. + C. + P. + I. = P. of S.
|[[noun]] + [[verb]] + [[pronoun]] + [[adjective]] + [[adverb]] + [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] + [[preposition]]  + [[interjection]] = [[Parts of Speech]]
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Worthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity
of this puzzle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had
written in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the
University of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized
the format was a good one for eliciting the "aha effect". After that I
used such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on
creative thinking.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is
that the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in
an incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly
see an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral
rather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had
the answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously
thinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about
to fall asleep.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge
on obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, "I
could never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it."
There is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer
inside and just need to find it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

'''''Handbook of Middle American Indians''''' ('''HMAI''') is a sixteen-volume compendium on [[Mesoamerica]] , from the [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] to the late twentieth century. Volumes on particular topics were published from the 1960s and 1970s under the general editorship of [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wauchope, general editor. ‘’Handbook of Middle American Indians’’, 16 volumes.  Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt; Separate volumes with particular volume editors  deal with  a number of general topics, including archeology, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, linguistics, with the last four substantive volumes treating various topics in Mesoamerican ethnohistory, under the editorship of [[Howard F. Cline]]. Select volumes have become available in e-book format.

A retrospective review of the HMAI by two anthropologists discusses its history and evaluates it.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Marcus and Ronald Spores, "The Handbook of Middle American Indians: A Retrospective Look."

[[File:Chris Messina - South by Southwest 2010 (1).jpg|alt=Chris Messina proposed the use of hashtags in his famous 2007 tweet. |thumb|Chris Messina, the inventor of the hashtag. |440x440px]]A '''hashtag''' is a type of [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tag]] used on [[Social networking service|social networks]] such as [[Twitter]] and other [[microblogging]] services, allowing users to apply [[wikt:dynamic#Adjective|dynamic]], [[user-generated content|user-generated]] tagging which makes it possible for others to easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing the number sign or pound sign &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. The hashtag may contain letters, digits, and underscores.&lt;ref name="charset"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hashtags.org/featured/what-characters-can-a-hashtag-include/|title=What Characters Can A Hashtag Include?|author=|date=|website=hashtags.org|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searching for that hashtag will yield each message that has been tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsia-Ching|last2=Iyer|first2=Hemalata|title=Trends in Twitter - Hashtag Applications: Design Features for Value-Added Dimensions to Future Library Catalogues|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/485537|journal=Library Trends|volume=61|issue=1|pages=248–258|doi=10.1353/lib.2012.0024|issn=1559-0682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on the [[photo sharing|photo-sharing]] service [[Instagram]], the hashtag ''#bluesky'' allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag.  

The use of hashtags was first proposed by [[Chris Messina (open-source advocate)|Chris Messina]] in a 2007 tweet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412|title=🅲🅷🆁🅸🆂 🅼🅴🆂🆂🅸🅽🅰︎ on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, although initially decried by Twitter as a "thing for nerds"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/decade-ago-hashtag-reshaped-internet-180964605/|title=A Decade Ago, the Hashtag Reshaped the Internet|last=Panko|first=Ben|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eventually led to their use spreading like wild-fire through the platform.

So much so that Instagram had to officially place a "30 hashtags" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing their use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.instagram.com/351460621611097|title=How do I use hashtags? {{!}} Instagram Help Center|website=help.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a limit which [[Instagrammer|Instagrammers]] eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itchban.com/blog/2017/1/7/instagram-max-hashtags-how-to-post-up-to-60|title=Instagram Max Hashtags: How to post up to 60|work=itchban|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites|title=Website Ranking: Top Websites Rank In The World - SimilarWeb|website=www.similarweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is highly common with [[millennials]], [[Generation Z|Gen Z]], politicians, [[Influencer marketing|influencers]], and celebrities worldwide. Because of its widespread use, ''hashtag'' was added to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/13/hashtag_added_to_the_oed/|title='Hashtag' added to the OED – but # isn't a hash, pound, nor number sign|date=June 13, 2014|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2014-update/new-words-notes-june-2014/|title=New words notes June 2014|date=June 2014|work=Oxford English Dictionary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007085108/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2014-update/new-words-notes-june-2014/|archivedate=October 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''hashtag'' is also sometimes erroneously used to refer to the hash symbol itself when used in the context of a hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/389023#eid301493073|title=Oxford English Dictionary – Hash|date=June 2014|work=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal taxonomies can be developed from the folk taxonomy rendered [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] by the markup that hashtags provide; this process is called [[folksonomy]].
== Origin and use ==
The [[Number sign|US pound sign, number sign or hash symbol]] "#" is often used in [[information technology]] to highlight a special meaning. ("Pound sign" in the UK means "[[£]]"; "#" is called hash, gate, and occasionally [[octothorpe]].) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote ''immediate'' [[address mode]] in the assembly language of the [[PDP-11]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://programmer209.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/the-pdp-11-assembly-language/ |title=PDP-11 assembly language |publisher=Programmer209.wordpress.com |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] used ''#'' in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] for special keywords that had to be processed first by the [[C preprocessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The C Programming Language]]|authors=B.W. Kernighan &amp; d. Ritchie|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1978|pages=86 and 207|isbn=0-13-110163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 [[SGML]] standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals, --e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data.[[File:Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (14203190979).jpg|thumb|A sign suggesting the use of a #TimeToAct hashtag at a 2014 conference|alt=|440x440px]]

The International Telecommunication Union approved in November 1988 recommendation E.161 that put the hash sign on the right side of the 0 in the 4 x 3 button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the hash: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most hash signs in Europe now follow the 80-degree inclination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-E.161-198811-S!!PDF-E&amp;type=items |title=Recommendation E.161 - Arrangement of figures, letters and symbols on telephones and other devices that can be used for gaining access to a telephone network  |publisher=ITU |date=November 25, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pound sign was adopted for use within [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.&lt;ref&gt;"Channel Scope". Section 2.2. {{IETF RFC|2811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an [[ampersand]] '&amp;').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Internet Relay Chat Protocol |rfc=1459 |sectionname=Channels |section=1.3 |page= |last1=Oikarinen |first1=Jarkko |authorlink1=Jarkko Oikarinen |last2=Reed |first2=Darren |authorlink2= |year=1993 |month=May |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the pound sign in IRC inspired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/computing/2014/summer/originstory.shtml |title=#OriginStory|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|date=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Messina (open source advocate)|Chris Messina]] to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/fashion/hashtags-a-new-way-for-tweets-cultural-studies.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Twitter's Secret Handshake | work=The New York Times | date=June 10, 2011 | accessdate=July 26, 2011 | author=Parker, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted the first hashtag on Twitter:
{{quote |1=How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? |author = Chris Messina |source = ("factoryjoe"), August 23, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/factoryjoe/statuses/223115412|title = Twitter post|author = Chris Messina ("factoryjoe")|date = August 23, 2007&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 50% |align  = center }}
Messina’s suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the [[2007 California wildfires#San Diego County|2007 San Diego forest fires]] in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/ What is hashtag?"], Mashable, 8 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factoryjoe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factoryjoe.com/2007/10/22/twitter-hashtags-for-emergency-coordination-and-disaster-relief/|title=Twitter hashtags for emergency coordination and disaster relief|website=Factory Joe|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for "lay" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag "was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Kate|date=May 1, 2015|title=The pragmatics of hashtags: Inference and conversational style on Twitter|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821661500096X|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=81|pages=8–20|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2015.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details.

Internationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and [[Persian language|Persian]]-language hashtags in communications during the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The story of the hashtag began with Iranians|url=http://www.dw.de/حکایت-هشتگی-که-ایرانیان-آغاز-کردند/g-18012627|accessdate=March 12, 2015|publisher=Deutsche Welle Persian|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stoweboyd.com/post/39877198249/hash-tags-twitter-groupings |title=Stowe Boyd, Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings |publisher=Stoweboyd.com |date= |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer [[Ben Zimmer]], chair of the [[American Dialect Society]]'s New Words Committee.

Beginning July 2, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter Makes Hashtags More #Useful|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/twitter-makes-hashtags-more-useful/|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced "[[Twitter#Trending topics|Trending Topics]]" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to [[spamming|spam]] the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/the-secret-of-twitters-trending-hashtags-with-insight-and-tips/ |title=The Secret of Twitter's Trending Hashtags With Insight and Tips |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date= |accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/12/tech/social-media/facebook-hashtags/index.html|title=Facebook finally gets #hashtags - CNN.com|last=Mashable|first=By Christina Warren|website=CNN|access-date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
A hashtag must begin with a hash character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space, or end of message. It is always safe to precede the “#” with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores.{{r|charset}} In many cases other characters are also allowed, in particular accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another, and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&amp;Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&amp;, or #Romeo&amp;Juliet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |title=Hashtag Standards|website=Terence Eden's Blog|date=25 February 2010|author=Terence Eden|accessdate= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashtags are not case sensitive; a search for “#hashtag” will find “#HashTag”. The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases readability and avoids confusion; a (real) pen shop would be advised to use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penisland.net/ |title=Pen Island Pens - Home |website=Penisland.net |date=  |author= |accessdate= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g. “It is #sunny today”).

Languages which do not use letters are handled slightly differently. In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g. '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '我&amp;#8204;#爱&amp;#8204;你', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the "absolute maximum", and any contribution exceeding this risks "raising the ire of the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a (#) Hashtag?|url=http://www.hashtags.org/how-to/history/what-is-a-hashtag/|publisher=Hashtags.org|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation, could cause an account to be filtered from search, or suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Twitter Rules|url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/56-policies-violations/topics/236-twitter-rules-policies/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=September 22, 2017|quote=if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using # ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA |title="#Hashtag" with Jimmy Fallon &amp; Justin Timberlake (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon) |publisher=YouTube |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

[[File:Seguir hashtags.png|thumb|Search bar in the header of a social networking site, searching for most recent posts containing the hashtag #science|alt=|440x440px]]

Hashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can "trend" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the "Trending Topics" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be "retired" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.

Hashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become "trending topics" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.

Hashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and "follow" (subscribe) or "list" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.

Television broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.

Hashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Olszanowski, M. (2014). "Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83–95. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous Youtube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.

Hashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikström|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|publisher=|access-date=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. "My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with "It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, "BREAKING: US GDP growth is back! #kidding". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: "Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility," where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skase.sk/Volumes/JTL28/pdf_doc/05.pdf|title=The ‘hashtag’: A new word or a new rule?|last=Caleffi|first=Paola-Maria|date=|website=Skase Journal of Theoretical Linguistics|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
The feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on [[YouTube]] and [[Gawker Media]]. In the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments were used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees were not logged into the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gawker.com/5382267/anarchy-in-the-machine-welcome-to-gawkers-open-forums|title = Anarchy in the Machine: Welcome to Gawker's Open Forums|author = Gabriel Snyder|publisher = Gawker|date = October 15, 2009&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/10/got-a-tip-gawker-media-opens-tag-pages-to-masses-expecting-chaos/|title = Got a #tip?

Seward|publisher = Nieman Journalism Lab|date = October 15, 2009 &lt;!-- 8 a.m. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time search aggregators such as the former [[Google Real-Time Search]] also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the "river" of Twitter posts that can result from search terms or hashtags.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Uses ==

=== Broadcast media ===

The use of hashtags has extended to [[television]]{{nsmdns}}a concept that began rising in prominence in the early 2010s. Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;|author = Michael Schneider|publisher = TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or "branded" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as [[Ed Schultz|@edshow]]) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to "trend" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, "temporary" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|publisher = Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of trending "temporary" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called "Tonight Show Hashtags," which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the "Tonight Show Hashtags" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded "[[Index term|keywords]]" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords — But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled "Hashtag Wars," in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.

Some hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan "''[[Je suis Charlie]],''" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.

=== Purchasing ===

Since February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Event promotion ===

[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights|alt=|440x440px]]

Organized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.

Companies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.

Political protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] as the "#HELSINKI2018 Meeting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumer complaints ===
Hashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term "bashtag" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sentiment analysis ===
The use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest predictor of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets? Investigating the impact of sarcasm on sentiment analysis|journal=Proceedings of the Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a difficult [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] problem.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/power-yourself-with-viral-marketing-become-a-hashtag_us_57bf13e6e4b06384eb3e7f1d?dxrywr9zcw30rizfr|title=Power yourself with viral marketing - become a HashTag Genius &amp;#124; HuffPost|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
The YouTuber Spencer FC used the hashtag for the name and crest of his YouTube-based association football team, [[Hashtag United F.C.]].

Since the 2012–13 season, the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE. The tweets and Facebook posts must include #NBAVOTE along with the player's first and last name or Twitter handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/11/15/2014-nba-all-star-ballot-official-release/|title=NBA and Sprint tip off NBA All-Star Balloting 2014|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2011 Canadian leaders debates|April 2011 Canadian party leader debate]], [[Jack Layton]], then-leader of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], referred to [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s crime policies as "a hashtag fail" (presumably #fail).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jack-laytons-debatable-hashtag-fail/article576224/|title = Jack Layton's debatable 'hashtag' #fail|author = Anna Mehler Paperny|publisher = The Globe and Mail|date = April 13, 2011 &lt;!-- , 6:00 AM EDT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/04/13/cv-debate-twitter.html|title = Canadians atwitter throughout debate|date = April 13, 2011&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;|publisher = CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashtags have been used verbally to make a humorous point in informal conversations,&lt;ref name="macmillandictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/hashtag|title=hashtag (noun) definition and synonyms|website=Macmillan Dictionary|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "I’m hashtag confused!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In August 2012, British journalist Tom Meltzer reported in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about a new [[hand gesture]] that mimicked the hashtag, sometimes called the "finger hashtag", in which both hands form a [[Peace sign#The V sign|peace sign]], and then the fingers are crossed to form the symbol of a hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2012/aug/01/how-to-say-hashtag-fingers |title=How to say 'hashtag' with your fingers |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Tom Meltzer |date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging gesture was reported about in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' by [[Nimrod Kamer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/06/hashtags |title=Finger-Hashtags |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=[[Nimrod Kamer]] |date=March 2013 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during 2013, it was seen on TV as used by [[Jimmy Fallon]], and on ''[[The Colbert Report]],'' among other programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/lol/finger-hashtag-jimmy-fallon-twitter/ |title=I invented finger hashtags—and I regret nothing |work=[[The Daily Dot]] |author=[[Nimrod Kamer]] |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2015, Paola Maria Caleff considered this usage a [[fad]], but noted that people talking the way that they write was a consequence of computer-mediated communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Adaptations ===
*Hashflags: In 2010, Twitter introduced "hashflags" during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |title=Twitter Supports World Cup Fever with Hashflags |publisher=Ryanseacrest.com |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129201517/http://ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |archivedate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reintroduced the feature on June 10, 2014, in time for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howto.digidefen.se/twitter/What-are-hashflags.php |title=What are Hashflags? |publisher=Howto.digidefen.se |date=June 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Woods |url=https://thenextweb.com/twitter/2014/06/10/twitter-brings-back-hashflags-just-time-world-cup-2014-kick/ |title=Twitter brings back hashflags just in time for World Cup 2014 kick-off |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=June 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again on April 10, 2015, with UK political party logos for the 2015 UK General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter just launched election hashflags|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32249518/twitter-just-launched-election-hashflags|website=BBC News|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a user tweets a hashtag consisting of the three letter country code of any of the 32 countries represented in the tournament, Twitter automatically embeds a flag emoticon for that country. A similar system was implemented for the 2015 [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Twitter hashflags go live!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_twitter_hashflags_go_live|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cashtags: In 2009, [[StockTwits]] used [[ticker symbol]]s preceded by the [[dollar sign]] to create "cashtags".&lt;ref name=Wong2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wong, Matthew |title=VCs and Start-Ups Pin Their Hopes on Pinterest |date=August 17, 2012 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2012/08/17/vcs-and-start-ups-pin-their-hopes-on-pinterest/ |accessdate=May 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, Colleen |title=Howard Lindzon on Why He Sold His Twitter Stock, And The 'Hijack' Of StockTwits’ Cashtags [TCTV] |date=July 1, 2012 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/howard-lindzon-on-why-he-sold-his-twitter-stock-and-the-hijack-of-stocktwits-cashtags-tctv/ |accessdate=May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Twitter adapted the hashtag style to make company ticker symbols preceded by the dollar sign clickable (as in [[Apple, Inc.|$AAPL]]), a method that Twitter dubbed the "cashtag".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim |first=Erin |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/31/technology/twitter-cashtag/ |title=Twitter unveils 'cashtags' to track stock symbols – Jul. 31, 2012 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/30/3205284/twitter-stock-ticker-cashtag-links-official |title=Twitter makes stock symbol $ 'cashtag' links official, following # and @ |publisher=The Verge |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to allow users to search posts discussing companies and their stocks. This is also used for discussion of currency pairings on Twitter, e.g. using #USDGBP or $USDGBP,  when mentioning the US Dollar's level expressed in Pounds Sterling.

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.
:[3] Ibid., 29.
:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.
* In the 1989 book ''Pyramids'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], one of the Ephebian philosophers is called "Ibid".
* In the 1997 movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', the main character, Will Hunting, when arguing for himself in court against the dismissive rebuttals of the prosecuting attorney, cites obscure case law, then follows up by stating "Ibid, your Honour."

'''Indirect self-reference''' describes an object [[self-reference|referring to itself]] ''indirectly''.

For example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.

This example is similar to the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] expression "((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in [[lambda calculus]].

Indirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence "this sentence is false." The phrase "this sentence" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase "this sentence" with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun "this."

An example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the [[quine (computing)|quine]] of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:
 is a sentence fragment
would be:
 "is a sentence fragment" is a sentence fragment
which, incidentally, is a true statement.

Now consider the sentence:
 "when quined, makes quite a statement" when quined, makes quite a statement

The quotation here, plus the phrase "when quined," indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase "makes quite a statement," can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like "this sentence makes quite a statement."

It seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of [[mathematical logic]], there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example above uses a [[quine (computing)|quine]], and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.

Indirect self-reference was studied in great depth by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].  Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:

 "yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation" yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation

'''Informationsdienst Wissenschaft e.V.''' or idw (The Science Information Service) operates an Internet platform, which bundles the press reports and dates of important events from about 1,000 scientific institutions, including universities, technical colleges, governmental and non-governmental research institutes and institutes to support research or scientific administration. idw (a registered charitable society) also operates an expert broker, the idw expert finder, which is exclusively for journalists. This makes idw one of the most comprehensive sources of science news in the German-speaking area. Foreign journalists and institutions (mostly European) now use idw as well. 
[[Image: new idw-logo.png|thumb|Informationsdienst Wissenschaft e.v.]] 

The two main objectives of idw are:
* To provide the public with a comprehensive picture of science in the German-speaking area.
* To create a close network between the linked (research) institutions.

==Services==
The information in idw can be accessed free of charge - either directly on idw’s www pages, or by using an individually configurable RSS feed or as an e-mail subscriber. Any user can request the information covering the topics and regions which interest him. All idw services can be used free of cost - the current news ticker, the science calendar, research in the archive (which contains more than 350,000 press releases), and the list of institutions linked to idw. idw also provides journalists with instruments for contacting experts, and maintains a database with science photos.
The members' press offices have various possibilities of communicating with journalists. Membership is only offered to German or foreign institutions which perform research or teaching, or which support science or are active in science in some other way.

==Idea and Foundation==
The original idea of idw was to provide experts for journalists. Using the American ProfNet as example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heisser Draht zur Forschung |url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,140281,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=19 June 2001 |accessdate=17 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the press officers of [http://www.uni-bayreuth.de Universitaet Bayreuth], the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] and the Clausthal University of Technology, in collaboration with Computing Centre of Clausthal University of Technology/[http://www.tu-clausthal.de TU Clausthal], developed a concept for a German language network, by means of the new media. The concept was technically implemented by the staff of the Computing Centre of the Clausthal University of Technology. A total of nine staff members in Bayreuth, Bochum and Clausthal are responsible for programming, maintaining and developing the idw operating system, for user services and further development of the content.

==Financial Support and Development==
The initial phase (1996–1999) was guaranteed by project support from the Federal Ministry for Education and Research ([[BMBF]]). The technical development of the idw was supported by the Ministry, together with the [http://www.stifterverband.de Stifterverband fuer die Deutsche Wissenschaft] (Donor Association for German Science). idw has been working closely for years with the initiative [[Wissenschaft im Dialog]] (Science in Dialogue). idw has been economically independent since 2000 and is financed by contributions from member institutions. It has been organised as a registered charitable society (gemeinnütziger e. V.) since 2002.

==Significance and Scope==
idw has developed as a recognised and accepted source for German language science and for science journalism. It has become an instrument for public relations work for scientific institutions. 
About 37,000 subscribers (figure for June 2018&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idw-online.de/en/aboutus&lt;/ref&gt;) receive regular reports from idw, including some 7,900 journalists. About 1,000 institutions publish their press reports and dates of important events via idw.

'''Leslie Gilbert Pine''' (22 December 1907 – 15 May 1987) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], [[lecturer]], and researcher in the areas of [[genealogy]], [[nobility]], history, [[heraldry]] and [[animal welfare]].{{ref|ancestry3}}  He was born in 1907 in [[Bristol]], [[England]] and died in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]] in 1987.  He was the son of Lilian Grace Beswetherick and Henry Moorshead Pine (a tea merchant).{{ref|ancestry1}}

From 1935 to 1940 he served as an assistant [[editing|editor]] at [[Burke's Peerage]] Ltd. During [[World War II]] he was an officer in the [[Royal Air Force]] intelligence branch, serving in [[North Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[India]]; he retired with the rank of Squadron Leader. After the war and until 1960, he was Burke's executive director. Pine edited ''Burke's Peerage,'' 1949-1959; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Great Britain),'' 1952; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Ireland),'' 1958; and, ''Burke's Distinguished Families of America,'' 1939, 1947.  He also edited ''The International Year Book and Statesmen's Who's Who,'' 1953-1960; ''Author's and Writer's Who's Who,'' 1948, 1960; ''Who's Who in Music,'' 1949; and, ''Who's Who in the Free Churches,'' 1951.{{ref|pine1}}

A graduate of London University, he became a Barrister-at-Law, Inner Temple, in 1953. Pine was a member of the International Institute of Genealogy and Heraldry, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, a Fellow of the Ancient Monuments Society, a Life Fellow of the Institute of Journalists, a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], and a Liveryman of the Glaziers' Company.  In [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] he was the unsuccessful [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Bristol Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol Central]].

He was managing editor of a British hunting magazine, ''[[Shooting Times]]'', from 1960 to 1964.{{ref|Times1}} He later authored an important book highly critical of [[sport hunting]], ''After Their Blood'', in which he wrote: "It is our duty as men and women of God’s redeemed creation to try not to increase the suffering of the world, but to lessen it. To get rid of bloodsports will be a great step toward this end."

In 1948 Leslie Pine married Grace V. Griffin (20 August 1914- ). Their only child, [[Richard Pine]], was born in London on 21 August 1949.

[[File:Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng page.png|thumb|upright|A page from the ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever printed]]

The '''''leishu''''' ({{zh|t=類書|l=category books}}) is a genre of [[Reference work|reference books]] historically compiled in China and other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]]. The term is generally translated as "encyclopedia", although the ''leishu'' are quite different from the modern notion of [[encyclopedia]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

== Overview ==

The ''leishu'' are composed of sometimes lengthy citations from other works,{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} and often contain copies of entire works, not just excerpts.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The works are classified by a systematic set of categories, which are further divided into subcategories.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} ''Leishu'' may be considered [[anthologies]], but are encyclopedic in the sense that they may comprise the entire realm of knowledge at the time of compilation.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}}

Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled from the early third century until the eighteenth century, of which 200 have survived.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=603}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled was the 1408 ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', containing 370 million [[Chinese characters]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} and the largest ever printed was the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

==History==
[[File:Yongle Dadian Encyclopedia 1403.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled]]

The genre first appeared in the early third century. The earliest known was the ''[[Huanglan]]'' ("Emperor's mirror"{{efn|Compare the later "[[speculum literature]]" in the Western tradition.}}). Sponsored by the emperor of [[Cao Wei]], it was compiled around 220, but has since [[Lost works|been lost]].{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} However, the term ''leishu'' was not used until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

In later imperial China dynasties, such as the [[Ming]] and [[Qing]], emperors sponsored monumental projects to compile all known human knowledge into a single ''leishu'', in which entire works, rather than excerpts, were copied and classified by category.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled, on the order of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of Ming, was the ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'' containing a total of 370 million [[Chinese characters]]. The project involved 2,169 scholars, who worked for four years under general editor [[Yao Guangxiao]]. It was completed in 1408, but never printed, as the imperial treasury had run out of money.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}}

The ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (Imperially approved synthesis of books and illustrations past and present) is by far the largest ''leishu'' ever printed, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}} It was compiled by a team of scholars led by [[Chen Menglei]], and printed between 1726 and 1728, during the Qing dynasty.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

The ''riyong leishu'' (encyclopedias for daily use), containing practical information for people who were literate but below the [[Confucian]] elite, were also compiled in the later imperial era. Today, they provide scholars with valuable information on non-elite culture and attitudes.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

According to [[Jean-Pierre Diény]], the [[Jiaqing Emperor|Jiaqing reign]] (1796–1820) of the Qing dynasty saw the end of the publication of ''leishu''.{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==In other countries==
[[File:Sancai Tuhui World Map.jpg|thumb|The world map entitled [[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]], from the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', an illustrated ''leishu'']]

Other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]] also adopted the genre of ''leishu''. In 1712, the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', a richly illustrated ''leishu'' compiled by Ming scholar Wang Qi (王圻) in the early 17th century, was printed in Japan as ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]''. The Japanese version was edited by Terajima Ryōan (寺島良安), a physician born in [[Osaka]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==Importance==
The ''leishu'' have played an important role in the preservation of ancient works, many of which have been lost, only preserved completely or partially as part of a ''leishu'' compilation. The 7th-century ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' is especially valuable. It contains excerpts from 1,400 pre-7th century works, 90% of which have been otherwise lost. Even though the ''Yongle Dadian'' is itself largely lost, the remnants still contain 385 complete books that have been otherwise lost.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}} The ''leishu'' also provide a unique view of the transmission of knowledge and education, and an easy way to locate traditional materials on any given subject.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

==Major compilations==
Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled, from the Cao Wei period (early third century) until the 18th century, of which 200 have survived. Among the most important, in chronological order, are:{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=603–5}}

*''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' (Collection of literature arranged by categories), compiled by [[Ouyang Xun]]
*''[[Beitang Shuchao]]'' (Excerpts from books in the Northern Hall), compiled by [[Yu Shinan]] ca. 630
*''[[Chuxue Ji]]'' (Writings for elementary instruction), compiled by Xu Jian et al. between 713 and 742
*''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' (''Taiping Imperial Reader''), compiled by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] et al., published 984
*''[[Cefu Yuangui]]'' (Outstanding models from the storehouse of literature), compiled by [[Wang Qinruo]] et al., completed in 1013
*''[[Yuhai]]'' (Ocean of jade), compiled by [[Wang Yinglin]] 1330–40
*''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', completed 1408, the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled
*''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', 1726–28, the largest ''leishu'' ever printed

{{Punctuation marks|※|caption=reference mark}}

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.
* To attribute a quote or viewpoint.
* As an alternative to parenthetical references; it is a simpler way to acknowledge information gained from another source.
* To escape the limitations imposed on the [[word count]] of various academic and legal texts which do not take into account notes. Aggressive use of this strategy can lead to a text affected by "foot and note disease" (a derogation coined by [[John Betjeman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Timothy|title=Rupert Brooke: Man and Monument|journal=English|year=1968|volume=17|issue=99|pages=79–84|url=http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/99/79.full.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2011|doi=10.1093/english/17.99.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

''The Independent'', Thursday 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125141230/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb The Cobweb]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 26 January 2015 issue. Retrieved 25 January 2015. Archived from [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb the original].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.
*[[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' uses footnotes to insert comical remarks and explanations by one of the protagonists, Bartimaeus.
*[[Michael Gerber (parodist)|Michael Gerber]]'s ''[[Barry Trotter]]'' parody series used footnotes to expand [[one-line joke]]s in the text into paragraph-long comedic monologues that would otherwise break the flow of the narrative.
*[[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]'' uses footnotes in which he says: "[They] can allow you to create a kind of secret second narrative, which is important if, say, you're writing a book about what a story is and whether stories are significant."{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Dr Carol Bolton uses extensive footnotes to provide the modern reader with a cipher for a novel about the travels of the fictional Spanish traveller [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275996974_Through_Spanish_Eyes_Robert_Southey's_Double_Vision_in_Letters_from_England_By_Don_Manuel_Alvarez_Espriella_%281807%29 Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella], an early 19th-century construct of Robert Southey's, designed to provide him with vehicle to critique the societal habits of the day.
*[[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series exploits the use of footnotes as a communication device (the ''footnoterphone'') which allows communication between the main character’s universe and the fictional bookworld.
*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration. As the editor of his father's autobiography, the narrator's son must correct any of his father's misstated facts. The frequency of these corrections increases as the father falls victim to both hubris and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. While most of these changes are minor, a few are essential to plot and character development.
*In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the main plot is told through the annotative endnotes of a fictional editor.
*''[[Bartleby y Compañía]],'' a novel by [[Enrique Vila-Matas]], is stylized as footnotes to a nonexistent novel.
*The works of [[Jack Vance]] often have footnotes, detailing and informing the reader of the background of the world in the novel.
*[[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' uses both footnotes and margin notes to offer additional commentary and humor.
*[[Doug Dorst]]'s novel ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' uses footnotes to explore the story and relationship of characters V.M. Straka and F.X. Caldeira.

'''''The Observer's Books''''' were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items.&lt;ref name=OPSCS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the books|url=http://www.observersbooksociety.co.uk/about_books.html|publisher=OPSCS|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Barry|title=To Have Borne Witness: Memories and Observations Regarding Human Population and Species Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-0310-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.  

The books were produced with paper [[dust jacket|dust covers]] up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as "Glossies". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.

The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.

In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on "airplanes" {{sic}}. This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. 

The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like ''Aircraft'', ''Automobiles'' and ''Railway Locomotives'' proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. 

When Warne was acquired by [[Penguin Books|Penguin books]] in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).

After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled ''Observer's Book of Observer's Books'' in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of ''Wayside and Woodland'' in 2003.

[[File:Pompeii-couple.jpg|thumb|right|This wall painting found in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]] is an example of a primary source about people in Pompeii in Roman times. ([[Portrait of Paquius Proculo]])]]

In the study of [[history]] as an academic discipline, a '''primary source''' (also called an '''original source''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], document, diary, [[manuscript]], [[autobiography]], recording, or any other source of [[information]] that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in [[library science]], and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In [[journalism]], a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalism: Primary Sources|url=http://infoguides.pepperdine.edu/c.php?g=287355&amp;p=1915752|publisher=Pepperdine University|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources are distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726061349/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland. &lt;/ref&gt; A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. "Primary" and "secondary" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;{{rp|118–246}}&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 |quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one. Since a source is only a source in a specific historical context, the same source object can be both a primary or secondary source according to what it is used for.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of source classification==

===History===

[[File:donfelipe.jpg|thumb|360px|right|From a letter of Philip II, King of Spain, 16th century]]
In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Between Two Cultures:An Introduction to Economic History|page=27|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co.|year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sreedharan believes that primary sources have the most direct connection to the past and that they "speak for themselves" in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sreedharan|first=E.|title=A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000|year=2004|publisher=Orient Longman|isbn=81-250-2657-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIGq85RVvdoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=302|quote=[I]t is through the primary sources that the past indisputably imposes its reality on the historian. That this imposition is basic in any understanding of the past is clear from the rules that documents should not be altered, or that any material damaging to a historian's argument or purpose should not be left out or suppressed. These rules mean that the sources or the texts of the past have an integrity and that they do indeed 'speak for themselves', and that they are necessary constraints through which past reality imposes itself on the historian.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Though the terms ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' originated in [[historiography]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In [[scientific literature]], a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In [[political history]], primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the [[history of ideas]] or [[intellectual history]], the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In [[religious history]], the primary sources are [[religious texts]] and descriptions of religious [[ceremonies]] and [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/content.php?pid=60919&amp;sid=447878|title=Primary Sources - Religion|website=Research Guides at Tufts University|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[cultural history]] could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Howell | first1 = Martha C. | last2 = Prevenier | first2 = Walter. | title = From reliable sources : an introduction to historical method | year = 2001 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn = 0-8014-8560-6 | pages =20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Narrative]] sources''' or '''literary sources''' tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include [[diary|diaries]], films, biographies, leading philosophical works and [[scientific works]].
*'''Diplomatic sources''' include [[charter]]s and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
*'''Social documents''' are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cripps |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Historical Truth: An Interview with Ken Burns |journal=American Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=741–764 |doi=10.2307/2168603 |jstor= 2168603|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 100, No. 3 |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.&lt;br&gt;
*In the [[humanities]], a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
*In the [[social sciences]], the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
*In the [[natural sciences]], a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions "Primary Sources: what are they?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208191118/http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions |date=8 February 2009 }}. Lafayette College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in [[archives]], [[libraries]], [[museum]]s, [[historical societies]], and [[special collections]]. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the [[Huntington Library]] in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The [[Library of Congress]] maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are [http://www.memory.loc.gov American Memory] and [[Chronicling America]]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also has digital collections in [http://digitalvaults.org/ Digital Vaults]. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The [[Internet Archive]] also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, [[Europeana]] has digitized materials from across Europe while the [[World Digital Library]] and [[Flickr Commons]] have items from all over the world. [[Trove]] has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or [[finding aid]]. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as [[WorldCat]], the [https://catalog2.loc.gov/ Library of Congress catalog], the [https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/ National Archives catalog], and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. [[Arthur Marwick]] says "Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history."&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;Marwick, Arthur. "Primary Sources: Handle with Care". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-46580-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be [[memoir]]s, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in [[classical studies]], where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. "Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret."&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

The following questions are asked about primary sources:
* What is the tone?
* Who is the intended audience?
* What is the purpose of the publication?
* What assumptions does the author make?
* What are the bases of the author's conclusions?
* Does the author agree or disagree with other authors of the subject?
* Does the content agree with what you know or have learned about the issue?
* Where was the source made? (questions of [[systemic bias]])

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla/&gt; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Taking Stock of Research Methods and Analysis on Oppositional Political Terrorism|journal=The American Sociologist|volume=35|issue=2|year=2004|pages=26–37|doi=10.1007/BF02692395|quote=The analysis of secondary source information is problematic. The further an investigator is from the primary source, the more distorted the information may be. Again, each new person may put his or her spin on the findings.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text="A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than primary sources or secondary sources actually based on primary sources, is by definition [[fiction]] and not history at all."|sign=Kameron Searle|}}

However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be [[bias]] and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.
{{quote|"Original material may be... prejudiced, or at least not exactly what it claims to be."|David Iredale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Iredale | first1 = David | title = Enjoying archives: what they are, where to find them, how to use them | year = 1973 | publisher = Newton Abbot, David and Charles, | isbn = 0-7153-5669-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to [[peer review]], can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectiveness]] of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a [[Diary|journal]] entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's [[opinion]] on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and [[witness|eyewitness]]es may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, ''The Oral History Manual'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, " Analysis of Primary Sources" [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/psources/analyze.html online 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be [[censorship|censored]] or altered for propaganda or [[cover-up]] purposes. The facts can be [[distortion|distorted]] to present the opposing sides in a negative light. [[Barrister]]s are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton| first1=Margaret Stieg|last2=Charnigo|first2=Laurie|title=Historians and Their Information Sources|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|page=419| doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.400|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/400.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 January 2017}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delgadillo|first1=Roberto|last2=Lynch|first2=Beverly|title=Future Historians: Their Quest for Information|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/60/3/245.full.pdf+html|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=May 1999|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=245–259, at 253|quote=[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing.|ref=harv}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary&lt;ref name=Duffin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name=Duffin/&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|title=Primary Source by Primary Source?

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called [[diplomatics]].

For centuries, [[Pope]]s used the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false [[Anglo-Saxon charters]], a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]], who placed false [[monumental brass]]es in a [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] "authenticated" the [[Hitler Diaries]], which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|UK National Archives]] in the hope of establishing a false [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to record class R4|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leppard| first=David|title=Forgeries revealed in the National Archives – Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3867853.ece|work=The Sunday Times|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.&lt;ref name=Handlin&gt;[[Oscar Handlin]] and [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–25}}

'''Recursion''' occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from [[linguistics]] to [[logic]]. The most common application of recursion is in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], where a [[function (mathematics)|function]] being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

==Formal definitions==
[[File:Serpiente alquimica.jpg|thumb|[[Ouroboros]], an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:
# {{anchor|base case}}A simple '''base case''' (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
# A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case

For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:
*One's [[parent]]s are one's [[ancestor]]s (''base case'').
*The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (''recursion step'').

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a classic example of recursion:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(0)=0\text{ as base case 1,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(1)=1\text{ as base case 2,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{For all integers }n&gt;1,~\text{ Fib}(n):=\text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the [[natural number]]s by the [[Peano axioms]] can be described as: ''0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.'' By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.

Recursively defined mathematical objects include [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and especially [[fractal]]s.

There are various more tongue-in-cheek "definitions" of recursion; see [[#Recursive humor|recursive humor]].

==Informal definition==
[[File:Sourdough.jpg|thumb|Recently refreshed [[sourdough]], bubbling through [[fermentation]]: the [[recipe]] calls for some sourdough left over from the last time the same recipe was made.]]

Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves  invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.

To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.  An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.

Recursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a [[sourdough]] recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a [[maze]]. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.

==In language==
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Language Instinct|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.08.004 | title = The faculty of language: What's so special about it? | year = 2005 | last1 = Pinker | first1=Steven | last2 = Jackendoff | first2=Ray | journal = Cognition | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–236 | pmid=15694646| citeseerx = 10.1.1.116.7784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: ''Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous'', in which the sentence ''witches are dangerous'' occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.

This provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: ''Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...''. There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.

Recently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by [[Daniel Everett]] on the basis of his claims about the [[Pirahã language]]. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0140 |title=Evidence and argumentation: A reply to Everett (2009) |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |year=2009 |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |last2=Pesetsky |first2=David |last3=Rodrigues |first3=Cilene |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=671–681 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106154616/http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary [[self-reference]] can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker|first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in [[natural language semantics]]. The word ''and'', for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, ''and'' is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. 1983. In Rainer Bäuerle et al., ''Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language''. Reprinted in Paul Portner and Barbara Partee, eds. 2002. ''Formal Semantics: The Essential Readings''. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[recursive grammar]] is a formal grammar that contains recursive [[production (computer science)|production rules]].&lt;ref name="ns02"&gt;{{citation

===Recursive humor===
Recursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a [[circular definition]] or [[self-reference]], in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an [[infinite regress]]. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their [[glossary]] along the lines of:
:Recursion, ''see Recursion''.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=David|title=Essentials of Discrete Mathematics|year=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|pages=494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuwhTxCVovQC&amp;dq=recursion+joke&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation is found on page 269 in the [[Back-of-the-book index|index]]  of some editions of [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]]'s book ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''; the index entry recursively references itself ("recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269"). The earliest version of this joke was in "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of ''The C Programming Language''.

Another joke is that "To understand recursion, you must understand recursion."&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; In the English-language version of the [[Google]] web search engine, when a search for "recursion" is made, the site suggests "Did you mean: ''recursion''." An alternative form is the following, from [[Andrew Plotkin]]: ''"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [[Douglas Hofstadter]] than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is."''

[[Recursive acronym]]s can also be examples of recursive humor. [[PHP]], for example, stands for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor", [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator." and [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's not Unix".

==In mathematics==
[[File:Sierpinski triangle.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Sierpinski triangle]]—a confined recursion of triangles that form a [[fractal]]]]

===Recursively defined sets===
{{Main|Recursive definition}}

====Example: the natural numbers====
{{see also|Closure (mathematics)}}
The canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the [[natural numbers]]:

:0 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''n'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''n'' + 1 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:The set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.

====Example: The set of true reachable propositions====
Another interesting example is the set of all "true reachable" propositions in an [[axiomatic system]].

*If a proposition is an axiom, it is a true reachable proposition.
*If a proposition can be obtained from true reachable propositions by means of inference rules, it is a true reachable proposition.
*The set of true reachable propositions is the smallest set of propositions satisfying these conditions.

This set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===Finite subdivision rules===
{{Main|Finite subdivision rule}}
Finite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create [[fractal]]-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the [[Cantor set]] is a subdivision rule, as is [[barycentric subdivision]].

===Functional recursion===
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] may be partly defined in terms of itself.  A familiar example is the [[Fibonacci number]] sequence: ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' − 1) + ''F''(''n'' − 2).  For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case ''F''(0) = 0 and ''F''(1) = 1.

A famous recursive function is the [[Ackermann function]], which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.

===Proofs involving recursive definitions===
Applying the standard technique of [[proof by cases]] to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields [[structural induction]], a powerful generalization of [[mathematical induction]] widely used to derive proofs in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]].

===Recursive optimization===
[[Dynamic programming]] is an approach to [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the [[Bellman equation]], which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).

===The recursion theorem===
In [[set theory]], this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist.  Given a set ''X'', an element ''a'' of ''X'' and a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem states that there is a unique function &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
for any natural number ''n''.

====Proof of uniqueness====
Take two functions &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;G: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  such that:

:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(n + 1) = f(G(n))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is an element of ''X''.

It can be proved by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'':

:'''Base Case''': &lt;math&gt;F(0) = a = G(0)&lt;/math&gt; so the equality holds for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Inductive Step''': Suppose &lt;math&gt;F(k) = G(k)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(k+1) = f(F(k)) = f(G(k)) = G(k+1).&lt;/math&gt;
::Hence F(k) = G(k) implies F(k+1) = G(k+1).

By induction, &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In computer science==
{{Main|Recursion (computer science)}}
A common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a [[computer programming]] technique, this is called [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is [[dynamic programming]]. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.

A classic example of recursion is the definition of the [[factorial]] function, given here in [[C (programming language)|C]] code:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

If not having reached the [[base case (recursion)|base case]] and returning with value {{math|1,}} every [[Instance (computer science)|instantiation]] of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by {{math|1}} ({{code|(n - 1)}}), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of {{code|n}}, analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.

Recursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in [[parser]]s for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.

[[Recurrence relation]]s are equations to define one or more sequences  recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be "solved" to obtain a non-recursive definition.

Use of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is usually simplicity.  The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.

The Russian Doll or [[Matryoshka doll|Matryoshka Doll]] is a physical artistic example of the recursive concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tang |first1=Daisy |title=Recursion |url=http://www.cpp.edu/~ftang/courses/CS240/lectures/recursion.htm |accessdate=24 September 2015 |quote=More examples of recursion: Russian Matryoshka dolls. Each doll is made of solid wood or is hollow and contains another Matryoshka doll inside it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recursion has been used in paintings since [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', made in 1320. Its central panel  contains the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych itself as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reference''' is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to ''refer to'' the second object. It is called a ''[[name]]'' for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the first object. A name is usually a [[phrase]] or expression, or some other [[Symbol|symbolic representation]]. Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.

References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] ([[onomatopoeia]]), [[visual perception|visual]] (text), [[olfaction|olfactory]], or tactile, [[emotions|emotional state]], relationship with other,&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, Brian, ''Aspects of alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the contemporary debate'', Fordham University Press, 2006, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; [[spacetime]] coordinate, [[symbolic system|symbolic]] or [[alpha-numeric grid|alpha-numeric]], a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in [[cryptography]].

References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below.

==Etymology and meanings==
The word ''reference'' is derived from [[Middle English]] ''referren'', from [[Middle French]] ''référer'', from [[Latin]] ''referre'', "to carry back", formed from the [[prefix]] ''re''- and ''ferre'', "to bear".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, 1969, p.1317&lt;/ref&gt; A number of words derive from the same root, including ''refer'', ''[[referee]]'', ''referential'', ''[[referent]]'', ''[[referendum]]''.

The verb ''refer (to)'' and its derivatives may carry the sense of "link to" or "connect to", as in the meanings of ''reference'' described in this article. Another sense is "consult"; this is reflected in such expressions as [[reference work]], [[reference desk]], [[job reference]], etc.

== Semantics ==
{{further|Sense and reference|Theory of reference}}
[[File:Ogden semiotic triangle.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[triangle of reference]], from the influential book ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]].]]
In [[semantics]], reference is generally construed as the relationships between [[noun]]s or [[pronoun]]s and objects that are named by them. Hence, the [[word]] "John" refers to the person John. The word "it" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Semantics|first = John | last = Saeed|page = 12|publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-22693-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the word-object relation is called "[[denotation]]"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called "[[exemplification]]"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the "[[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]".

===Meaning===
[[Gottlob Frege]] argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]: "[[Hesperus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and "[[Phosphorus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to [[Venus]], but the astronomical fact that '"Hesperus" is "Phosphorus"' can still be informative, even if the "meanings" of "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the [[sense and reference]] of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of [[secondary reference]] may be necessary to fill the gap. See also [[Opaque context]].

===Linguistic sign===
The very concept of the [[linguistic sign]] is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought.
Certain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] such as [[pronoun]]s. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence.  These could be the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] (actor) and patient (acted on), as in "The man washed himself", the theme and recipient, as in "I showed Mary to herself", or various other possible combinations.

==Computer science==
{{Main|Reference (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], [[Reference (computer science)|reference]]s are [[data type]]s that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of [[data structure]]s, such as [[linked list]]s. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most [[programming language]]s support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the [[C++]] language, see [[reference (C++)]].

The notion of reference is also important in relational [[database theory]]; see [[referential integrity]].

==Library and information sciences==
{{see also|Reference work|Reference desk}}

References to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] and for journal articles, the [[Digital object identifier|Digital object identifier (DOI)]] is gaining relevance. Information on the [[Internet]] may be referred to by a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]].

==Psychology==
In terms of mental processing, a [[self-reference]] is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Eric, ''Lex Naturalis, Ius Naturalis: Law as Positive Reasoning &amp; Natural Rationality'', The Rlias Clark Group, Melbourne, 2010, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that "All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, William, ''Behavior: The Control of Perception'', 2nd ed., Benchmark Publications, New Canaan, Connecticut, 2005, pp.47 &amp; 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
In academics and scholarship, an author-title-date information in [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] and [[footnote]]s, specifying complete works of other people. Copying of material by another author without proper citation or without required permissions is [[plagiarism]].

Keeping a [[diary]] allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between ''different'' people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of reference has been developing since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;
Reimer, Marga (2009). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference Reference]". ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarship, a reference may be a [[citation]] of a text that has been used in the creation of a piece of work such as an essay, report, or oration. Its primary purpose is to allow people who read such work to examine the author's sources, either for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of an article or book in a section marked "[[Bibliography]]" or "References". A bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. A reference section contains only those works cited by the author(s) in the main text.

==Law==
In [[patent]] law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed [[invention]] [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] or [[Novelty (patent)#United States|anticipated]]. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible.

==Arts==
In [[art]], a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include:
* an existing artwork,
* a reproduction (i.e., photo),
* directly observed object (i.e., person), or
* the artist's memory.
Another example of reference is [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.

A '''reference scenario''' is an imagined situation where a [[library]] patron brings a question to a [[librarian]] and there is then a conversation, called in the field a [[reference interview]], where the librarian works to help the patron find what he or she wants.  These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons.  Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.

A great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions.  This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions.  Scenarios are something different.  They focus the student on the interaction with patrons.  In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.

Scenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start.  Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer.  Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand.  Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide.  This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?

'''SDS-PAGE''' ('''sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis''') is a variant of [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], an analytical method in biochemistry for the separation of charged molecules in mixtures by their [[molecular mass]]es in an [[electric field]]. It uses [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate [[protein]] molecules.

SDS-PAGE is a [[Discontinuous electrophoresis|discontinuous electrophoretic system]] developed by [[Ulrich K.

[[File:Protein-SDS interaction.png|thumb|Unfolding of a protein with SDS]]
[[File:Process of Denaturation.svg|thumb|Unfolding of a protein with heat]]
SDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS ([[sodium dodecyl sulfate]]) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein,&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reynolds JA, [[Charles Tanford]] | title=Binding of dodecyl sulfate to proteins at high binding ratios.

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.

SDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules ([[monomer]]) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules.&lt;ref name="TurroYekta1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turro|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Yekta|first2=Ahmad|title=Luminescent probes for detergent solutions.

Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent [[cross-link]]ing and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the [[chemical equilibrium]] of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against [[protease]]s and an increased [[biological half-life]].&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Manning M, Colón W| title=Structural basis of protein kinetic stability: resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests a central role for rigidity and a bias toward beta-sheet structure. | journal=Biochemistry | year= 2004 | volume= 43 | issue= 35 | pages= 11248–54 | pmid=15366934 | doi=10.1021/bi0491898 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15366934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or [[western blot]]ting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.

=== Gel production ===
[[File:Electrophoresis gel combs 2.jpg|thumb|Sample combs with different numbers of pockets, each prong leaves a pocket in the gel when pulled out]]
[[File:Acrylamidgel.JPG|thumb|Polymerised separating and stacking gel before removing the sample comb (white) between the spacers (black), in the stacking gel are small amounts of bromophenol blue for improved visibility, the separating gel is unstained]]
When using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the [[diffusion]] does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.

By using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Margolis J, Kenrick KG| title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056–7 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=5774398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris–glycine and neutral pH Bis–Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237–245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiltfangArold1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352–366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer ([[continuous gel electrophoresis]]) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt; Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes.&lt;ref name="MoebiusDenker2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moebius|first1=Jan|last2=Denker|first2=Katrin|last3=Sickmann|first3=Albert|title=Ruthenium (II) tris-bathophenanthroline disulfonate is well suitable for Tris-Glycine PAGE but not for Bis-Tris gels|journal=Proteomics|volume=7|issue=4|year=2007|pages=524–527|issn=1615-9853|doi=10.1002/pmic.200600642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using [[MES (buffer)|MES]] or [[MOPS]] in the running buffer.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt;

=== Sample preparation ===
[[File:Disulfide reduction by DTT-2.png|thumb|Disulfide reduction by DTT]]
During sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95&amp;nbsp;°C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing [[thiol]]s such as [[β-mercaptoethanol]] (β-ME, 5% by volume), [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT, 10 millimolar) or [[dithioerythritol]] (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.

In addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian M. Rosenberg|title=Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gi-UgCF8G6EC&amp;pg=PA103|date=22 December 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4412-3|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.

=== Electrophoresis ===
[[File:Gelelektrophoreseapparatur.jpg|thumb|Electrophoresis chamber after a few minutes of electrophoresis. In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]
For separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.

The fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.

The most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.&lt;ref name="Schäggervon Jagow1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schägger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368–379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Protein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. [[Glycoprotein]]s have differential levels of [[glycosylations]] and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands.&lt;ref name="Cryo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryo-EM Part A: Sample Preparation and Data Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1mPepNTgxcC&amp;pg=PA28|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-095695-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Membrane protein]]s, because of their [[transmembrane domain]], are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower [[solubility]] in aqueous solutions, tend to bind [[lipid]]s, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to [[hydrophobic effect]]s when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in "tailing" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color ("smear") below a band.&lt;ref name="BurgessDeutscher2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P. Deutscher|title=Guide to Protein Purification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6Lp4yna4hoC&amp;pg=PA184|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092317-8|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a [[gel extraction]] can be performed.

=== Archiving ===
[[File:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|Two SDS gels after completed separation of the samples and staining in a drying frame]]
After protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Molecular mass determination ==

The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility.

== Applications ==
The SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.

Additionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).

In [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].

In medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].

== Variants ==
SDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].

While being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].&lt;ref name="Janson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]&lt;ref name="Desai2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed A. Desai|title=Downstream Processing of Proteins: Methods and Protocols|url=|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-027-8|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[ultrafiltration]].&lt;ref name="Raja2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghosh Raja|title=Protein Bioseparation Using Ultrafiltration: Theory, Applications And New Developments|url=|date=11 June 2003|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-78326-126-0|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a [[pull-down assay]]. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of [[Extraction (chemistry)|extractions]] and [[precipitation]]s using [[kosmotropic]] molecules, for example the [[ammonium sulfate precipitation]] and the [[polyethyleneglycol]] precipitation.

== History ==
In 1948, [[Arne Tiselius]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field.&lt;ref name="Pederson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pederson|first1=T.|title=Turning a PAGE: the overnight sensation of SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis|journal=The FASEB Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2007|pages=949–953|issn=0892-6638|doi=10.1096/fj.08-0402ufm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a [[zone electrophoresis]] improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, L., Davis, B. J.: ''Disc Electrophoresis –1. Background and Theory.'' In: ''Ann NY Acad Sci.'' 121, 1964, pp. 321–349.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by [[David F. Summers]] in the working group of [[James E. Darnell]] to separate poliovirus proteins.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Summers DF, Maizel JV, Darnell JE| title=Evidence for virus-specific noncapsid proteins in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 1965 | volume= 54 | issue= 2 | pages= 505–13 | pmid=4285933 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.54.2.505| pmc=219696 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=4285933}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli and initially used to characterise the proteins in the head of [[bacteriophage T4]].&lt;ref name="Laemmli1970"/&gt;

In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;"[http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=327327&amp;p=2195975 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/secondary Secondary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[document]] or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a [[primary source]], which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. 

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. 
 
The most accurate [[#Classification|classification]] for any given source is not always obvious.  ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121|quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Classification==
Information can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called '''symbolic sources'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OX7d7u_2rF4C&amp;pg=PA121|title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=1989-11-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521389211|location=|pages=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a [[midden]], regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kragh|1989|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalton|Charnigo|2004|p=419 n.18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delgadillo|Lynch|1999|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an [[obituary]]&lt;ref name="Duffin"&gt;{{Citation|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name="Duffin" /&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Henige|first=David|authorlink=David Henige|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further "levels". One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.

Some other [[modern language]]s use more than one word for the English word "source". [[German language|German]] usually uses ''Sekundärliteratur'' ("secondary literature") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' ("secondary source") to [[historiography]]. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source which can tell about a lost ''Primärquelle'' ("primary source"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.

==Science, technology, and medicine==
In general, secondary sources are self-described as [[Review journal|review article]]s or [[meta-analysis]].

Primary source materials are typically defined as "original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study." An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in [[IMRAD]] style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrard, Judith |title=Health Sciences Literature Review Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSbfIcjQUcsC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|date= 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010/&gt; A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.

A [[book review]] that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.

===Library and information science===

In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=UMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2/&gt;

=== Maths ===

An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title=Riemann's Zeta Function|year=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|publication-place=Mineola, New York|isbn=0-486-41740-9|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22|quote=The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role.

===Humanities and history===
Secondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source.
The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.  In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Helge (1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In  original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cipolla|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Leopold von Ranke|Rankean model]] established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use [[archive]]s of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick C. Beiser|title=The German Historicist Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ1k6w0dFIMC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Camic|author2=Neil Gross|author3=Michele Lamont|title=Social Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l7iDZY-MSoC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law====
In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the [[headnote]]s of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bouchoux|first=Deborah E.|year=2000|title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form|page=45|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1893-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family history====
"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."&lt;ref&gt;Harland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.

====Autobiographies====
An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, particularly the introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35327">'''Source criticism''' (or '''information evaluation''') is the process of evaluating an [[information source]], i.e. a document, a person, a speech, a fingerprint, a photo, an observation, or anything used in order to obtain knowledge. In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid,  reliable or relevant. Broadly, "source criticism" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.

== Meaning ==

Problems in translation: The Danish word "kildekritik" like the Norwegian word "kildekritikk" and the Swedish word "källkritik" derived from the German "Quellenkritik" and is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886). Hardtwig writes: "His [Ranke's] first work ''Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen Völker'' von 1494&amp;ndash;1514 (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, ''Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber'' (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of [[textual criticism]] used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing" (Hardtwig, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12739).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries would be dominated by the research-oriented
conception of historical method of the so-called
Historical School in Germany, led by historians as
Leopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception
of history, long been regarded as the beginning
of modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the
'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the
methodical character of history to source criticism" (Lorenz, 2001).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bible studies dominate the use of "source criticism" in America (cf. Hjørland, 2008). The term is thus relatively seldom used in English about [[historical method]]s and [[historiography]] (cf. Hjørland, 2008). This difference between European and American use of "source criticism" is somewhat strange considering the influence of Ranke on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been suggested that differences in the use of the term are not accidental but due to different views of the historical method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the German/Scandinavian tradition this subject is seen as important, whereas in the Anglo-American tradition it is believed that historical methods must be specific and associated with the subject studied, for which reason there is no general field of "source criticism"{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

In the Scandinavian countries and elsewhere source evaluation (or information evaluation) is also studied interdisciplinarily from many different points of view, partly caused by the influence of the Internet. It is a growing field in, among other fields, [[library and information science]]. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2012). Methods for evaluating information sources: An annotated catalogue. Journal of information science. 38(3), 258-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balin, A. &amp; Grafstein, A. (2010). The critical assessment of research: Traditional and new methods of evaluation. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, Olden-Jørgensen (1998) and Thurén (1997) written by historians:
* Human sources may be relics (e.g. a fingerprint) or narratives (e.g. a statement or a letter). Relics are more credible sources than narratives.
*  A given source may be forged or corrupted; strong indications of the originality of the source increases its reliability.
*  The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened
* A [[primary source]] is more reliable than a [[secondary source]], which in turn is more reliable than a [[tertiary source]] and so on.
*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.
* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.
*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness (or source) has no direct interest in creating bias, the credibility of the message is increased.

We may add the following principles:
* Knowledge of source criticism cannot substitute subject knowledge:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The reliability of a given source is relative to the questions put to it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand" (Savolainen, 2007).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):

#How was the source located?
#What type of source is it?
#Who is the author and what are the qualifications of the author in regard to the topic that is discussed?
#When was the information published?
#In which country was it published?
#What is the reputation of the publisher?
#Does the source show a particular cultural or political bias?

For literary sources we might add complementing criteria:

#Does the source contain a bibliography?
#Has the material been reviewed by a group of peers, or has it been edited?
#How does the article/book compare with similar articles/books?

==Levels of generality==
How general are principles of source criticism?
Some principles are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources. One may ask whether principles of source criticism are unique to the humanities?

There is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between natural science and humanities. [[Logical positivism]] claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas [[hermeneutics]] is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of [[Jürgen Habermas]]. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory.  The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus "doubly hermeneutic".

Natural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and, for example, [[academic fraud]]).

==Contributing fields==

===Epistemology===
Epistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources. [[Empiricism]] evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid. [[Rationalism]] provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful observations must be grasped by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view. [[Historicism]] evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development. [[Pragmatism]] evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.

The evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If we accept the principle of [[fallibilism]] we also have to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section is source criticism intimately linked to [[scientific method]]s.

The presence of '''fallacies of argument''' in sources is another kind of philosophical criteria for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the 'ad hominem fallacy' (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the 'straw man fallacy' (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) See also [[fallacy]].

===Research methodology===
Research methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook &amp; Crouch (1998). See also [[Unobtrusive measures]], [[Triangulation (social science)]].

===Science studies===
Studies of quality evaluation processes such as [[peer review]], [[book review]]s and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of [[scientific misconduct]].

Harris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, [[Little Albert]], has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of [[reception history]] (how Watson's paper was received).  It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.

===Textual criticism===
Textual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of [[philology]], which is not just devoted to the study  of texts, but also to edit and produce "scientific editions", "scholarly editions", "standard editions", "historical editions", "reliable editions", "reliable texts", "text editions"  or "critical editions", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept "source criticism" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed "kildekritisk udgave" (directly translated "source critical edition").

In other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce "scholarly editions". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.

===Psychology===
The study of [[eyewitness testimony]] is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More  subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that [[eyewitness memory]] is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.

Anderson (1978) and Anderson &amp; Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.

In psychoanalysis  the concept of [[defence mechanism]] is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.

===Library and information science (LIS)===
In schools of library and information science (LIS) is source criticism of taught as part of the growing field [[Information literacy]].
Study issues like [[relevance]], quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) and related issues are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. [[Bibliometrics]] is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. The study of [[book review]]s and their function in evaluating books should also be mentioned. The well-known comparison of Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica (Giles, 2005) - although not done by information scientists - contained an interview with an information scientist (Michael Twidale) and should be obvious to include in LIS.

It could be argued that library and information education should provide teaching in source criticism at least at the same level as is taught in Upper Secondary School  (see Gudmundsson, 2007).

In library and information science the checklist approach has often been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212549/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): "Chucking the checklist".

Libraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html General Source Criticism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304184332/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html Topicality and Reliability of Printed Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215004102/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html |date=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library of Congress has a "Teaching with Primary Sources" (TPS) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/about/|title=About the Program- Teaching with Primary Sources - Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Source criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the  protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., [[Whistleblower]]).

==In specific domains==

===Photos===


{{See also|Photo manipulation}}

Photos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/was-the-dear-leader-photoshopped-in/?scp=7&amp;sq=Kim%20Jong-il&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Was the Dear Leader Photoshopped In? | first=Jack | last=Healy | date=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet sources===


{{See also|E-mail fraud|Internet fraud}}

Much interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as [[Wikipedia]]) is reflected in the scholarly literature of [[Library and information science]] and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch &amp; Cromwell (2001), Leth &amp; Thurén (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, &amp; Oliver (1997).

=== Archaeology and history ===
"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, ''Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem'' (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved." (Lorenz, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;6870).

As written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).

Two of the best-known rule books from History's childhood are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois &amp; Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell &amp; Prevenier, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;70-71):
# If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proved.
# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis.
# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.
# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most "authority" - - i.e. the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.
# Eyewittnesses are, in general, to be preferred, especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.
# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measureably enhanced.
# When two sources disagree (and there is no other means of evaluation), then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.

Gudmundsson (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;38) writes:  "Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to "tendency analysis".

In [[archaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]] is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on "scientific" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both "source criticism" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of "source materials" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as [[facsimile]]s or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s).

[[Historiography]] and [[Historical method]] include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.

===Biblical studies===
{{Main|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}
Source criticism, as the term is used in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term "literary criticism" is occasionally used as a synonym.

Biblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of Classical antiquity ([[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as "the [[Higher Criticism]]", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.

Related to Source Criticism is [[Redaction Criticism]] which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is [[form criticism]] and [[tradition history]] which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.

===Journalism===

{{See also|Journalism fraud}}

Journalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of [[information source]]s such as [[news bureau]]s, persons which may be interviewed, [[newspaper]]s, [[Academic journal|journals]] and so on (see [[journalism sourcing]]). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.

===Legal studies===

{{See also|Evidence (law)}}

The most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: [[Legal positivism]] is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while [[legal realism]], [[interpretivism (legal)]], [[critical legal studies]] and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.

'''Abstract''':  When classifying the array of interpretive methods currently available, biblical critics regularly distinguish between historical-critical methods, on the one hand, and literary critical methods, on the other. Frequently, methods on one side of the divide are said to be antagonistic to certain methods on the other. This article examines two such presumed antagonistic methods, source criticism and deconstructive criticism, and argues that they are not, in fact, antagonistic, but similar: both are postmodern movements, and both share an interpretive methodology (insofar as it is correct to speak of a deconstructive methodology). This argument is illustrated with a source-critical and a deconstructive reading of Exodus 14.

==Description==
In [[historiography]], distinctions are commonly made between three kinds of source texts:

===Primary===
{{main|Primary source}}
[[Primary source]]s are firsthand written [[evidence]] of history made at the [[time]] of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_"&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=2005-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with "direct, unmediated information about the object of study."&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

These are also usually authoritative and fundamental documents concerning the subject under consideration.

--&gt; Physical objects can be primary sources.

===Secondary and tertiary===
{{main|Secondary source|Tertiary source}}
[[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. 

[[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html Glossary, Using Information Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html |date=2008-08-28 }}. ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources".) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_" /&gt; These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are [[encyclopedia]]s and [[textbook]]s.

The distinction between  ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' is standard in [[historiography]], while the distinction between these sources and ''tertiary sources'' is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself.

==Types==
Below are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes ''generally'' the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). ''P'' is for Primary sources, ''S'' is for Secondary sources, and ''T'' is for Tertiary sources. (ed., those with ''?''s are indeterminate.)

==In translation==
In translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given [[Source language (translation)|source language]] which is to be, or has been, translated into another language. In translation the source text (ST) is transformed into a [[target text]] (TT), written in a given [[Target language (translation)|target language]]. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Translation scholars including [[Eugene Nida]] and [[Peter Newmark]] have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=67-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sources, such as the New Testament books in the Christian Bible, include detailed stories about Jesus but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus.&lt;ref name=MAPowell168 &gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee|first=Mark Allan|last=Powell|date=1998|isbn=0-664-25703-8|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two events subject to "almost universal assent" are that [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|was crucified]] by the order of the [[Roman governor|Roman Prefect]] [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=AmyJill1&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Amy-Jill|author-link=Amy-Jill Levine|title=The Historical Jesus in Context|editor=Amy-Jill Levine et al.|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00992-6|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JDunn339&gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus Remembered|first=James D.

Non-Christian sources that are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as [[Josephus]], and Roman sources such as [[Tacitus]]. These sources are compared to Christian sources such as the [[Pauline Epistles]] and the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. These sources are usually independent of each other (e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources), and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process.&lt;ref name="Camber121"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Jesus|first=Markus N.

In a review of the state of research, the Jewish scholar [[Amy-Jill Levine]] stated that "no single picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most scholars" and that all portraits of Jesus are subject to criticism by some group of scholars.&lt;ref name=AmyJill1 /&gt;

====Josephus====
{{Main article|Josephus on Jesus}}
[[File:Josephus Antiquitates Iudaice.jpg|thumb|170px|A page from a 1466 copy of ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'']]
The writings of the 1st century [[Roman citizenship|Romano]]-[[List of Jewish historians|Jewish historian]] [[Flavius Josephus]] include references to Jesus and the [[origins of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754&gt;Feldman, Louis H.; Hata, Gōhei, eds. (1987). ''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity'' BRILL. {{ISBN|978-90-04-08554-1}}. pp. 54–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284&gt;Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). ''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', written around 93–94&amp;nbsp;CE, includes two references to Jesus in Books [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|18]] and [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|20]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier9512&gt;Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). ''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two passages, the James passage in Book 20 is used by scholars to support the existence of Jesus, the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' in Book 18 his crucifixion.&lt;ref name="Camber121"/&gt; Josephus' James passage attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person and that some of his contemporaries considered him the Messiah.&lt;ref name=Camber121/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104&gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L. Scott; Quarles, Charles L. (2009). ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' {{ISBN|0-8054-4365-7}} pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bart Ehrman, Josephus' passage about Jesus was altered by a Christian scribe, including the reference to Jesus as the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Jesus Interrupted, p. 159, Harper Collins&lt;/ref&gt;

A textual argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that the use of the term "Christos" there seems unusual for Josephus.&lt;ref name=EB128&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 128–130&lt;/ref&gt; An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that, given that the mention of Jesus appears in the ''Antiquities'' before that of the John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John.&lt;ref name=EB128/&gt; A further argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=EB128/&gt;

The passage deals with the death of "James the brother of Jesus" in Jerusalem. Whereas the works of Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with [[Jesus (name)|the name Jesus]], this passage specifies that this Jesus was the one "who was called Christ".&lt;ref name=EB129&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter137&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.; Hata, Gōhei. ''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity''. Brill. {{ISBN|90-04-08554-8}}. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|Book 20, Chapter 9, 1]] of the ''Antiquities'' to "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James",&lt;ref name=Feldman557&gt;[[Louis Feldman]] ({{ISBN|90-04-08554-8}} pp. 55–57) states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been "almost universally acknowledged".&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst83&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham "For What Offense Was James Put to Death?" in ''James the Just and Christian origins'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1999 {{ISBN|90-04-11550-1}} pp. 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter134&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} pp. 134–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refsummary &gt;Sample quotes from previous references: Van Voorst ({{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 83) states that the overwhelming majority of scholars consider both the reference to "the brother of Jesus called Christ" and the entire passage that includes it as authentic."  Bauckham ({{ISBN|90-04-11550-1}} pp. 199–203) states: "the vast majority have considered it to be authentic". Meir ({{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 108–109) agrees with Feldman that few have questioned the authenticity of the James passage. Setzer ({{ISBN|0-8006-2680-X}} pp. 108–109) also states that few have questioned its authenticity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Testimonium Flavianum'' (meaning the testimony of Flavius [Josephus]) is the name given to the passage found in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Book 18, Chapter 3, 3]] of the ''Antiquities'' in which Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus; Whiston, William; Maier, Paul L.

''Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature. 2''. {{ISBN|90-232-2653-4}} pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have differing opinions on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in the passage to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt; The general scholarly view is that while the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate which was then subject to Christian interpolation.&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A. (2001). ''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' {{ISBN|0-391-04118-5}} p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wansbrough, Henry (2004).

The references found in ''Antiquities'' have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as the ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'', written twenty years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, such as that the ''Antiquities'' covers a longer time period and that during the twenty-year gap between the writing of the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 70 CE) and ''Antiquities'' (after 90 CE) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the ''Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.

The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] and [[Roman senate|senator]] [[Tacitus]] referred to [[Jesus|Christ]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his execution]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] and the existence of [[early Christians]] in Rome in his final work, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' (c. AD 116), [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15, chapter 44]].&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Easterling, E. J.

Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus."

Scholars generally consider Tacitus's reference to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]] to be both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source about early Christianity that is in unison with other historical records.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans42  &gt;''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' by Craig A.

[[John Dominic Crossan]] considers the passage important in establishing that Jesus existed and was crucified, and states: "That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact."&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, John Dominic (1995). Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography. HarperOne. {{ISBN|0-06-061662-8}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart D.

Although the majority of scholars consider it to be genuine, a few scholars question the authenticity of the passage given that Tacitus was born 25&amp;nbsp;years after Jesus' death.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;

Some scholars have debated the historical value of the passage given that Tacitus does not reveal the source of his information.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce,''Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament'', (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1974) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerd Theissen]] and Annette Merz argue that Tacitus at times had drawn on earlier historical works now lost to us, and he may have used official sources from a Roman archive in this case; however, if Tacitus had been copying from an official source, some scholars would expect him to have labeled Pilate correctly as a ''prefect'' rather than a ''procurator''.&lt;ref&gt;Theissen and Merz p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Theissen and Merz state that Tacitus gives us a description of widespread prejudices about Christianity and a few precise details about "Christus" and Christianity, the source of which remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Theissen, Gerd |author2=Merz, Annette | title=The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide |url = https://books.google.com/?id=3ZU97DQMH6UC&amp;pg=PA83| year=1998 | publisher=Fortress Press | location=Minneapolis  | isbn=978-0-8006-3122-2 | page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul R. Eddy has stated that given his position as a senator Tacitus was also likely to have had access to official Roman documents of the time and did not need other sources.&lt;ref name=Eddy181 &gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels'' by Paul R. Eddy, et al 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Martin notes that the authenticity of this passage of the Annals has also been disputed on the grounds that Tacitus would not have used the word “messiah” in an authentic Roman document.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Christianity, By Michael Martin, pp. 50–51, at https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkC4dTmK0AC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=historicity+of+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o-_8U5-yEtTH7AbBpoCoAg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver notes that Tacitus spoke of the persecution of Christians, but no other Christian author wrote of this persecution for a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Jesus in the Twentieth Century: 1900–1950, By Walter P. Weaver, pp. 53, 57, at https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=historicity+of+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o-_8U5-yEtTH7AbBpoCoAg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotema notes that this passage was not quoted by any Church father up to the 15th century, although the passage would have been very useful to them in their work;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.za"&gt;Secret of Regeneration, By Hilton Hotema, p. 100, at https://books.google.com/books?id=jCaopp3R5B0C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=interpolations+in+tacitus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CRf-U9-VGZCe7AbxrIDQCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=interpolations%20in%20tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and that the passage refers to the Christians in Rome being a multitude, while at that time the Christian congregation in Rome would actually have been very small.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.za"/&gt;

[[Richard Carrier]] has put forward the ideas that the 'Christ, the author of this name, was executed by the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius' line is a Christian interpolation and that Tacitus wrote about Chrestians not Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Richard (2014) "The Prospect of a Christian Interpolation in Tacitus, Annals 15.44" ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Volume 68, Issue 3, pp. 264–283 (an earlier and more detailed version appears in Carrier's ''Hitler Homer Bible Christ'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Richard (2014) ''On the Historicity of Jesus'' Sheffield Phoenix Press {{ISBN|978-1-909697-49-2}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also debated the issue of hearsay in the reference by Tacitus. Charles Guignebert argued that "So long as there is that possibility [that Tacitus is merely echoing what Christians themselves were saying], the passage remains quite worthless".&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus'', University Books, New York, 1956, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; R. T. France states that the Tacitus passage is at best just Tacitus repeating what he had heard through Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=R. T. France|last=France|first=R.

The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Suetonius]] (c. 69 – after 122 CE) made references to [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and their leader in his work ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' (written 121 CE).&lt;ref name="Cradle110"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lives &gt;''Lives of the Caesars'' by Suetonius, Catharine Edwards 2001 {{ISBN|0192832719}} pp. 184. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 &gt;''Birth of Christianity'' by John Dominic Crossan 1999 {{ISBN|0567086682}} pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29 &gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient evidence'', Wm. B.

The earlier passage in Claudius, may include a reference to Jesus, but is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvorst29 /&gt; In [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] Suetonius refers to the expulsion of Jews by Claudius and states:&lt;ref name=lives /&gt;

:"Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome."

The reference in Claudius 25 involves the agitations in the Jewish community which led to the expulsion of some Jews from Rome by Claudius, and is likely the same event mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]).&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; Most historians date this expulsion to around AD 49–50.&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius refers to the leader of the Christians as ''Chrestus'', a term also used by [[Tacitus on Christ|used by Tacitus]], referred in Latin dictionaries as a (amongst other things) version of 'Christus'.&lt;ref name=France42 &gt;R. T. France. The Evidence for Jesus. (2006).

G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} pp. 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; This weakens the historical value of his reference as a whole, and there is no overall scholarly agreement about its value as a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt; However, the confusion of Suetonius also points to the lack of Christian interpolation, for a Christian scribe would not have confused the Jews with Christians.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt;

The Babylonian [[Talmud]] in a few cases includes possible references to Jesus using the terms "Yeshu", "Yeshu ha-Notzri", "ben Stada", and "ben Pandera". Some of these references probably date back to the [[Tannaim|Tannaitic period]] (70–200 CE).&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum107 &gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L.

[[Robert Van Voorst]] states that the scarcity of Jewish references to Jesus is not surprising, given that Jesus was not a prominent issue for the Jews during the first century, and after the devastation caused by the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in the year 70, Jewish scholars were focusing on preserving [[Judaism]] itself, rather than paying much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Eisenman argues that the derivation of Jesus of Nazareth from "ha-Notzri" is impossible on etymological grounds, as it would suggest rather "the [[Nazirite]]" rather than "the Nazarene".&lt;ref&gt;Einsenman, Robert (2002), "James; the Brother of Jesus" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Voorst states that although the question of who was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin 43a]]'' (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and there is little doubt that it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Leslie693&gt;In ''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' edited by J. L. Houlden (2006) {{ISBN|082648011X}} pp. 693–694&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst117118&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000).

Tuckett]] states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 {{ISBN|0521796784}} p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the passage is a [[Tannaitic]] reference to the trial and death of Jesus at Passover and is most likely earlier than other references to Jesus in the Talmud.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt; The passage reflects hostility toward Jesus among the rabbis and includes this text:&lt;ref name=Blom280&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is taught: On the eve of Passover they hung Yeshu and the crier went forth for forty days beforehand declaring that "[Yeshu] is going to be stoned for practicing witchcraft, for enticing and leading Israel astray.

But no one had anything exonerating for him and they hung him on the eve of Passover.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 43a.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Schäfer]] states that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not [[Tannaitic]] but from a later [[Amoraic]] period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them.&lt;ref name=PeterS141&gt;''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (2009) {{ISBN|0691143188}} pp. 141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart Ehrman]] and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (1998) {{ISBN|0664257038}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference in early second century Rabbinic literature ([[Tosefta|Tosefta Hullin]] II 22) refers to Rabbi Eleazar ben Dama who was bitten by a snake, but was denied healing in the name of Jesus by another Rabbi for it was against the law, and thus died.&lt;ref name=Bammel393/&gt; This passage reflects the attitude of Jesus' early Jewish opponents, i.e. that his miracles were based on evil powers.&lt;ref name=Bammel393&gt;''Jesus and the Politics of his Day'' by E. Bammel and C. F. D. Moule (1985) {{ISBN|0521313449}} p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kee71&gt;''The Beginnings of Christianity'' by Howard Clark Kee (2005) {{ISBN|0567027414}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy and Boyd, who question the value of several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence.&lt;ref name=BEddy170/&gt; [[R. T. France]] and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. France ''The Evidence for Jesus'' 2006 {{ISBN|1573833703}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 {{ISBN|0865546770}} pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as [[Celsus]].&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt; [[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;

{{Main article|Pliny the Younger on Christians|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

'''[[Pliny the Younger]]''' (c. 61 – c. 112), the provincial governor of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Bithynia]], wrote to [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] ''c''. 112 [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|concerning how to deal with Christians]], who refused to [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|worship the emperor]], and instead worshiped "Christus". Charles Guignebert, who does not doubt that Jesus of the Gospels lived in Gallilee in the 1st century, nevertheless dismisses this letter as acceptable evidence for a historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus, by Ch. Gugnebert, Translated from the French by S. H. Hooke, University Book, New York, 1956, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]]''', of whom very little is known, and none of whose writings survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which [[Eusebius]] referred. [[Sextus Julius Africanus|Julius Africanus]], writing ''c'' 221, links a reference in the third book of the ''History'' to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts in three of the Gospels .&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Africanus, ''Extant Writings'' XVIII in ''Ante-Nicene Fathers'', ed. A. Roberts and J. Donaldson (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1973) vol. VI, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 &gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 122–126&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49–52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89–92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112–109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD.  All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/thallus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Phlegon of Tralles]]''', AD 80–140, similar to Thallus, Julius Africanus mentions a historian named Phlegon who wrote a chronicle of history around AD 140, where he records:
“Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth to the ninth hour.” (Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)  Phlegon is also mentioned by Origen (an early church theologian and scholar, born in Alexandria):
“Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, I think, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events . . . but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 14)
“And with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place … ” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 33)
“Jesus, while alive, was of no assistance to himself, but that he arose after death, and exhibited the marks of his punishment, and showed how his hands had been pierced by nails.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 59).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html see book 2, chapter 33 and 59&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eusebius in The Chronicon (written in the 4th century AD) records what Phlegon said verbatim. "Now, in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad [32 AD], a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour [noon] that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars could be seen in heaven, and the earth moved in Bithynia, toppling many buildings in the city of Nicaea." Phlegon never mentions Jesus or the 3 hour darkness.  He also mentions a solar eclipse, which can not occur at Passover. Apart from the year (which may be a corruption), this description fits an earthquake and eclipse that occurred in North West Turkey on November, 29 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=00291124&lt;/ref&gt;

While the statements of Celsus may be seen as valuable, they have little historical value, given that the wording of the original writings can not be examined.&lt;ref name=Voorst6568&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

===Disputed sources===
The following sources are disputed, and of limited historical value, but they are at least proof of Christians existing and being known and talked about in the first and second centuries.
* [[Lucian on Jesus|Lucian of Samosata]] (born 115 CE), a well-known [[Greek people|Greek]] satirist and traveling lecturer [[Lucian on Jesus|wrote mockingly of the followers of Jesus]] for their ignorance and credulity.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert E. Van Voorst 2000. pp 58-64"&gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 58–64&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Lucian's understanding of Christian traditions has significant gaps and errors, his writing is unlikely to have been influenced by Christians themselves, and he may provide an independent statement about the crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt; However, given the nature of the text as satire, Lucian may have embellished the stories he heard and his account cannot have a high degree of historical reliability.&lt;ref name="Robert E. Van Voorst 2000. pp 58-64"/&gt;
* [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] (c. 53–117), in reply to a letter sent by [[Pliny the Younger]], wrote "You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it—that is, by worshiping our gods—even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age."
* [[Epictetus]] (AD 55–135) provides another possible yet disputed reference to Christians as "Galileans" in his "Discourses" 4.7.6 and 2.9.19–21: "Therefore, if madness can produce this attitude [of detachment] toward these things [death, loss of family, property], and also habit, as with the Galileans, can no one learn from reason and demonstration that God has made all things in the universe, and the whole universe itself, to be unhindered and complete in itself, and the parts of it to serve the needs of the whole."
* [[Numenius of Apamea]], in the second century, wrote a possible allusion to Christians and Christ that is contained in fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the Academicians and Plato, on the Good (in which according to Origen, Contra Celsum, iv. 51, he makes an allusion to Jesus Christ).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen164.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Galen|Claudius Galenus (Galen)]] (AD 129–200) may reference Christ and his followers;  From Galen, De differentiis pulsuum (On the pulse), iii, 3. The work is listed in De libris propriis 5, and seems to belong between 176–192 AD, or possibly even 176–180: "One might more easily teach novelties to the followers of Moses and Christ than to the physicians and philosophers who cling fast to their schools"&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=NmZ7Q1-8QkEC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=One+might+more+easily+teach+novelties+to+the+followers+of+Moses+and+Christ+than+to+the+physicians+and+philosophers+who+cling+fast+to+their+schools&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Iu54l5PSMP&amp;sig=Q8nlSJJRzBzUrAgqCeupkpIHjP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic_umTobXPAhVGw2MKHe7sAU0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=One%20might%20more%20easily%20teach%20novelties%20to%20the%20followers%20of%20Moses%20and%20Christ%20than%20to%20the%20physicians%20and%20philosophers%20who%20cling%20fast%20to%20their%20schools&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====James Ossuary====
{{Main article|James Ossuary}}
There is a limestone burial box from the 1st century known as the [[James Ossuary]] with the Aramaic inscription, "James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus."  The authenticity of the inscription was challenged by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], who filed a complaint with the Israeli police. In 2012, the owner of the ossuary was found not guilty, with the judge ruling that the authenticity of the ossuary inscription had not been proven either way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested it was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayalon, A., Bar-Matthews, M., &amp; Goren, Y. | year = 2004 | title = Authenticity examination of the inscription on the ossuary attributed to James, brother of Jesus | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1185–1189 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2004.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian sources==
Various books, memoirs and stories were written about Jesus by the early Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are believed to have been written within 50–70 years of the death of Jesus, with the [[Gospel of Mark]] believed to be the earliest, and the last the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp. xix–xx, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Burton L. (1996)"Who Wrote the New Testament: the making of a Christian Myth"(Harper One)&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a short letter by [[St Paul]]: the [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]], which appeared about 25 years after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Buetz, Jeffrey J.(2005), "The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Teachings of Christianity".(Inner Traditions)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Ehrman]], [[Robert Eisenman]] and others critical of traditional Christian views, in assessing the problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by people who did not know Jesus, see anything he did, or hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (2010), "Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them)" (Harper One 1 Reprint edition (2 February 2010)). pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einsenman, Robert (2002), "james, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}

====Overview====
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|150px|A page from [[2 Corinthians]] in [[Papyrus 46]], c. AD 200]]
In the context of Christian sources, even if all other texts are ignored, the [[Pauline epistles]] can provide some information regarding Jesus.&lt;ref name="Tuckett126"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38 /&gt; This information does not include a narrative of the life of Jesus, and refers to his existence as a person, but adds few specific items apart from his death by crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Furnish43&gt;Victor Furnish in ''Paul and Jesus'' edited by Alexander J. M. Wedderburn 2004 (Academic Paperback) {{ISBN|0567083969}} pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; This information comes from those letters of Paul whose authenticity is not disputed.&lt;ref name=McK38&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 {{ISBN|0865546770}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was not a companion of Jesus and claims his information comes from the holy spirit acquired after Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;From Jesus to Christianity, San Francisco: HarperCollins, 2004 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the thirteen letters that bear Paul's name, seven are considered authentic by almost all scholars, and the others are generally considered [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name=EerdDunn&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' by James D. G. Dunn (19 Nov 2003) {{ISBN|0802837115}} p. 1274 "There is general scholarly agreement that seven of the thirteen letters beariing Pau's name are authentic, but his authorship of the other six cannot be taken for granted... Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philomen are certainly Paul's own."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune9&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' by David E. Aune {{ISBN|1405108258}} p. 9 "... seven of the letters attributed to Paul are almost universally accepted as authentic (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, Philomen)..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins4 &gt;Pheme Perkins, ''Reading the New Testament: An Introduction'' (Paulist Press, 1988), {{ISBN|0809129396}} pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The 7 undisputed letters (and their approximate dates) are: [[1 Thessalonians]] (c. 51 CE), [[Philippians]] (c. 52–54 CE), [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] (c. 52–54 CE), [[1 Corinthians]] (c. 53–54 CE), [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] (c. 55 CE), [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 55–56 CE) and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] (c. 55–58 CE).&lt;ref name=EerdDunn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The authenticity of these letters is accepted by almost all scholars, and they have been referenced and interpreted by early authors such as [[Origen]] and [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref name=Aune9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gorday&gt;Peter Gorday in ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' by Harold W. Attridge 1992 {{ISBN|0814323618}} pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the Pauline epistles are generally dated to AD 50 to AD 60, they are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; These letters were written approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus, around AD 30–36.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The letters were written during a time when Paul recorded encounters with the disciples of Jesus, e.g. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:18|Galatians 1:18]] states that several years after his conversion Paul went to Jerusalem and stayed with Apostle Peter for fifteen days.&lt;ref name=Adams94&gt;Edward Adams "Paul, Jesus and Christ" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 {{ISBN|140519362X}} pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Paul disputed the nature of Jesus' message with Jesus's brother James, concerning the importance of adhering to kosher food restrictions and circumcision, important features of determining Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Buetz, Jeffrey (op cit)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (op cit)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters were not intended to provide a narrative of the life of Jesus, but were written as expositions of Christian teachings.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt; In Paul's view, the earthly life of Jesus was of a lower importance than the theology of his death and resurrection,a theme that permeates Pauline writings.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul&gt;James D. G. Dunn "Paul's understanding of the death of Jesus" in ''Sacrifice and Redemption'' edited by S. W. Sykes (2007) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|052104460X}} pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pauline letters clearly indicate that for Paul Jesus was a real person (born of a woman as in Gal 4.4), a Jew ("born under the law", Romans 1.3) who had disciples (1 Corinthians 15.5), who was crucified (as in 1 Corinthians 2.2 and Galatians 3.1) and who resurrected from the dead (1 Corinthians 15.20, Romans 1.4 and 6.5, Philippians 3:10–11).&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt; And the letters reflect the general concept within the early Gentillic Christian Church that Jesus existed, was crucified and was raised from the dead.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;

The references by Paul to Jesus do not in themselves prove the existence of Jesus, but they do establish that the existence of Jesus was the accepted norm within the early Christians (including the Christian community in Jerusalem, given the references to collections there) twenty to thirty years after the death of Jesus, at a time when those who could have been acquainted with him could still be alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0805444823}} pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0860120066}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Matera 2007 {{ISBN|0814659721}} p. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; It also implies that Peter was already known to the Galatians and required no introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Galatians'' by Martinus C. de Boer 2011 {{ISBN|0664221238}} p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#9:5|1 Corinthians 9:5]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:19|Galatians 1:19]] state that Jesus had brothers, one being called James, whom Paul met or "saw."&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish43/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; James was claimed by early Christian writers as Origen and Eusebius to have been the leader of the followers of Jesus, after his brother's death, and to have been the first bishop, or [[archbishop|bishop of bishops]] in Jerusalem.
* ''Betrayal and rituals'': That Jesus was betrayed and established some traditions such as the [[Eucharist]] are derived from [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|1 Corinthians 11:23–25]] which states: "The Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.".&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;
* ''Crucifixion'': The Pauline letters include several references to the crucifixion of Jesus e.g. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|
1 Corinthians 11:23]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:2|
1 Corinthians 2:2]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:1|
Galatians 3:1]] among others.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; The death of Jesus forms a central element of the Pauline letters.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul/&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:15|1 Thessalonians 2:15]] places the responsibility for the death of Jesus on some Jews.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; Moreover the statement in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:14|1 Thessalonians 2:14–16]] about the Jews "who both killed the Lord Jesus" and "drove out us" indicates that the death of Jesus was within the same time frame as the persecution of Paul.&lt;ref name=Eddy46&gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels' by Paul R. Eddy, Gregory A. Boyd 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Burial'': [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:4|1 Corinthians 15:4]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#6:4|Romans 6:4]] state that following his death Jesus was [[empty tomb|buried]] (but does not mention a tomb).&lt;ref name=Furnish19&gt;''Jesus according to Paul'' by Victor Paul Furnish 1994 {{ISBN|0521458242}} pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; This reference is then used by Paul to build on the theology of resurrection, but reflects the common belief at the time that Jesus was buried after his death.&lt;ref&gt;''1 Corinthians'' by Richard Oster 1995 {{ISBN|0899006337}} p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology'' by Udo Schnelle (1 Nov 2005) {{ISBN|0801027969}} pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of only these references to Jesus in the Pauline epistles has given rise to criticism of them by [[G. A. Wells]], who is generally accepted as a leader of the movement to deny the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=WellsT49 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Casey39 /&gt; When Wells was still denying the existence of Jesus, he criticized the Pauline epistles for not mentioning items such as John the Baptist or Judas or the trial of Jesus and used that argument to conclude that Jesus was not a historical figure.&lt;ref name=WellsT49/&gt;&lt;ref name= Casey39&gt;'Jesus of Nazareth: An independent historian's account of his life and teaching'' by Maurice Casey pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Dunn29&gt;''The Evidence for Jesus'' by James D. G. Dunn (1986) {{ISBN|0664246982}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James D. G. Dunn]] addressed Wells' statement and stated that he knew of no other scholar that shared that view, and most other scholars had other and more plausible explanations for the fact that Paul did not include a narrative of the life of Jesus in his letters, which were primarily written as religious documents rather than historical chronicles at a time when the life story of Jesus could have been well known within the early Church.&lt;ref name= Dunn29 /&gt; Dunn states that despite Wells' arguments, the theories of the non-existence of Jesus are a "thoroughly dead thesis".&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt;

While Wells no longer denies the existence of Jesus, he has responded to Dunn, stating that his [[arguments from silence]] not only apply to Paul but all early Christian authors, and that he still has a low opinion of early Christian texts, maintaining that for Paul Jesus may have existed a good number of decades before.&lt;ref name=WellsT49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells 2003 {{ISBN|0812695674}} p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Pauline creeds====
{{Main article|Creed}}
The Pauline letters sometimes refer to creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate their writings.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;&lt;ref name=RMartin57 &gt;''Worship in the Early Church'' by Ralph P. Martin 1975 {{ISBN|0802816134}} pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3–4]] reads: "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."&lt;ref name=Kruse41 &gt;''Paul's Letter to the Romans'' by Colin G. Kruse (2012) {{ISBN|0802837433}} pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#1:3|Romans 1:3–4]] refers to Romans 1:2 just before it which mentions an existing gospel, and in effect may be treating it as an earlier creed.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;

One of the keys to identifying a pre-Pauline tradition is given in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:11|1 Corinthians 15:11]]&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt;

: Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

Here Paul refers to others before him who preached the creed.&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt; James Dunn states that [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3]] indicates that in the 30s Paul was taught about the death of Jesus a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'', Volume 1 by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters thus contain Christian creed elements of pre-Pauline origin.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964) p. 47

* R. E. Brown, ''The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus'' (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81, 92&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquity of the creed has been located by many Biblical scholars to less than a decade after Jesus' death, originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfhart Pannenberg, ''Jesus – God and Man'' translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968)p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, ''The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology'', ed.

M. Hunter said, "The passage therefore preserves uniquely early and verifiable testimony. It meets every reasonable demand of historical reliability."&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hunter, ''Works and Words of Jesus'' (1973) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

These creeds date to within a few years of Jesus' death, and developed within the Christian community in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Leith12 &gt;''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H. Leith (1982) {{ISBN|0804205264}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Although embedded within the texts of the New Testament, these creeds are a distinct source for [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name=BAune &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' edited by David E. Aune 2010 {{ISBN|1405108258}} p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that existence and death of Jesus was part of Christian belief a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles.&lt;ref name=Leith12 /&gt;

===Gospels===
{{see also|Historical Jesus|Synoptic problem|Historicity of the canonical Gospels}}
[[Image:P52 recto.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]], a papyrus fragment from a codex (c. 90–160), one of the earliest known New Testament manuscripts.]]
The four canonical gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], are the main sources for the biography of Jesus' life, the teachings and actions attributed to him.&lt;ref name=Blomb442 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 &gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2416-5}} pp. 52–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans465 &gt;The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pp. 465–477&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are known as the [[synoptic Gospels]], from the Greek σύν (syn "together") and ὄψις (opsis "view"), given that they display a high degree of similarity in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament Theology by Paul Haffner'' 2008 {{ISBN|88-902268-0-3}} p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to the Gospels'' by W. Graham Scroggie 1995 {{ISBN|0-8254-3744-X}} p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation in the fourth canonical gospel, i.e. John, differs from these three in that it has more of a thematic nature rather than a narrative format.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 /&gt; Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington 1998 {{ISBN|0-8146-5806-7}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the New Testament generally showed little interest in an absolute [[chronology of Jesus]] or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pp. 730–731&lt;/ref&gt; The gospels were primarily written as theological documents in the context of [[early Christianity]] with the chronological timelines as a secondary consideration.&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 &gt;''Interpreting Gospel Narratives: Scenes, People, and Theology'' by Timothy Wiarda 2010 {{ISBN|0-8054-4843-8}} pp. 75–78&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of the gospels being theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} p. 613&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, scholars have used them to reconstruct a number of portraits of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanders3&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus'' {{ISBN|0140144994}} Penguin, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]] the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Gerald3 &gt;''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 {{ISBN|0-19-955787-X}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have varying degrees of certainty about the historical reliability of the accounts in the gospels, and the only two events whose historicity is the subject of almost universal agreement among scholars are the [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt; Scholars such as [[E.P. Sanders]] and separately [[Craig A. Evans]] go further and assume that two other events in the gospels are historically certain, namely that Jesus [[Twelve apostles|called disciples]], and caused a [[Cleansing of the Temple|controversy at the Temple]].&lt;ref name="Evans37"/&gt;

Ever since the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], scholars continue to debate the order in which the gospels were written, and how they may have influenced each other, and several hypothesis exist in that regard, e.g. the [[Markan priority]] hypothesis holds that the Gospel of Mark was written first c. 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' edited by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802837115}} pp. 1064–1065&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|authorlink=John P. Meier|title=A Marginal Jew|publisher=Doubleday|year=1991|location=New York City|pages=v.2 955–6|isbn=0-385-46993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, Matthew is placed at being sometime after this date and Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 CE.&lt;ref name="Harris Gospels"&gt;[[Stephen L. Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "The Gospels" pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the competing, and more popular, [[Q source]] hypothesis, the gospels were not independently written, but were derived from a common source called Q.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q–Z'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (1995) {{ISBN|0802837840}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[two-source hypothesis]] then proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark as well as on Q.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'' by Robert L. Thomas 2002 {{ISBN|0825438381}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospels can be seen as having three separate lines: A literary line which looks at it from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst7&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Church fathers===
[[File:Eusebius of Caesarea.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eusebius of Caesarea]]]]
Two possible [[Church Fathers|patristic sources]] that may refer to eye witness encounters with Jesus are the early references of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] and [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]], reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr22/&gt;

The works of Papias have not survived, but [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] quotes him as saying:&lt;ref name=Bauck15&gt;Richard Bauckham ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans, 2006), {{ISBN|0802831621}} pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"…if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders should come my way, I inquired about the words of the elders – that is, what according to the elders Andrew or Peter said, or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying."

[[Richard Bauckham]] states that while Papias was collecting his information (c. 90), Aristion and the elder John (who were Jesus' disciples) were still alive and teaching in [[Asia minor]], and Papias gathered information from people who had known them.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt; However, the exact identity of the "elder John" is wound up in the debate on the authorship of the [[Gospel of John]], and scholars have differing opinions on that, e.g. [[Jack Finegan]] states that Eusebius may have misunderstood what Papias wrote, and the elder John may be a different person from the author of the fourth gospel, yet still a disciple of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Finegan42 &gt;''The archeology of the New Testament'' by Jack Finegan (1981) {{ISBN|0709910061}} pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Burge]], on the other hand sees confusion on the part of Eusebius and holds the elder John to be different person from the apostle John.&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreting the Gospel of John'' by [[Gary M. Burge]] (1998) {{ISBN|0801010217}} pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter of Quadratus (possibly the first Christian apologist) to emperor [[Hadrian]] (who reigned 117 – 138) is likely to have an early date and is reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' 4.3.2 to have stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Eusebius: The Church History'' by Eusebius and Paul L. Maier (2007) {{ISBN|082543307X}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The words of our Savior were always present, for they were true: those who were healed, those who rose from the dead, those who were not only seen in the act of being healed or raised, but were also always present, not merely when the Savior was living on earth, but also for a considerable time after his departure, so that some of them survived even to our own times."&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 &gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

By "our Savior" Quadratus means Jesus and the letter is most likely written before AD 124.&lt;ref name=Carr22&gt;''The Early Christian Church: Volume 2, The Second Christian Century by Philip Carrington (2011) {{ISBN|0521157382}} pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that by "our times" he may refer to his early life, rather than when he wrote (117–124), which would be a reference contemporary with Papias.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that the importance of the statement attributed to Quadratus is that he emphasizes the "eye witness" nature of the testimonies to interaction with Jesus.&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 /&gt; Such "eye witness statements" abound in early Christian writings, particularly the [[pseudonymous]] Christian [[Apocrypha]], Gospels and Letters, in order to give them credibility.

===Apocryphal texts===
{{see also|Gnostic gospels|New Testament apocrypha}}
A number of later Christian texts, usually dating to the second century or later, exist as [[New Testament apocrypha]], among which the [[gnostic gospels]] have been of major recent interest among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; The 1945 discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] created a significant amount of scholarly interest and many modern scholars have since studied the gnostic gospels and written about them.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt; However, the trend among the 21st century scholars has been to accept that while the gnostic gospels may shed light on the progression of early Christian beliefs, they offer very little to contribute to the study of the historicity of Jesus, in that they are rather late writings, usually consisting of sayings (rather than narrative, similar to the hypothesised Q documents), their authenticity and authorship remain questionable, and various parts of them rely on components of the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72/&gt; The focus of modern research into the historical Jesus has been away from gnostic writings and towards the comparison of Jewish, [[Greco-Roman]] and [[canonical gospel|canonical]] Christian sources.&lt;ref name=Keener52 &gt;''The Historical Jesus of the Gospels'' by Craig S. Keener 2012 {{ISBN|0802868886}} pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} pp. 72–78&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, [[Bart Ehrman]] states that gnostic writings of the [[Gospel of Thomas]] (part of the Nag Hammadi library) have very little value in historical Jesus research, because the author of that gospel placed no importance on the physical experiences of Jesus (e.g. his crucifixion) or the physical existence of believers, and was only interested in the secret teachings of Jesus rather than any physical events.&lt;ref name=BartProphet72 /&gt; Similarly, the [[Apocryphon of John]] (also part of the Nag Hammadi library) has been useful in studying the prevailing attitudes in the second century, and questions of authorship regarding the [[Book of revelation]], given that it refers to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#1|Revelation 1:19]], but is mostly about the [[Ascension of Jesus|post ascension]] teachings of Jesus in a vision, not a narrative of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Revelation'' by [[Robert H. Mounce]] 1997 {{ISBN|0802825370}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Edward Arnal contend that the Gospel of Thomas continues to remain useful for understanding how the teachings of Jesus were transmitted among early Christians, and sheds light on the development of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolic Jesus'' by William Edward Arnal 2005 {{ISBN|1845530071}} pp. 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is overlap between the sayings of Jesus in the apocryphal texts and canonical Christian writings, and those not present in the canonical texts are called [[agrapha]]. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Robert Van Voorst states that the vast majority of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as seven as authentic, others as high as 18 among the more than 200, rendering them of little value altogether.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 /&gt;

[[File:Web 2.0 Map.svg|thumb|right|250px|A [[tag cloud]] with terms related to [[Web 2.0]]]]

In [[information system]]s, a '''tag''' is a [[Index term|keyword or term]] assigned to a piece of information (such as an [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|Internet bookmark]], [[digital image]], database [[Record (computer science)|record]], or [[computer file]]). This kind of [[metadata]] helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching.&lt;ref&gt;Some users, however, see tags not as metadata but as "just more content": {{cite book |last1=Berendt |first1=Bettina |last2=Hanser |first2=Christoph |date=2007 |chapter=Tags are not metadata, but 'just more content'—to some people |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM), Boulder, Colorado, USA, March 26–28, 2007 |location=Menlo Park, CA |publisher=[[International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence]] |oclc=799635928 |chapterurl=http://icwsm.org/papers/2--Berendt-Hanser.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system, although they may also be chosen from a [[controlled vocabulary]].&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Gene |date=2008 |title=Tagging: people-powered metadata for the social web |location=Berkeley |publisher=[[New Riders Press]] |isbn=9780321529176 |oclc=154806677}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}}

Tagging was popularized by [[website]]s associated with [[Web 2.0]] and is an important feature of many Web 2.0 services.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breslin |first1=John G. |last2=Passant |first2=Alexandre |last3=Decker |first3=Stefan |date=2009 |title=The social semantic web |location=Heidelberg; New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=9783642011719 |oclc=506401195 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also part of other [[database system]]s, [[desktop application]]s, and [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref name="JonesHafner2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Rodney H. |last2=Hafner |first2=Christoph A. |date=2012 |chapter=Networks and organization |title=Understanding digital literacies: a practical introduction |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=23–28 |isbn=9780415673167 |oclc=711041611 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uySkGNM4RAC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
People use tags to aid [[Classification (machine learning)|classification]], mark ownership, note [[Boundary critique|boundaries]], and indicate [[online identity]]. Tags may take the form of words, images, or other identifying marks. An analogous example of tags in the physical world is [[museum]] object tagging. People were using textual [[Index term|keyword]]s to [[Document classification|classify information]] and objects long before computers. Computer based [[search algorithm]]s made the use of such keywords a rapid way of exploring records.

Tagging gained popularity due to the growth of [[social bookmarking]], [[image sharing]], and [[social networking]] websites.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt; These sites allow users to create and manage labels (or "tags") that categorize content using simple keywords. Websites that include tags often display collections of tags as [[tag cloud]]s,&lt;ref name="Blogs"&gt;For example, [[Blogger]] and [[WordPress]] can display tag clouds.&lt;/ref&gt; as do some desktop applications.&lt;ref name="DesktopTagCloud"&gt;For example: Leap is a [[macOS]] application that features a clickable tag cloud of macOS tags: {{cite web |last=Hampton-Smith |first=Sam |date=12 April 2013 |title=The pro designer's guide to photo organization |url=http://www.creativebloq.com/design-tools/organising-your-images-4132310 |website=creativebloq.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416012408/http://www.creativebloq.com/design-tools/organising-your-images-4132310 |archivedate=16 April 2013 |quote=As with all the other options here, meta data can be added to individual files to help improve their find-ability, and uniquely the tag cloud field within Leap's interface allows you to quickly drill down to individually labelled files without fuss.}} TaggTool is a [[Windows]] application that permits tagging files and displaying a tag cloud: {{cite web |last=Henry |first=Alan |date=28 April 2010 |title=TaggTool: organize your files by keyword |url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/270236-taggtool-organize-your-files-by-keyword |website=pcmag.com |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711002811/http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/270236-taggtool-organize-your-files-by-keyword |archivedate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On websites that aggregate the tags of all users, an individual user's tags can be useful both to them and to the larger community of the website's users.

Tagging systems have sometimes been classified into two kinds: ''top-down'' and ''bottom-up''.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|142}}&lt;ref name="JonesHafner2012"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Top-down [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] are created by an authorized group of designers (sometimes in the form of a [[controlled vocabulary]]), whereas bottom-up taxonomies (called [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]]) are created by all users.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|142}} This definition of "top down" and "bottom up" should not be confused with the distinction between a ''single hierarchical'' [[tree structure]] (in which there is one correct way to classify each item) versus ''multiple non-hierarchical'' [[Set (abstract data type)|set]]s (in which there are multiple ways to classify an item); the structure of both top-down and bottom-up taxonomies may be either hierarchical, non-hierarchical, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|142–143}} Some researchers and applications have experimented with combining hierarchical and non-hierarchical tagging to aid in information retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Heymann |first1=Paul |last2=Garcia-Molina |first2=Hector |date=2006 |title=Collaborative creation of communal hierarchical taxonomies in social tagging systems |institution=[[Stanford University]] |url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu/775/}} Summarized in: {{cite web |last=Heymann |first=Paul |date=2006 |title=Tag hierarchies |url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~heymann/taghierarchy.html |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625094513/http://infolab.stanford.edu/~heymann/taghierarchy.html |website=infolab.stanford.edu |archivedate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quintarelli |first1=Emanuele |last2=Resmini |first2=Andrea |last3=Rosati |first3=Luca |date=June 2007 |title=Information architecture: Facetag: integrating bottom-up and top-down classification in a social tagging system |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=10–15 |doi=10.1002/bult.2007.1720330506 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2007.1720330506/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Harris |last2=Zubair |first2=Mohammad |last3=Maly |first3=Kurt |date=2007 |chapter=Collaborative classification of growing collections with evolving facets |title=Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on hypertext and hypermedia, Manchester, UK, September 10–12, 2007 |series=HT '07 |location=New York |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |pages=167–170 |isbn=9781595938206 |doi=10.1145/1286240.1286289 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1286289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are combining top-down and bottom-up tagging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carcillo |first1=Franco |last2=Rosati |first2=Luca |date=2007 |chapter=Tags for citizens: integrating top-down and bottom-up classification in the Turin municipality website |editor-last=Schuler |editor-first=Douglas |title=Online communities and social computing: second international conference, OCSC 2007, held as part of HCI International 2007, Beijing, China, July 22–27, 2007: proceedings |volume=4564 |location=Berlin; New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=256–264 |isbn=9783540732563 |oclc=184906067 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-73257-0_29}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in some large library catalogs ([[Online public access catalog|OPAC]]s) such as [[WorldCat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Katie |date=2007 |title=OPAC 2.0: next generation online library catalogues ride the Web 2.0 wave! |journal=Online Currents |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=406–413 |url=https://works.bepress.com/katie_wilson/14/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yee |first=Raymond |date=2008 |chapter=Understanding tagging and folksonomies |title=Pro Web 2.0 mashups: remixing data and Web services |series=The expert's voice in Web development |location=Berkeley |publisher=[[Apress]] |pages=61–75 |isbn=9781590598580 |oclc=148910044 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4302-0286-8_3 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGdLbRZ5AX0C&amp;pg=PA61}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Willey |first=Eric |date=2011 |title=A cautious partnership: the growing acceptance of folksonomy as a complement to indexing digital images and catalogs |url=http://ir.library.illinoisstate.edu/fpml/57/ |publisher=Library Student Journal |website=illinoisstate.edu |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerolimos |first=Michalis |date=January 2013 |title=Tagging for libraries: a review of the effectiveness of tagging systems for library catalogs |journal=Journal of Library Metadata |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=36–58 |doi=10.1080/19386389.2013.778730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tags or other taxonomies have further properties (or [[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]) such as [[Relation (philosophy)|relationship]]s and [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]s, they constitute an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]].&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|56–62}}

Metadata tags as described in this article should not be confused with the use of the word "tag" in some software to refer to an automatically generated [[cross-reference]]; examples of the latter are ''tags tables'' in [[Emacs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raman |first=T.

==History==
The use of keywords as part of an identification and classification system long predates computers. [[Paper data storage]] devices, notably [[edge-notched card]]s, that permitted classification and sorting by multiple criteria were already in use prior to the twentieth century, and [[faceted classification]] has been used by libraries since the 1930s.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[Unix]] [[text editor]] [[Emacs]] offered a companion software program called ''Tags'' that could automatically build a table of cross-references called a ''tags table'' that Emacs could use to jump between a [[function call]] and that function's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyrowitz |first1=Norman |last2=Dam |first2=Andries |date=September 1982 |title=Interactive Editing Systems: Part II |journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]] (CSUR) |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=353–415 (366–367) |doi=10.1145/356887.356890 |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/356887.356890 |quote=EMACS is an M.I.T. display editor designed to be 'extensible, customizable, and self-documenting' [...] Another interesting facility for program editing is the TAGS package. The separate program TAGS builds a TAGS table containing the file name and position in that file in which each application program function is defined. This table is loaded into EMACS; specifying the command Meta, ''function name'' causes EMACS to select the appropriate file and go to the proper function definition within that file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the word "tag" did not refer to metadata tags, but was an early use of the word "tag" in software to refer to a [[Index (publishing)|word index]].

[[Online database]]s and early websites deployed keyword tags as a way for publishers to help users find content. In the early days of the [[World Wide Web]], the &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt; [[meta element]] was used by [[web designer]]s to tell [[web search engine]]s what the web page was about, but these keywords were only visible in a web page's [[source code]] and were not modifiable by users.

[[File:A Description of the Equator and Some Otherlands, collaborative hypercinema portal Upload page.jpg|thumb|"A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands", collaborative hypercinema portal, produced by documenta X, 1997. User upload page associating user contributed media with the term ''Tag''.]] In 1997, the collaborative portal "A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands" produced by [[documenta]] X, Germany, used the [[Folksonomy|folksonomic]] term ''Tag'' for its co-authors and guest authors on its Upload page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands |url=http://aporee.org/equator/ |website=aporee.org |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010818013629/http://aporee.org/equator/ |archivedate=18 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Equator" the term ''Tag'' for user-input was described as an ''abstract literal or keyword'' to aid the user. However, users defined singular ''Tags'', and did not share ''Tags'' at that point.

In 2003, the [[social bookmarking]] website [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]] provided a way for its users to add "tags" to their bookmarks (as a way to help find them later);&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt;{{rp|162}} Delicious also provided browseable aggregated views of the bookmarks of all users featuring a particular tag.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshu/765809051/in/set-72157600740166824/ Screenshot of tags on del.icio.us] in 2004 and [https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshu/765817375/in/set-72157600740166824/ Screenshot of a tag page on del.icio.us], also in 2004, both published by [[Joshua Schachter]] on July 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of years, the [[photo sharing]] website [[Flickr]] allowed its users to add their own text tags to each of their pictures, constructing flexible and easy metadata that made the pictures highly searchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Garrett |first=Jesse James |date=4 August 2005 |title=An Interview with Flickr's Eric Costello |url=http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/e000519/ |quote=Tags were not in the initial version of Flickr. Stewart Butterfield wanted to add them. He liked the way they worked on del.icio.us, the social bookmarking application. We added very simple tagging functionality, so you could tag your photos, and then look at all your photos with a particular tag, or any one person's photos with a particular tag. Soon thereafter, users started telling us that what was really interesting about tagging was not just how you've tagged your photos, but how the whole Flickr community has been tagging photos. So we started seeing a lot of requests from users to be able to see a global view of the tagscape.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Flickr and the influence of Delicious popularized the concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mathes |first=Adam |date=December 2004 |title=Folksonomies: cooperative classification and communication through shared metadata |url=http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html |website=adammathes.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309071911/http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html |archivedate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[social software]] websites—such as [[YouTube]], [[Technorati]], and [[Last.fm]]—also implemented tagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=Manish |last2=Li |first2=Rui |last3=Yin |first3=Zhijun |last4=Han |first4=Jiawei |date=2011 |chapter=An overview of social tagging and applications |editor-last=Aggarwal |editor-first=Charu C. |title=Social network data analytics |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=447–497 |isbn=9781441984616 |oclc=709712928 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-8462-3_16 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=SE2iRgeYYwcC&amp;pg=PA446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] [[web syndication]] standard provided a "category" element for inserting subject categories into [[web feed]]s, and in 2007 [[Tim Bray]] proposed a "tag" [[Uniform Resource Name|URN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bray |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Bray |date=1 February 2007 |title=A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for tag metadata |url=https://www.tbray.org/tmp/tag-urn.html |website=tbray.org |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105032324/http://www.tbray.org/tmp/tag-urn.html |archivedate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Within a blog===
Many [[blog]] systems (and other web [[content management system]]s) allow authors to add free-form tags to a post, along with (or instead of) placing the post into a predetermined category.&lt;ref name="Blogs"/&gt; For example, a post may display that it has been tagged with &lt;code&gt;baseball&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tickets&lt;/code&gt;. Each of those tags is usually a [[web link]] leading to an index page listing all of the posts associated with that tag. The blog may have a sidebar listing all the tags in use on that blog, with each tag leading to an index page. To reclassify a post, an author edits its list of tags. All connections between posts are automatically tracked and updated by the blog software; there is no need to relocate the page within a complex hierarchy of categories.

===Within application software===
{{See also|Tag editor|Comparison of metadata editors}}
Some [[desktop application]]s and [[web application]]s feature their own tagging systems, such as email tagging in [[Gmail]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird]],&lt;ref name="Yee"/&gt;{{rp|73}} bookmark tagging in [[Firefox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Firefox tip: find bookmarks faster with tags |url=https://blog.mozilla.org/theden/2013/08/26/firefox-tip-find-bookmarks-faster-with-tags/ |website=blog.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012154755/https://blog.mozilla.org/theden/2013/08/26/firefox-tip-find-bookmarks-faster-with-tags/ |archivedate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; audio tagging in [[iTunes]] or [[Winamp]], and photo tagging in various applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinton |first1=Mark Justice |last2=Obermeier |first2=Barbara |last3=Sahlin |first3=Doug |date=2010 |chapter=Tagging photos |title=Editing digital photos for dummies |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470591451 |oclc=606841528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these applications display collections of tags as [[tag cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="DesktopTagCloud"/&gt;

===Assigned to computer files===
There are various systems for applying tags to the files in a computer's [[file system]]. In [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]], the operating system has allowed users to assign multiple arbitrary tags as [[extended file attributes]] to any file or folder ever since [[OS X 10.9]] was released in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siracusa |first=John |date=22 October 2013 |title=OS X 10.9 Mavericks: The Ars Technica Review: Tags |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/8/ |website=arstechnica.com |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=10 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109052357/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/8/ |archivedate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before that time the [[open-source]] OpenMeta standard provided similar tagging functionality in macOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherp |first=Aleh |date=17 March 2011 |title=Tagging |url=https://macademic.org/2011/03/17/tagging/ |website=macademic.org |publisher=Academic workflows on a Mac |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430074346/http://macademic.org/2011/03/17/tagging/ |archivedate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[semantic file system]]s that implement tags are available for the [[Linux kernel]], including [[Tagsistant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Extended attributes and tag file systems |date=2 July 2015 |url=https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/tagfs.html |website=lesbonscomptes.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811104645/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/tagfs.html |archivedate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] allows users to set tags only on [[Microsoft Office]] documents and some kinds of picture files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schultz |first=Greg |date=23 March 2011 |title=Tag your files for easier searches in Windows 7 |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/tag-your-files-for-easier-searches-in-windows-7/ |website=techrepublic.com |publisher=[[TechRepublic]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829073706/http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/tag-your-files-for-easier-searches-in-windows-7/ |archivedate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-platform]] file tagging standards include [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP), an [[List of International Organization for Standardization standards|ISO standard]] for embedding metadata into popular image, video and document file formats, such as [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], without breaking their readability by applications that do not support XMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gasiorowski-Denis |first=Elizabeth |date=22 March 2012 |title=Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) becomes an ISO standard |url=https://www.iso.org/news/2012/03/Ref1525.html |website=iso.org |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310223841/https://www.iso.org/news/2012/03/Ref1525.html |archivedate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; XMP largely supersedes the earlier [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]]. [[Exif]] is a standard that specifies the image and audio [[file format]]s used by [[digital camera]]s, including some metadata tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Płoszajski |first=Grzegorz |date=2017 |chapter=Metadata in long-term digital preservation |editor1-last=Traczyk |editor1-first=Tomasz |editor2-last=Ogryczak |editor2-first=Włodzimierz |editor3-last=Pałka |editor3-first=Piotr |editor4-last=Śliwiński |editor4-first=Tomasz |title=Digital preservation: putting it to work |series=Studies in computational intelligence |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=15–61 |isbn=9783319518008 |oclc=969844731 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-51801-5_2 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJrlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TagSpaces]] is an open-source cross-platform application for tagging files; it inserts tags into the [[filename]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Devcic |first=Ivana Isadora |date=9 October 2015 |title=Tag, you're it! How to manage files on Linux with TagSpaces |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tag-youre-manage-files-linux-tagspaces/ |website=makeuseof.com |publisher=[[MakeUseOf]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228100443/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tag-youre-manage-files-linux-tagspaces/ |archivedate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For an event===
An ''official tag'' is a keyword adopted by events and conferences for participants to use in their web publications, such as blog entries, photos of the event, and presentation slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finch |first=Curt |date=26 May 2011 |title=Hashtag techniques for businesses |url=http://www.inc.com/tech-blog/twitter-hashtag-techniques-for-businesses.html |website=inc.com |publisher=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Magazine]] |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Search engines can then index them to make relevant materials related to the event searchable in a uniform way. In this case, the tag is part of a [[controlled vocabulary]].

===In research===
A researcher may work with a large collection of items (e.g. press quotes, a bibliography, images) in digital form. If he/she wishes to associate each with a small number of themes (e.g. to chapters of a book, or to sub-themes of the overall subject), then a group of tags for these themes can be attached to each of the items in the larger collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parry |first=David |date=11 March 2007 |title=Tagging files—or how to keep research organized |url=http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2007/tagging-filesor-how-to-keep-research-organized/ |website=academhack.outsidethetext.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802081239/http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2007/tagging-filesor-how-to-keep-research-organized/ |archivedate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, freeform [[Categorization|classification]] allows the author to manage what would otherwise be unwieldy amounts of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Richard |date=December 2010 |title=Strategies for coping with information overload |journal=[[The BMJ]] |volume=341 |pages=c7126 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c7126 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c7126 |pmid=21159764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special types==

===Triple tags===
{{see also|Microformat}}
A '''triple tag''' or '''machine tag''' uses a special [[syntax]] to define extra [[semantic]] information about the tag, making it easier or more meaningful for interpretation by a computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bainbridge |first1=Scott |last2=Page |first2=Geoff |last3=Jaroensutasinee |first3=Mullica |last4=Jaroensutasinee |first4=Krisanadej |date=September 2011 |chapter=Towards a services based architecture for real time marine observing data |title=OCEANS '11 MTS/IEEE Kona, Waikoloa, Hawaii, USA, 19–22 22 September 2011 |location=Piscataway, NJ |publisher=[[IEEE]] |pages=740–745 |isbn=9781457714276 |oclc=777270556 |chapterurl=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6106990/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple tags comprise three parts: a [[namespace]], a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]], and a value. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;geo:long=50.123456&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a tag for the geographical [[longitude]] coordinate whose value is 50.123456. This triple structure is similar to the [[Resource Description Framework]] model for information.

The triple tag format was first devised for geolicious in November 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maron |first=Mikel |date=5 November 2004 |title=geo.lici.us: geotagging hosted services |url=http://brainoff.com/weblog/2004/11/05/124 |website=brainoff.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428042415/http://brainoff.com/weblog/2004/11/05/124 |archivedate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to map [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]] bookmarks, and gained wider acceptance after its adoption by Mappr and GeoBloggers to map [[Flickr]] photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Catt |first=Dan |date=11 January 2006 |title=Advanced Tagging and TripleTags |url=http://geobloggers.com/archives/2006/01/11/advanced-tagging-and-tripletags/ |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024028/http://geobloggers.com/archives/2006/01/11/advanced-tagging-and-tripletags/ |archivedate=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Aaron Straup Cope at Flickr introduced the term ''machine tag'' as an alternative name for the triple tag, adding some questions and answers on purpose, syntax, and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straup Cope |first=Aaron |date=24 January 2007 |title=Machine tags |url=https://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/ |website=flickr.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420154054/https://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/ |archivedate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized metadata for geographical identification is known as ''[[geotagging]]''; machine tags are also used for other purposes, such as identifying photos taken at a specific event or naming species using [[binomial nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Encyclopedia of Life Flickr group rules |url=https://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life/rules/ |website=flickr.com |publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Life]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210051254/https://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life/rules/ |archivedate=10 February 2017}} Includes the required use of a taxonomy machine tag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hashtags===
{{main|Hashtag}}
A hashtag is a kind of metadata tag marked by the prefix &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes known as a "hash" symbol. This form of tagging is used on [[microblogging]] and [[social networking service]]s such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], [[VK (social network)|VK]] and [[Instagram]].

===Knowledge tags===
{{See also|Knowledge base|Knowledge representation|Personal knowledge base}}
A '''knowledge tag''' is a type of [[metadata|meta-information]] that describes or defines some aspect of a piece of information (such as a [[document]], [[digital image]], [[database table]], or [[web page]]).&lt;ref name="Panda-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panda |first1=Mrutyunjaya |last2=El-Bendary |first2=Nashwa |last3=Salama |first3=Mostafa A. |last4=Hassanien |first4=Aboul Ella |last5=Abraham |first5=Ajith |date=2012 |chapter=Computational social networks: tools, perspectives, and challenges |editor1-last=Abraham |editor1-first=Ajith |editor2-last=Hassanien |editor2-first=Aboul-Ella |title=Computational social networks: tools, perspectives, and applications |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=3–23 [14–15] |isbn=9781447140474 |oclc=798568503 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-4048-1_1 |chapterurl=http://www.softcomputing.net/csn12_chap1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge tags are more than traditional non-hierarchical [[Index term|keywords or terms]]; they are a type of [[metadata]] that captures knowledge in the form of descriptions, categorizations, classifications, [[semantics]], comments, notes, annotations, [[hyperdata]], [[hyperlinks]], or references that are collected in tag profiles (a kind of [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]).&lt;ref name="Panda-et-al-2012"/&gt; These tag profiles reference an information resource that resides in a distributed, and often heterogeneous, storage repository.&lt;ref name="Panda-et-al-2012"/&gt;

Knowledge tags are part of a [[knowledge management]] discipline that leverages [[Enterprise 2.0]] methodologies for users to capture insights, expertise, attributes, dependencies, or relationships associated with a data resource.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|251}}&lt;ref name="Wiig"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiig |first=Karl M. |date=March 1997 |title=Knowledge management: an introduction and perspective |journal=[[Journal of Knowledge Management]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6–14 |doi=10.1108/13673279710800682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different kinds of knowledge can be captured in knowledge tags, including factual knowledge (that found in books and data), conceptual knowledge (found in perspectives and concepts), expectational knowledge (needed to make judgments and hypothesis), and methodological knowledge (derived from reasoning and strategies).&lt;ref name="Wiig"/&gt; These forms of [[knowledge]] often exist outside the data itself and are derived from personal experience, insight, or expertise. Knowledge tags are considered an expansion of the information itself that adds additional value, context, and meaning to the information. Knowledge tags are valuable for preserving organizational intelligence that is often lost due to [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]], for sharing knowledge stored in the minds of individuals that is typically isolated and unharnessed by the organization, and for connecting knowledge that is often lost or disconnected from an information resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alavi |first1=Maryam |last2=Leidner |first2=Dorothy E. |date=February 1999 |title=Knowledge management systems: issues, challenges, and benefits |journal=Communications of the AIS |volume=1 |issue=2es |pages=1 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=374116.374117 |publisher=[[Association for Information Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
In a typical tagging system, there is no explicit information about the meaning or [[semantics]] of each tag, and a user can apply new tags to an item as easily as applying older tags.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt; Hierarchical classification systems can be slow to change, and are rooted in the culture and era that created them; in contrast, the flexibility of tagging allows users to classify their collections of items in the ways that they find useful, but the personalized variety of terms can present challenges when searching and browsing.

When users can freely choose tags (creating a [[folksonomy]], as opposed to selecting terms from a [[controlled vocabulary]]), the resulting metadata can include [[homonym]]s (the same tags used with different meanings) and [[synonym]]s (multiple tags for the same concept), which may lead to inappropriate connections between items and inefficient searches for information about a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Golder |first1=Scott A. |last2=Huberman |first2=Bernardo A. |date=April 2006 |title=Usage patterns of collaborative tagging systems |journal=[[Journal of Information Science]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=198–208 |doi=10.1177/0165551506062337}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tag "orange" may refer to the [[Orange (fruit)|fruit]] or the [[Orange (colour)|color]], and items related to a version of the [[Linux kernel]] may be tagged "Linux", "kernel", "Penguin", "software", or a variety of other terms. Users can also choose tags that are different [[inflection]]s of words (such as singular and plural),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Devens |first=Keith |date=24 December 2004 |title=Singular vs. plural tags in a tag-based categorization system (such as del.icio.us) |url=http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2004/Dec/24/SvP.tags |website=keithdevens.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510221217/http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2004/Dec/24/SvP.tags |archivedate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can contribute to navigation difficulties if the system does not include [[stemming]] of tags when searching or browsing. Larger-scale folksonomies address some of the problems of tagging, in that users of tagging systems tend to notice the current use of "tag terms" within these systems, and thus use existing tags in order to easily form connections to related items. In this way, folksonomies may collectively develop a partial set of tagging conventions.

===Complex system dynamics===
Despite the apparent lack of control, research has shown that a simple form of shared vocabulary emerges in social bookmarking systems. Collaborative tagging exhibits a form of [[complex system]]s dynamics (or [[Self-organization|self-organizing]] dynamics).&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Halpin |first1=Harry |last2=Robu |first2=Valentin |last3=Shepherd |first3=Hana |date=2007 |chapter=The complex dynamics of collaborative tagging |title=Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web, Banff, Alberta, Canada, May 08–12, 2007 |series=WWW '07 |location=New York |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |pages=211–220 |isbn=9781595936547 |oclc=173331796 |doi=10.1145/1242572.1242602 |chapterurl=http://www2007.org/papers/paper635.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if no central controlled vocabulary constrains the actions of individual users, the distribution of tags converges over time to stable [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref"/&gt; Once such stable distributions form, simple [[Folksonomy|folksonomic]] vocabularies can be extracted by examining the [[correlation]]s that form between different tags. In addition, research has suggested that it is easier for [[machine learning]] algorithms to learn tag semantics when users tag "verbosely"—when they annotate resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Körner |first1=Christian |last2=Benz |first2=Dominik |last3=Hotho |first3=Andreas |last4=Strohmaier |first4=Markus |last5=Stumme |first5=Gerd |date=2010 |chapter=Stop thinking, start tagging: tag semantics emerge from collaborative verbosity |title=Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, April 26–30, 2010 |series=WWW '10 |location=New York |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |pages=521–530 |isbn=9781605587998 |oclc=671101543 |doi=10.1145/1772690.1772744 |chapterurl=http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2010/www/p521.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spamming===
Tagging systems open to the public are also open to tag spam, in which people apply an excessive number of tags or unrelated tags to an item (such as a [[YouTube]] video) in order to attract viewers. This abuse can be mitigated using human or statistical identification of spam items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Heymann |first=Paul |title=Tag spam |url=http://heymann.stanford.edu/tagspam.html |website=stanford.edu |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tags allowed may also be limited to reduce spam.

==Syntax==
Some tagging systems provide a single [[text box]] to enter tags, so to be able to [[tokenize]] the string, a [[Wiktionary:separator|separator]] must be used. Two popular separators are the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]] and the [[comma]]. To enable the use of separators in the tags, a system may allow for higher-level separators (such as [[quotation mark]]s) or [[escape character]]s. Systems can avoid the use of separators by allowing only one tag to be added to each input [[Web widget|widget]] at a time, although this makes adding multiple tags more time-consuming.

A syntax for use within [[HTML]] is to use the '''rel-tag''' [[microformat]] which uses the [[Rel attribute|''rel'' attribute]] with value "tag" (i.e., &lt;code&gt;rel="tag"&lt;/code&gt;) to indicate that the linked-to page acts as a tag for the current context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microformats wiki: rel='tag' |url=http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag |website=microformats.org |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{selfref|For Wikipedia's policy on the use of tertiary sources, see [[WP:TERTIARY]].}}
{{Distinguish|Tertiary sector}}
A '''tertiary source''' is an index or textual consolidation of [[Primary source|primary]] and [[secondary source]]s.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/genedinfolit/1infobasics/tertiary_information_sources.html|title=Tertiary Information Sources|date=September 2012|publisher=Old Dominion University -- ODU Libraries|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/tertiary Tertiary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tertiary sources are not to be used for academic [[research]], unless they can also be used as secondary sources, or to find other sources.&lt;ref name=newhaven&gt;"[http://libguides.newhaven.edu/content.php?pid=465151&amp;sid=3809011 Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Resources]". University of New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap with secondary sources==
Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a [[bibliography]], [[dictionary]], or [[encyclopedia]] as either a tertiary or a secondary source.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt; This causes difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.

In some [[academic discipline]]s the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative.&lt;ref name="umd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU /&gt; 

In the [[UNISIST model|United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model]], a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Søndergaard | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Andersen | first2 = J. | last3 = Hjørland | first3 = B. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310472509 | title = Documents and the communication of scientific and scholarly information: Revising and updating the UNISIST model | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 278 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tertiary sources==
As tertiary sources, encyclopedias, [[textbook]]s, and [[compendium|compendia]] attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview, but may also present subjective, or biased commentary and analysis (which are characteristics of secondary sources).

[[Bibliographic index|Indexes]], bibliographies, [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], and [[Database#Research|databases]] may not provide much textual information, but as aggregates of primary and secondary sources, they are often considered tertiary sources. So although tertiary sources are both primary and secondary, they are more towards a secondary source because of commentary and bias.

[[Almanac]]s, [[guide book|travel guides]], [[field guide]]s, and [[timeline]]s are also examples of tertiary sources.

Survey or overview articles are usually tertiary, though [[review articles]] in peer-reviewed [[academic journals]] are secondary (not be confused with film, book, etc. [[review]]s, which are primary-source opinions).

Some usually primary sources, such as [[User guide|user guides and manuals]], are secondary or tertiary (depending on the nature of the material) when written by third parties.

'''Text Annotation''' is the practice and the result of adding a note or [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and [[Collaborative editing|editing]], commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text.&lt;ref name= "Shabjee and Reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabajee|first=P. and D. Reynolds|title=What is Annotation? A Short Review of Annotation and Annotation Systems|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/publications/researchreport/rr1053/report_html?ilrtyear=2003|work=ILRT Research Report No. 1053|publisher=Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Text annotations are sometimes referred to as [[marginalia]], though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.

This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also [[Web annotation]].

== History ==

Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in [[Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe,|first=Joanna|author2=Christine M. Neuwirth |title=From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|year=2001|volume=15|issue=33|pages=333–370|doi=10.1177/105065190101500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[printing press]] and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or [[Footnotes|textual footnotes or endnotes]] rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, [[learning]], social [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[editing]], and other practices.  Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and [[Computer data storage|storage]] that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds"/&gt;

== Functions and Applications ==

Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks," which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers," which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages," for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function.&lt;ref name = "Wolfe and Neuwirth"/&gt; Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, [[motivation]], and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support [[memory]] and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Catherine|title=Reading and Writing the Electronic Book|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=UNC Chapel Hill|pages=38–51|url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009|doi=10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational applications ===

Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and [[communication]]. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for [[collaborative learning]], both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Effects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Effects of Annotations on Student Readers and Writers|journal=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries|year=2000|pages=19–26|doi=10.1145/336597.336620|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336620|isbn=158113231X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of [[critical reading]] and stance-taking necessary for effective [[Argumentation|argumentative writing]].&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib" /&gt;

While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, "since the 1920s, [[literacy]] theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders /&gt;  Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Nancy|author2=Yoram Chisik |title=In the Company of Readers: The Digital Library Book as "Practiced Place"|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries|year=2005|pages=235–243|doi=10.1145/1065385.1065439|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065439|isbn=1581138768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.&lt;ref name=GunaTanKauferEncouragingReadingandCollaboration&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=Ananda|author2=Aaron Tan |author3=David Kaufer |title=Encouraging Reading and Collaboration Using Classroom Salon|journal=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education|year=2010|pages=254–258|doi=10.1145/1822090.1822162|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=90744943&amp;CFTOKEN=38262707|isbn=9781605587295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, [[critical thinking]], and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall et all Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple Perspectives on Problem Solving and Learning in the Digital Age.|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=313–323|author=Mendenhall, A. |author2=C. Kim |author3=T.E. Johson|editor=D. Ifenthaler |editor2=P. Isaias |editor3=J.M. Spector |editor4=K. D.G. Sampson|chapter=Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool in a College English Course.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them [[English studies|English]], [[sport psychology]], and [[hypermedia]]. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, [[metacognition]], and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.&lt;ref name="Novak et al Educaitonal Uses of Social Annotation Tools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Elena |author2=Rim Razzouk |author3=Tristan E. Johnson|title=The Educational Uses of Social Annotation Tools in Higher Education: A Literature Review|journal=Internet and Higher Education|year=2012|volume=15|pages=39–49|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ947876&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ947876|doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and text-centered collaboration ===

Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called "queries").&lt;ref name=Einsohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Einsohn|first=Emily|title=The Copyeditor's Handbook|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_copyeditor_s_handbook.html?id=qv1p2RYbpY0C|isbn=9780520218352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks.&lt;ref name="Weng and Gennari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chuhnua|author2=John H. Gennari |title=Asynchronous Collaborative Writing Through Annotations|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work '04|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=578–581|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031705|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031607.1031705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of [[computer-supported cooperative work]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez and Eklundh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Henry|author2=Kerstin Severinson Eklundh |title=Visualizing Patterns of Annotation in Document-Centered Collaboration on the Web|journal=Studies in Writing: Vol. 17 Writing and Digital Media|year=2005|pages=131–143|editor1-first=L. |editor1-last=Van Waes |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Leijten |editor3-first=C. |editor3-last=Neuwirth |others=G. Rijlaardsdam (Series Ed.)|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and Design ==

Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.

===Annotation structure===
The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a ''body'', an ''anchor'', and a ''marker''. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated [[symbols]] and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook /&gt;

===Annotation display types===
IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:
* Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text
* Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a "sidebar" layer
* Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text
* Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text
* Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document
* Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen
Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe Annotation Technologies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotation Technologies: A software and Research Review|journal=Computers and Composition|year=2002|volume=19|issue=4|pages=471–497|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(02)00144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as ''anchored discussion''.&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotations and the Collaborative Digital Library: Effects of an Aligned Annotion Interface on Student Argumentation and Reading Strategies|journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|date=Jun 2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–164|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ851577&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ851577|doi=10.1007/s11412-008-9040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT-based text annotation systems ==

IT-based annotation systems include [[Computer software|standalone]] and [[Client-server model|client-server systems]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of [[Library|libraries]], [[patent office]]s, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of annotation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine C.: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263806 Annotation: from paper books to the digital library], Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto]] and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Bibliothèque de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).

Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] Writer and [[Microsoft Word]]. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as [[Adobe Acrobat]], which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds" /&gt;

=== Web-based text annotation systems ===
{{main|Web annotation}}
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] had already implemented the concept&lt;ref name="boulton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archaeology.org/the-nexus-browser/|title=The Nexus Browser|last=Boulton|first=Jim|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of directly editing web documents in 1990 in [[WorldWideWeb]], the first web browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=21 September 2014|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability.&lt;ref name="boulton"/&gt; An early version of [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]] in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability,&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkdroid.org/tmp/www-talk/1192.html|title=Group Annotation Server Guinea Pigs?|last=Andreessen|first=Marc|date=31 May 1993|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was quickly removed.  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, [[WebDAV]], was then reintroduced as an extension.

A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document.  This approach was pioneered by [[Stet (software)|Stet]], the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]]. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The [[co-ment]] system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using [[Django (web framework)|Django]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]] on the server side and various [[AJAX]] libraries such as [[JQuery]] on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU [[Affero General Public License]].

Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin|first=Kenneth|title=IRS Determination Letter|url=https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has offered the free, open web annotation service [[Hypothes.is]]. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a [[Learning management system|LMS]] or [[Content management system|CMS]]. Both [[Web annotation|webpages]] and [[Portable Document Format#Annotation|PDFs]] can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, [http://www.hylighter.com/hybar/site/index.html HyLighter] supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] tasks as [[Named-entity recognition]], relationship extraction or [[Canonicalization|normalization]]. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via [[supervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cejuela|first=Juan Miguel|title=tagtog, interactive and text-mining-assisted annotation of gene mentions in PLOS full-text articles|pmc=3978375|publisher=[[Database (journal)|Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation]]|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal [[PLoS ONE]], published by the [[Public Library of Science]], has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.

:''The Map Library should not be confused with the [[Map Library]] of [[The British Museum]].''

'''''The Map Library''''' is a project of '''The Map Maker Trust''' [[Charitable organization|charity]], and supported by '''Map Maker Ltd.''', for the supplying of free [[GIS]] data. The project website also hosts free conversion software for [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] files. As of November 2008, the only data sets available were for the continents of [[Africa]] and [[Central America]].

== Statement of purpose ==
From the website...

:''The idea behind the Map Library is that the lack of good, simple maps is a serious obstacle to development in all kinds of fields, from health care to urban management, from de-mining to environmental protection. The library's purpose is two fold: to make public domain mapping data more readily available for developing countries, and to provide free, easy to use software to facilitate map making by non-experts. The Map Library delivers data and software both on the internet and by post on CD for those with poor or no internet access.''

== Data format and conversion ==
The project data is managed in part by two pieces of software, each supporting different file formats and conversions.

* '''''Raster Converter''''' handles [[ECW (file format)|ECW]] files: these can be converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[TIFF]], and with external libraries, [[JPEG]], and [[JPEG 2000]].
* '''''Vector Converter''''' handles MLB ("map-library") files: these files can be converted to data files for [[ArcView]], [[AutoCAD]], and several other formats.

== Data sources ==
The project uses data from [[NASA]] mapping projects, [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]], and the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11159">A '''three-letter acronym''' ('''TLA'''), or '''three-letter abbreviation''', is an [[abbreviation]], specifically an [[Acronym|acronym, alphabetism, or initialism]], consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as ''etc.'' and ''Mrs.'' are not three-letter acronyms, but "TLA" {{em|itself}} is a TLA (an example of an [[Autological word|autological]] abbreviation).

Most three-letter abbreviations are ''initialisms'': all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in ''[[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|p|iː|ˈ|eɪ}} {{respell|AY|pee|AY|'}}. Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; [[computed axial tomography]], CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in "CAT scan".

==History and origins==

The exact phrase ''three-letter acronym'' appeared in the sociology literature in 1975.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. J. |last=Levy |title=Review of ''The Logic of Social Systems'' |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |year=1975 |jstor=2777655 |doi=10.1086/226119 |page=658 |quote=The acronyms DSE and DNA have something in common: each is a three-letter acronym.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-letter acronyms were used as [[mnemonic]]s in biological sciences, from 1977&lt;ref name=Seavey&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. R. |last=Seavey |first2=P. H. |last2=Raven |year=1977 |title=Chromosomal Differentiation and the Sources of the South American Species of ''Epilobium'' (Onagraceae) |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=57 | doi = 10.2307/3038128 |jstor=3038128 |quote=All taxa indicated by three-letter acronyms with strains indicated by a fourth letter if necessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. A. |last=Weber |year=1982 |title=Mnemonic Three-Letter Acronyms for the Families of Vascular Plants: A Device for More Effective Herbarium Curation |journal=Taxon |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |jstor=1220592 |doi=10.2307/1220592}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. D. |last=Nilsen |first2=A. P. |last2=Nilsen |year=1995 |title=Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language |journal=The English Journal |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=65–71 |jstor=820897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair [[ZX81]] home computer used and explained TLA.&lt;ref name=ZX81&gt;[[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steven Vickers]] ''ZX81 Basic Programming'', Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 "As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA)."&lt;/ref&gt; The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a [[JPL]] report of 1982.&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;[http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-70/70R.PDF TDA Progress Report] R. Hull (1982) An Introduction to the new Productivity Information Management System page 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in a paper titled "On the cruelty of really teaching computer science", eminent computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] wrote &lt;!-- disparagingly (see quote in context) --&gt;
"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA  ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html On the cruelty of really teaching computer science]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992 it was in a [[Microsoft]] handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gookin (1992) ''The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows'' page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinatorics==

The number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or [[permutations]]) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.

In [[English language|English]], [[WWW (disambiguation)|WWW]] is the longest possible TLA to [[Pronunciation of "www"|pronounce]], typically requiring nine [[syllable]]s. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the [[acronym]] instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, "www" is sometimes abbreviated as "dubdubdub" in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.brynmawr.edu/features/digispeak-a-glossary-of-the-new-lingo/|title=DigiSpeak: A Glossary of the New Lingo|date=May 2011|website=bryn mawr alumnae bulletin|publisher=Bryn Mawr College Alumnae Association|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5949">'''Tupper's self-referential formula''' is a [[formula]] that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (''x'', ''y'') plane.

== History ==

The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 [[SIGGRAPH]] paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/mooncake/papers/SIGGRAPH2001_Tupper.pdf Tupper, Jeff. "Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables"]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program developed by Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peda.com/grafeq/|title=Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the formula is called "[[self-reference|self-referential]]", Tupper did not name it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula Debunked |url=http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424181239/http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==

The formula is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} &lt; \left\lfloor \mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor {y \over 17} \right\rfloor 2^{-17 \lfloor x \rfloor - \mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor, 17)},2\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
or, as plaintext,
{{quotation|1/2 &lt; floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2))}}

where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], and mod is the [[modulo operation]].

Let ''k'' equal the following 543-digit integer:

{{quotation|960 939 379 918 958 884 971 672 962 127 852 754 715 004 339 660 129 306 651 505 519 271 702 802 395 266 424 689 642 842 174 350 718 121 267 153 782 770 623 355 993 237 280 874 144 307 891 325 963 941 337 723 487 857 735 749 823 926 629 715 517 173 716 995 165 232 890 538 221 612 403 238 855 866 184 013 235 585 136 048 828 693 337 902 491 454 229 288 667 081 096 184 496 091 705 183 454 067 827 731 551 705 405 381 627 380 967 602 565 625 016 981 482 083 418 783 163 849 115 590 225 610 003 652 351 370 343 874 461 848 378 737 238 198 224 849 863 465 033 159 410 054 974 700 593 138 339 226 497 249 461 751 545 728 366 702 369 745 461 014 655 997 933 798 537 483 143 786 841 806 593 422 227 898 388 722 980 000 748 404 719}}

If one [[Graph of a function|graphs]] the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') in 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;106 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored):

[[File:Tupper's self referential formula plot.svg]]
[[File:Tupper_formula_constant_derivation.svg|thumb|91px&lt;!-- 91px gives acceptable text rendering with least overshoot or ugly gaps --&gt;|Derivation of ''k'']]

The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant&amp;nbsp;''k'', and it could actually be used to draw any other image.  When applied to the unbounded positive range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps.  One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot3big.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot2.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot.png&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant ''k'' is a simple [[1-bit color|monochrome]] [[bitmap|bitmap image]] of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17.  If ''k'' is divided by 17, the [[least significant bit]] encodes the upper-right corner (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.
