'''''1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off''''' is the sixth in a series of books based on the intellectual British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', written by series-creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], director of research [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]], and chief researcher James Harkin. Published on 1 November 2012 (9 September 2013 in the US), it is a [[trivia]] book containing 1,227 facts collected during the making of the series, which had been ten years in the making at the time of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/buy/3062/1227_qi_facts_to_blow_your_socks_off_book/|title=1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off (Book)|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Lloyd said in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': "This book is like a set of [[haiku]]. I think it's the best thing we've ever done. It has purity and simplicity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garner|first=Lesley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/9640410/John-Lloyd-Creating-QI-brought-me-out-of-depression.html|title=John Lloyd: Creating QI brought me out of depression|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The book contains lists of facts, normally four per page. All the sources for the facts are listed online on the QI website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=John|authorlink=John Lloyd (writer)|author2=[[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] |author3=Harkin, James|title=1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|date=1 November 2012|pages=310|isbn=978-0-571-29791-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Lloyd, Mitchinson and Harkin, credit for authorship is also given to ''QI'' researchers (also known as "Elves") Anne Miller, Andy Murray and Alex Bell.

The reason for the number of facts being 1,227, according to Lloyd and Mitchinson, was that they had originally planned to have 1,000 facts and when they wrote down the list containing all the facts that would go in the book, they discovered that they had gone past the number, to 1,227.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = BBC Breakfast, 6 November, 2012 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q652 | series = BBC Breakfast | serieslink = BBC Breakfast | credits = [[Charlie Stayt|Stayt, Charlie]]; [[Susanna Reid|Reid, Susanna]]; [[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, John]]; [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Two]] |location= [[Manchester]] | airdate = 6 November 2012 | minutes = 7:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AS3959''' is an [[Australian]] Standard for [[construction]] of homes in [[bushfire]] prone zones. The latest version AS3959:2009 was hurried into release after the devastation of "[[Black Saturday bushfires|Black Saturday]]" bushfires, which killed 173 people and destroyed over 2,000 homes.

The latest release of AS3959 has significant changes, bringing major changes to construction of homes to be built in the future. Under this new standard all proposed building requires the [[Real estate developer|builder]] or [[landowner]] to undergo a BAL (Bushfire Attack Level) Assessment. This requires a report tabled to establish the threat of bushfire on this future proposed dwelling. The report takes in matters such as the area FDI (Fire Danger Index), the blocks ground slope, [[vegetation]] type and density to determine the intensity of fire attack, split into 6 levels. The six levels relate to the intensity of [[Radiant heat|Radiant Heat]] exposure, with the levels being BAL-LOW (no threat or construction changes needed), BAL-12.5 (Radiant Heat levels would calculate 12.5&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), BAL-19 (19&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), BAL-29 (29&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), BAL-40 (40&amp;nbsp;kW/m²) and BAL-FZ (Flame Zone, which can be as high as 100&amp;nbsp;kW/m²).
AS3959:2009 therefore instructs what changes and test methods are required for construction to comply to the BAL Assessed levels.
AS3959:2009 from 1 May 2010 has been adopted as part of the BCA (Building Code Of Australia).

Copies of Australian Standards such as AS3959 are available from SAI Global, or see organisations such as the Victorian Building Authority, Victorian Country Fire Authority or the NSW Rural Fire Service for further information and guidelines on this subject.

The '''''Auctoritates Aristotelis''''' ("Authoritative [passages of] [[Aristotle]]") was a popular [[florilegium]] (anthology of brief extracts) composed around the end of the thirteenth century by the [[Franciscan]] scholar [[Johannes de Fonte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamesse 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of ''sententiae'' (opinions) derived from [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] texts was compiled around 1300 by de Fonte while he was a lector in theology at the Franciscan convent in [[Montpellier]]. He says in the prologue that his work is intended to provide assistance “as much for preaching to the people as study of the arts.” The work enjoyed a wide circulation,  providing a convenient way to access Aristotle's philosophy, or to embellish a composition or sermon with quotations from his work.

The '''Beach Volleyball Database''' is an online [[website]] that holds extensive information about international [[beach volleyball]] players, tournaments and history. News are frequently updated, and the site has results for [[continent]]al and [[international]] tournaments. It is the only website of its kind in the sport of beach volleyball.

The press operations officer for the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]], Tim Simmons, has said that the Beach Volleyball Database has had a major impact on the sport. Information that is now easily accessible through the website, used to take time consuming research through different sources. Now professional athletes have a chance to set long-term goals based on their long-term results in comparison to other professional beach volleyball players.&lt;ref name=keck&gt;Alan Keck, [http://www.bvbinfo.com/news.asp?ID=399 Beach Volleyball: Fan is a one-man, on-line encyclopedia on the sport], [[The Virginian Pilot]], 2002 (Beach Volleyball Database)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Volleyball Magazine'' calls the website "a reliable source for entries and results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://volleyballmag.com/avp-contract-042917/|title=Most AVP players acquiesce and sign contract, exclusivity agreement|date=April 29, 2017|first=Ed|last=Chan|work=Volleyball Magazine|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also collaborates with the [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]] (FIVB) to provide tournament notes to the FIVB website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/BeachVolleyball/Document/2018_FIVB_BVB_Handbook_V1.pdf|title=FIVB 2018 Handbook Beach Volleyball|publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]]|date=February 20, 2018|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatrice Harraden''' (1864–1936) was a British writer and [[suffragette]].

==Life==
Born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]]&lt;ref name=Dickins&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickins|first=Gordon|title=An Illustrated Literary Guide to Shropshire|year=1987|publisher=Shropshire Libraries|page=35|isbn=0-903802-37-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 January 1864, Harraden studied in [[Dresden]], at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College|Cheltenham Ladies’ College]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and at [[Queen's College, London|Queen’s College]] and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] in London, and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]&lt;ref name=Dickins /&gt; degree. She travelled extensively in Europe and the United States and in 1893 found fame with her [[debut novel]], ''Ships That Pass in the Night'', a love story set in a [[tuberculosis]] [[sanatorium]].  It was a best-seller, but she failed to achieve similar success with subsequent books which included novels, short stories and books for children.&lt;ref name=Dickins /&gt;

Harraden spent several summer holidays lodging at The Green Dragon inn at [[Little Stretton, Shropshire]], walking and writing.  Her memories of this and the landlady, a Mrs Benbow, led to her writing a short story, ''At the Green Dragon'', published in 1894.&lt;ref name=Dickins /&gt;

Harraden involved herself  with the women's rights movement, joining the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], the [[Women Writers' Suffrage League]] and [[Women's Tax Resistance League|Women’s Tax Resistance League]] and publishing her work in the suffragette paper ''[[Votes for Women]]''. This involvement is reflected in much of her fiction. She also involved herself as a reader for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', and this, too is reflected in her fiction: ''The Scholar’s Daughter'' (1906) is set among [[lexicographer]]s.&lt;ref name="winchester"&gt;{{cite book

In 1930, she received a [[Pension#Civil list pensions|civil list pension]] for her literary work. She died at Barton-on-Sea on Monday 5 May 1936.

[[File:Etymological Relationships Tree.png|thumb|Diagram showing relationships between etymologically-related words]]

In [[linguistics]], '''cognates''' are [[word]]s that have a common [[etymology|etymological]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Crystal |editor-first=David |editorlink=David Crystal |date=2011 |title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |edition=6th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;pg=PT104 |chapter=cognate |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=104 |isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5 |oclc=899159900 |access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cognate etymon need not be inherited directly from a proto-language; the etymon can be borrowed from some other language, in which evolution produces cognate forms. For example, the [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:dish#English|dish]]'' and the [[German language|German]] word ''[[wikt:Tisch#German|Tisch]]'' ("table") are cognates because they both come from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:discus#Latin|discus]]'', which relates to their flat surfaces. Cognates may have evolved similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar letters in the word. Some words sound similar, but don't come from the same root; these are called false cognates.

In [[etymology]], the ''cognate'' category excludes [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and [[loanword]]s. The word ''cognate'' derives from the Latin noun ''[[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]]'', which means "blood relative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate "cognate"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed.: "Latin ''cognātus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gnātus'', born, past participle of ''nāscī'', to be born." Other definitions of the English word include "[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor" and "[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which [[semantic drift|may have changed]] as the languages developed separately. For example [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:starve#English|starve]]'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[wikt:sterven#Dutch|sterven]]'' or [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:sterben|sterben]]'' ("to die") all derive from the same [[Proto-Germanic]] root, ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sterbaną|*sterbaną]]'' ("die"). ''Discus'' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δίσκος'' (from the verb ''δικεῖν'' "to throw"). A later and separate English reflex of ''discus'', probably through [[medieval Latin]] ''desca'', is ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' (see [[OED]] s.v. ''desk'').

Cognates also do not need to have similar forms: English ''[[wikt:father|father]]'', [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:père#French|père]]'', and Armenian [[wikt:հայր|հայր]] (''hayr'') all descend directly from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ph₂tḗr''.

==Across languages==
Examples of cognates in [[Indo-European languages]] are the words ''night'' ([[English language|English]]), ''nuit'' ([[French language|French]]), ''noche'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''Nacht'' ([[German language|German]]), ''nacht'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''nag'' ([[Afrikaans]]), ''nicht'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''natt'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''nat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''nátt'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''nótt'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''noc'' ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]]), ночь, ''noch'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), ноќ, ''noć'' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), нощ, ''nosht'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''ніч'', ''nich'' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), ''ноч'', ''noch''/''noč'' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]), ''noč'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]), ''noć'' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]]), νύξ, ''nyx'' ([[Ancient Greek]], ''νύχτα''/''nychta'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''nox/nocte'' ([[Latin]]), ''nakt-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''natë'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''nos'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''nueche'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]), ''noite'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''notte'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''nit'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''nuèch/nuèit'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]), ''noapte'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''nakts'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''naktis'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]) and ''Naach'' ([[Colognian language|Colognian]]), all meaning "night" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/nókʷts|*nókʷts]]}} "night".

Another Indo-European example is ''star'' ([[English language|English]]), ''str-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''tara'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''tora'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), ''astre''/''étoile'' ([[French language|French]]), ''ἀστήρ (astēr)'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] or ''ἀστέρι''/''ἄστρο'', ''asteri''/''astro'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''astro/stella'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''aster'' ([[Latin]]) ''stea'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), ''stairno'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]), ''astgh'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), ''Stern'' ([[German language|German]]), ''ster'' (Dutch and [[Afrikaans]]), ''Schtähn'' ([[Colognian language|Colognian]]), ''starn'' (Scots), ''stjerne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and Danish), ''stjarna'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''stjärna'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''stjørna'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''setāre'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]), ''stoorei'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]), ''seren'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''steren'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''estel'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''estela'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) ''estrella'' and ''astro'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''estrella'' [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], ''estrela'' and ''astro'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) and ''estêre'' or ''stêrk'' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂stḗr|*h₂stḗr]]}} "star".

The [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|سلام}} ''salām'', the [[Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|שלום}} ''shalom'', the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] ''shlama'' and the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''selam'' ("peace") are also cognates, derived from the [[Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/šalām-|*šalām-]] "peace".

Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word ''[[wikt:milk#English|milk]]'' is clearly a cognate of German ''[[wikt:Milch#German|Milch]]'', Dutch ''[[wikt:melk#Dutch|melk]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:молоко#Russian|молоко (moloko)]]'' and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Slovene_language|Slovenian]] ''mleko'', also Montenegrin ''[[wikt:mlijeko#Serbo-Croatian|mlijeko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Compare also Greek [[wikt:ἀμέλγω#Ancient Greek|ἀμέλγω]] ''amelgō'' "to milk".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, French ''[[wikt:lait#French|lait]]'', Catalan ''llet'', Italian ''latte'', Romanian ''[[wikt:lapte#Romanian|lapte]]'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[wikt:leche#Spanish|leche]]'' and ''[[wikt:leite#Portuguese|leite]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) (all meaning "milk") are less-obvious cognates of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλακτος#Ancient Greek|γάλακτος]]}}'' ''gálaktos'' (genitive singular of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλα#Ancient Greek|γάλα]]}} ''gála'', "milk"), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin ''[[wikt:lac#Latin|lac]]'' "milk" as well as the English word ''[[wikt:lactic#English|lactic]]'' and other terms borrowed from Latin. All of them come from Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂melǵ-|h₂melǵ-]]}} "milk".

Some cognates are semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word {{Hebrew|חוצפה}} ''[[chutzpah]]'' means "impudence," its [[Classical Arabic]] cognate {{lang|ar|حصافة}} ''ḥaṣāfah'' means "sound judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Wehr |editor= J. Milton Cowan| title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |origyear=1979 |year=1994 |publisher=Spoken Language Services, Inc. |location=[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] |isbn=0-87950-003-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the same language==
Cognates within a single language, or ''[[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]]'', may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different.  For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (&lt;PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/wer-|*wer-]]'', "to perceive, watch out for") are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (&lt;PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/sker-|*sker-]]'', "to cut"). In some cases, including this one, one cognate ("skirt") has an ultimate source in another language related to English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= skirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=skirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=early 14c., "lower part of a woman's dress," from Old Norse ''skyrta'' "shirt, a kind of kirtle" }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the other one ("shirt") is native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= shirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=Old English ''scyrte'' "skirt, tunic," from Proto-Germanic *''skurtjon'' "a short garment"  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That happened with many loanwords, such as ''skirt'' in this example, which was borrowed from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] during the [[Danelaw]].

Sometimes both doublets come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the [[Middle French]] ''chef'' ("head"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, but by then, the consonant had changed to a "sh" sound in French. Such word sets can also be called [[etymological twins]], and they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native), ''waggon/wagon'' (Dutch), and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.

A word may also [[loanword|enter another language]], develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; that is called [[reborrowing]]. For example, the Greek word ''κίνημα'' (''kinima'', "movement") became French ''cinéma'' (compare American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "the art of film", "movie theater"). In Greek, ''κίνημα'' (''kinima'', "movement") and ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "filmmaking, cinema") are now doublets.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, ''σινεμά'' stands beside a Greek [[neologism]] based on the original form of the same root, ''κινηματογράφος'' (''kinimatoγráfos''), with the same two meanings as ''cinéma''/''σινεμά''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''ταινία'' (''tainia'').)&lt;/ref&gt;

A less obvious English-language doublet pair is ''[[wikt:grammar|grammar]]'' and ''[[wikt:glamour|glamour]]''.

==False cognates==
[[False cognates]] are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb ''habēre'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because the words evolved from different roots, in this case, different [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]). German ''haben'', like English ''have'', comes from PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/kh₂pyé-|*kh₂pyé-]]'' 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin ''habēre'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*gʰabʰ'', 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: ''much'' from Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/mikilaz|*mikilaz]]'' &lt; PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/meg-|*meǵ-]]'' and ''mucho'' from Latin ''multum'' &lt; PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mel-|*mel-]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ringe|first1=Don|title=A quick introduction to language change|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|website=Univ. of Pennsylvania: Linguistics 001 (Fall 2011)|accessdate=15 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620051440/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-20|location=¶ 29|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative anatomy''' is the study of similarities and differences in the [[anatomy]] of different [[species]]. It is closely related to [[evolutionary biology]] and [[phylogeny]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gaucher |first=Eric A. |last2=Kratzer |first2=James T. |last3=Randall |first3=Ryan N. |date=2010 |title=Deep Phylogeny—How a Tree Can Help Characterize Early Life on Earth|url=http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/1/a002238 |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=a002238 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002238 |pmc=2827910 |pmid=20182607}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[evolution]] of species). 

The science began in the [[classical era]], continuing in [[Early Modern]] times with work by [[Pierre Belon]] who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans.

Comparative anatomy has provided [[evidence of common descent]], and has assisted in the classification of animals.

== History ==
[[File:Belon_Oyseaux.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Skeletons of humans and birds compared by [[Pierre Belon]], 1555.]]

The first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by early commentators with [[Alcmaeon of Croton]].&lt;ref&gt;Blits, K. C. (1999), Aristotle: Form, function, and comparative anatomy. Anat.

Around the same time, [[Andreas Vesalius]] was also making some strides of his own. A young anatomist of Flemish descent made famous by a penchant for amazing charts, he was systematically investigating and correcting the anatomical knowledge of the Greek physician Galen. He noticed that many of Galen's observations were not even based on actual humans. Instead, they were based on animals such as [[oxen]]. Up until that point, Galen and his teachings had been the authority on human anatomy. The irony is that Galen himself had emphasized the fact that one should make one's own observations instead of using those of another, but this advice was lost during the numerous translations of his work. As [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] began to uncover these mistakes, other physicians of the time began to trust their own observations more than those of Galen.  An interesting observation made by some of these physicians was the presence of homologous structures in a wide variety of animals which included humans. These observations were later used by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as he formed his theory of [[Natural Selection]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell2006&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/compar_anat.shtml | title=Comparative Anatomy: Andreas Vesalius | accessdate=2011-02-17 | last=Caldwell | first=Roy | year=2006 | publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Tyson]] is regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy. He is credited with determining that [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are, in fact, mammals. Also, he concluded that [[chimpanzee]]s are more similar to humans than to [[monkey]]s because of their arms. [[Marco Aurelio Severino]] also compared various animals, including birds, in his ''Zootomia democritaea'', one of the first works of comparative anatomy. In the 18th and 19th century, great anatomists like [[George Cuvier]], [[Richard Owen]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] revolutionized our understanding of the basic build and [[systematics]] of [[vertebrates]], laying the foundation for [[Charles Darwin]]'s work on [[evolution]]. An example of a 20th-century comparative anatomist is [[Victor Negus]], who worked on the structure and evolution of the larynx. Until the advent of genetic techniques like [[DNA sequencing]], comparative anatomy together with [[embryology]] were the primary tools for understanding [[phylogeny]], as exemplified by the work of [[Alfred Romer]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Concepts==
&lt;!--{{multiple image | direction=vertical | width= 282 | image1= Human_Heart_vs_Chicken_Heart.png | caption1= The human heart (left) and chicken heart (right) share many similar characteristics.

Two major concepts of comparative anatomy are:
# [[homology (biology)|Homologous structures]] - structures (body parts/anatomy) which are similar in different species because the species have [[common descent]] and have evolved, usually divergently, from a shared ancestor.  They may or may not perform the same function. An example is the forelimb structure shared by [[cat]]s and [[whales]].
# [[Analogy (biology)|Analogous structures]] - structures similar in different organisms because, in [[convergent evolution]], they evolved in a ''similar environment'', rather than were inherited from a recent common ancestor. They usually serve the same or similar purposes. An example is the streamlined torpedo body shape of [[porpoise]]s and [[shark]]s. So even though they evolved from different ancestors, porpoises and sharks developed analogous structures as a result of their evolution in the same aquatic environment. This is known as a homoplasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution |last=Kardong |first=Kenneth V. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-07-802302-6 |location=New York |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

Comparative anatomy has long served as [[evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]], now joined in that role by [[comparative genomics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardison, R.C. |year=2003 |title=Comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=e58 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000058 |pmid=14624258 |pmc=261895}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; it indicates that organisms share a common ancestor.

It also assists scientists in classifying organisms based on similar characteristics of their anatomical structures. A common example of comparative anatomy is the similar bone structures in forelimbs of cats, whales, bats, and humans. All of these appendages consist of the same basic parts; yet, they serve completely different functions. The skeletal parts which form a structure used for swimming, such as a fin, would not be ideal to form a wing, which is better-suited for flight. One explanation for the forelimbs' similar composition is descent with modification. Through random mutations and natural selection, each organism's anatomical structures gradually adapted to suit their respective habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A.  | first2=Jane B. | last2=Reece |title=[[Biology]]|location=San Francisco, CA| publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]]|date=February 2002| pages=438–439| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for development of ''special'' characteristics which differ significantly from general homology were listed by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] as [[von Baer's laws (embryology)|the laws now named after him]].

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

These tables provide a '''comparison of [[netbook]]s'''.

Aspects of netbooks that should be considered:
* Mouse layout that is used. [[Touchpad]] with 2-buttons below, or touchpad with buttons on each side. The latter may make it hard with some operations needing simultaneous presses&lt;!--formulation?--&gt;.
* Battery capacity and operating time.
* Weight and size. The original concept was below {{nowrap|1 kg}} but some manufacturers tend toward 2&amp;nbsp;kg (4.4&amp;nbsp;lb).
* Noise from CPU fan.
* Driver availability for the built-in hardware.
* [[Operating system]] choice.
* Presence of built-in [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]], etc., may help to avoid USB dongles.

The output of a concordancer may serve as input to a [[translation memory]] system for [[computer-assisted translation]], or as an early step in [[machine translation]].

Concordancers are also used in [[corpus linguistics]] to retrieve alphabetically or otherwise sorted lists of linguistic data from the corpus in question, which the [[corpus linguistics|corpus linguist]] then analyzes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28637">{{distinguish|Mutual recursion}}

In [[computer science]], '''corecursion''' is a type of operation that is [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is ''[[Generative_recursion#Structural_versus_generative_recursion|generative recursion]]'' which may lack a definite "direction" inherent in corecursion and recursion.

Where recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as [[stream (computing)|stream]]s, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of ''finite'' steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-''productive''. Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example [[recurrence relation]]s such as the factorial.

Corecursion can produce both [[Finite set|finite]] and [[Infinite set|infinite]] [[data structure]]s as results, and may employ [[self-reference|self-referential]] data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with [[lazy evaluation]], to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in [[functional programming]], where corecursion and [[codata (computer science)|codata]] allow [[total language]]s to work with infinite data structures.

== Examples ==
Corecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and [[Assignment (computer science)|assigned values]] imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.

=== Factorial ===
A classic example of recursion is computing the [[factorial]], which is defined recursively by ''0! := 1'' and ''n! := n × (n - 1)!''.

To ''recursively'' compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) ''itself'' with a different ("smaller" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the ''base case'' has been reached. Thus a [[call stack]] develops in the process. For example, to compute ''fac(3)'', this recursively calls in turn ''fac(2)'', ''fac(1)'', ''fac(0)'' ("winding up" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with ''fac(0) = 1'', and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame ''fac(3)'' that uses the result of ''fac(2) = 2'' to calculate the final result as ''3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)'' and finally return ''fac(3) = 6''. In this example a function returns a single value.

This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial ''corecursively'', as an [[Iteration|iterator]], where one ''starts'' with the case of &lt;math&gt;1 =: 0!&lt;/math&gt;, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers ''1, 2, 3...'' as in the above recursive definition with "time arrow" reversed, as it were, by reading it ''backwards'' as {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;n! \times (n+1) =: (n+1)!&lt;/math&gt;.}} The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a ''stream'' of ''all'' factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]]. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both ''n'' and ''f'' (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;n, f = (0, 1) : (n + 1, f \times (n+1))&lt;/math&gt;
or in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (\(n,f) -&gt; (n+1, f*(n+1))) `iterate` (0,1)
&lt;/source&gt;
meaning, "starting from &lt;math&gt;n, f = 0, 1&lt;/math&gt;, on each step the next values are calculated as &lt;math&gt;n+1, f \times (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; emphasizes that the factorial values are being built ''up'', going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, ''down'' to the base case, with a &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index ''n'' in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.

Note the connection with [[denotational semantics]], where the [[Denotational semantics#Denotations of recursive programs|denotations of recursive programs]] is built up corecursively in this way.

In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:{{efn|Not validating input data.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called for example as &lt;code&gt;factorial(5)&lt;/code&gt; to compute ''5!''.

A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorials():
    n, f = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def n_factorials(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt;= k:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called to produce the factorials up to ''5!'' via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for f in n_factorials(5):
    print(f)
&lt;/source&gt;
If we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def nth_factorial(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt; k:
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
    yield f
&lt;/source&gt;
As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; for the only &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; there) to the accumulator argument technique for [[tail call|tail recursion]], unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.

=== Fibonacci sequence ===
In the same way, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;a, b = (0, 1) : (b, a+b)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that because the Fibonacci sequence is a [[recurrence relation]] of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the &lt;math&gt;(b, -)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the &lt;math&gt;(-, a+b)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using [[parallel assignment]]):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
&lt;/source&gt;
In Haskell, &lt;source lang=haskell&gt; map fst ( (\(a,b) -&gt; (b,a+b)) `iterate` (0,1) )&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tree traversal ===
[[Tree traversal]] via a [[depth-first]] approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, [[breadth-first]] traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.

Without using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure.{{efn|More elegantly, one can start by placing the root node itself in the data structure and then starting the process.}} If the data structure is a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and  if the data structure is a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]] (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.

Using recursion, a (post-order){{efn|Post-order is to make "leaf node is base case" explicit for exposition, but the same analysis works for pre-order or in-order.}} depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.

Using corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value,{{efn|Breadth-first traversal, unlike depth-first, is unambiguous, and visits a node value before processing children.}} then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the ''whole list'' of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc.{{efn|Technically, one may define a breadth-first traversal on an ordered, disconnected set of trees – first the root node of each tree, then the children of each tree in turn, then the grandchildren in turn, etc.}} In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, ''n'') was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of ''n''!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;v, t = ([], FullTree) : (RootValues, ChildTrees)&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt; concatMap fst ( (\(v, t) -&gt; (rootValues t, childTrees t)) `iterate` ([], fullTree) )&lt;/source&gt;

These can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a ''leaf node'' (at the ''bottom'') as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and ''analyzes'' a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off ''below''). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a ''root node'' (at the ''top'') as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being ''synthesized'' of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off ''above''). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.

Notably, given an infinite tree,{{efn|Assume fixed [[branching factor]] (e.g., binary), or at least bounded, and balanced (infinite in every direction).}} the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.

In Python, this can be implemented as follows.{{efn|First defining a tree class, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
class Tree:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left  = left
        self.right = right

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
and initializing a tree, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
t = Tree(1, Tree(2, Tree(4), Tree(5)), Tree(3, Tree(6), Tree(7)))
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example nodes are labeled in breadth-first order:
     1
  2     3
 4 5   6 7
}}
The usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:{{efn|Intuitively, the function iterates over subtrees (possibly empty), then once these are finished, all that is left is the node itself, whose value is then returned; this corresponds to treating a leaf node as basic.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def df(node):
    if node is not None:
        df(node.left)
        df(node.right)
        print(node.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called by &lt;code&gt;df(t)&lt;/code&gt; to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.

The breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:{{efn|1=Here the argument (and loop variable) is considered as a whole, possible infinite tree, represented by (identified with) its root node (tree = root node), rather than as a potential leaf node, hence the choice of variable name.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def bf(tree):
    tree_list = [tree]
    while tree_list:
        new_tree_list = []
        for tree in tree_list:
            if tree is not None:
                yield tree.value
                new_tree_list.append(tree.left)
                new_tree_list.append(tree.right)
        tree_list = new_tree_list
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in bf(t):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Definition==
{{technical|section|date=November 2010}}
[[Initial and terminal objects|Initial data type]]s can be defined as being the [[least fixpoint]] ([[up to isomorphism]]) of some type equation; the [[isomorphism]] is then given by an [[Initial algebra|initial]] [[F-algebra|algebra]]. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the [[greatest fixpoint]] of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final [[F-coalgebra|coalgebra]].

If the domain of discourse is the [[category of sets]] and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, [[Non-well-founded set theory|non-wellfounded]] values, whereas initial types do not.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise and Moss 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss and Danner 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of [[complete partial order]]s and [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]], which corresponds roughly to the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth and Plotkin 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary [[recursion]] recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons and Hutton 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--G&amp;H ascribe this definition to Barwise and Moss--&gt;

The discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Doets and van Eijck 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.

==Discussion==
{{cleanup|section|reason=mix of discussion, examples, and related concepts|date=July 2012}}
{{Expert needed|Computer science|2=section|date=November 2010}}
The rule for ''primitive corecursion'' on [[codata (computer science)|codata]] is the dual to that for [[primitive recursion]] on data. Instead of descending on the argument by [[pattern-matching]] on its constructors (that ''were called up before'', somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. "fields"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its "destructors" (or "observers", that ''will be called afterwards'', somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion ''creates'' (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion ''analyses'' (necessarily finite) data.  Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate.  Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.

In "Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes"&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc and Paulin-Mohring, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; we find
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
hd (conc a s) = a               
tl (conc a s) = s

(sieve p s) = if div p (hd s) then sieve p (tl s)
              else conc (hd s) (sieve p (tl s))

hd (primes s) = (hd s)          
tl (primes s) = primes (sieve (hd s) (tl s))
&lt;/source&gt;
where primes "are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;p, s = (0, [2..]) : (hd(s), sieve(hd(s),tl(s)))&lt;/math&gt;
or in Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
(\(p, s@(h:t)) -&gt; (h, sieve h t)) `iterate` (0, [2..])
&lt;/source&gt;
The authors discuss how the definition of &lt;code&gt;sieve&lt;/code&gt; is not guaranteed always to be ''productive'', and could become stuck e.g. if called with &lt;code&gt;[5,10..]&lt;/code&gt; as the initial stream.

Here is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of [[Fibonacci numbers]] in linear time:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
&lt;/source&gt;

This infinite list depends on lazy evaluation;  elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.

This can be done in Python as well:&lt;ref&gt;Hettinger 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
from itertools import tee, chain, islice, imap

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def fibonacci():
    def deferred_output():
        for i in output:
            yield i
    result, c1, c2 = tee(deferred_output(), 3)
    paired = imap(add, c1, islice(c2, 1, None))
    output = chain([0, 1], paired)
    return result

for i in islice(fibonacci(), 20):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

The definition of &lt;code&gt;zipWith&lt;/code&gt; can be inlined, leading to this:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
  where
    next (a: t@(b:_)) = (a+b):next t
&lt;/source&gt;

This example employs a self-referential ''data structure''.   Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential ''functions'',   but does not accommodate self-referential data.   However,  this is not essential to the Fibonacci example.    It can be rewritten as follows:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = fibgen (0,1)
fibgen (x,y) = x : fibgen (y,x+y) 
&lt;/source&gt;

This employs only self-referential ''function'' to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with [[lazy evaluation|non-strict]] list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.

{{anchor|corecursive queue breadth-first tree traversal}}Corecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue&lt;ref&gt;Allison 1989; Smith 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a particularly good example of this phenomenon.   The following definition produces a [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of a binary tree in linear time:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree a b = Leaf a  |  Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)

bftrav :: Tree a b -&gt; [Tree a b]
bftrav tree = queue
  where
    queue = tree : gen 1 queue

    gen  0   p                 =         []           
    gen len (Leaf   _     : s) =         gen (len-1) s 
    gen len (Branch _ l r : s) = l : r : gen (len+1) s  
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees.   This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result (&lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;gen len p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; produces its output &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; notches after its input back-pointer, &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;, along the &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;).  It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite.  The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination;  this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees.  &lt;!-- Even if the result is finite, this example depends on lazy evaluation due to the use of self-referential data structures.

why the above was removed: it isn't true: the Haskell code can be translated into Prolog quite straightforwardly. Prolog is not a lazy language. But it does have tail recursion modulo cons. Which is emulatable in Scheme, C, etc.

bftrav(Tree,Q):- Q=[Tree|R], bfgen(1,Q,R).
bfgen(0,_,[]):- !.
bfgen(N,[leaf(_)        |P], R       ):- N2 is N-1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
bfgen(N,[branch(_,Lt,Rt)|P],[Lt,Rt|R]):- N2 is N+1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
--&gt;

Another particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Gibbons 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The function &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion,  and replaces each label with an integer,  each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one.   This solution employs a self-referential data structure,  and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
label :: Tree a b -&gt; Tree Int Int 
label t = t′
    where
    (t′, ns) = go t (1:ns)

    go :: Tree a b    -&gt; [Int]  -&gt; (Tree Int Int, [Int])
    go   (Leaf   _    ) (n:ns) = (Leaf   n       , n+1 : ns  )
    go   (Branch _ l r) (n:ns) = (Branch n l′ r′ , n+1 : ns′′)
                                where
                                  (l′, ns′ ) = go l ns
                                  (r′, ns′′) = go r ns′
&lt;/source&gt;

An [[apomorphism]] (such as an [[anamorphism]], such as [[Unfold (higher-order function)|unfold]]) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a [[paramorphism]] (such as a [[catamorphism]], such as [[Fold (higher-order function)|fold]]) is a form of recursion.

The [[Coq]] proof assistant supports corecursion and [[coinduction]] using the CoFixpoint command.

== History ==
Corecursion, referred to as ''circular programming,'' dates at least to {{Harv|Bird|1984}}, who credits [[John Hughes (computer scientist)|John Hughes]] and [[Philip Wadler]]; more general forms were developed in {{Harv|Allison|1989}}. The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Crônica''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''chronicle'') is a Portuguese form of short writings about daily topics, published in newspaper or magazine [[Column (periodical)|columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.eca.usp.br/pjbr/arquivos/ensaios5_b.htm|title=Revista PJ:Br - Jornalismo Brasileiro|website=www2.eca.usp.br|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crônicas are usually written in an informal, observational and sometimes humorous tone, as in an intimate conversation between writer and reader. Writers of crônicas are called ''cronistas''. It is considered to be a purely Brazilian literary genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/8670548/Um_g%C3%AAnero_brasileiro_a_cr%C3%B4nica_Paulo_R%C3%B3nai_|title=Um gênero brasileiro, a Crônica|last=Rónai|first=Paulo|work=Crônicas Brasileiras: A Portuguese Reader|publisher=University of Florida Center for Latin American Studies)|year=1971|isbn=978-0813003252|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper crônicas had their inception in the 19th century, with the development of the press in Brazil, inspired by the French ''[[Journal des débats]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNwLBAAAQBAJ|title=Tempo de Ensaio (2): múltiplos olhares sobre o literário ensaios de graduandos em letras|last=Nascimento|first=Luciana Marino do|date=2014-07-18|publisher=Letra Capital Editora LTDA|isbn=9788577852727|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; they flourished in the mid of the 20th century, with the country's urbanization process, musing about daily happenings and becoming more informal in nature. Crônicas, despite their ephemeral nature, are usually compiled in book anthologies.

Some authors known by their crônicas are [[Machado de Assis]], [[Rubem Braga]], [[Fernando Sabino]], [[Paulo Mendes Campos]], [[Rachel de Queiroz]] and [[Luís Fernando Veríssimo]].

'''DeLorme''' is a producer of personal satellite tracking, messaging, and navigation technology. The company’s main product, ''inReach'', integrates [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and satellite technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/delorme-inreach-explorer-gps-navigation/31789/|title=New Delorme inReach combines GPS navigation and emergency communications|website=newatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''inReach'' provides the ability to send and receive text messages anywhere in the world (including when beyond cell phone range) by using the [[Iridium satellite constellation]]. By pairing with a smart phone, navigation is possible with access to free downloadable [[topographic maps]] and NOAA charts. On February 11, 2016, the company announced that it had been purchased by [[Garmin]], a multinational producer of GPS products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gpsworld.com/garmin-to-acquire-outdoor-tracking-company-delorme/|title=Garmin to acquire outdoor tracking company DeLorme|date=2016-02-12|work=GPS World|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GarminBuys&gt;[http://newsroom.garmin.com/press-release/corporate/garmin-signs-purchase-agreement-acquire-delorme Garmin® Signs Purchase Agreement to Acquire DeLorme®], 11 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

DeLorme also produces printed atlas and topographic software products. The company combines digital technologies with human editors to verify travel information and map details. ''DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer'' is a complement to a vehicle’s GPS or online mapping site, allowing a traveler to browse and highlight the anticipated route and the possible activities or excursions along the way or at the destination. DeLorme’s ''Topo'' software is one of the sources of North American trail, logging road and terrain data for outdoor enthusiasts. ''Topo 10'' has US and Canada topographic maps and elevation data with more than four million places of interest. ''Topo'' includes comprehensive park, lake, river and stream data for all 50 states. DeLorme continues to sell paper atlases, with more than 20 million copies sold to date.

Founded in 1976, DeLorme is headquartered in [[Yarmouth, Maine|Yarmouth]], [[Maine]], and is home to [[Eartha]], the world's largest revolving [[globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2015/06/27/take-offbeat-roadtrip/K9tOL2UjgAFyO127DwX9mM/story.html|title=Take an offbeat roadtrip - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in 1976 by David DeLorme, who, being frustrated over obsolete back-country maps of the [[Moosehead Lake]] region of [[Maine]], vowed to create a better map of Maine.

DeLorme combined state highway, county, and town maps as well as federal surveys to produce the ''Maine Atlas and Gazetteer'' which was printed in a large-format book with an initial printing of 10,000, which he marketed out of his car. ''The Gazetteer'', which listed [[bicycle trail]]s, canoeing and kayaking trips, and museum and historic sites, proved quite successful.

The company expanded to 75 employees in 1986, working from a [[Quonset hut]] in [[Freeport, Maine]], producing maps for [[New England]] and upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="fundinguniverse.com"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/DeLorme-Publishing-Company-Inc-Company-History.html International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 53. St. James Press, 2003 (via Fundinguniverse.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the company produced a [[compact disc|CD]] with detailed topographic map data of the entire world.

In 1991, DeLorme began vending ''Street Atlas USA'' on a single CD-ROM, becoming the most popular street-map CD in the United States, as well as one of the first mass consumer CD-ROM software products of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD-ROM: THE NEXT PC REVOLUTION CD-ROMs|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1992/06/29/76592/index.htm|website=fortune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1995, DeLorme had 44 percent of the market share for CD maps. The same year the company partnered with the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA) to produce the ''AAA Map 'n Go'', the first mapping product to generate automatic routing.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} They also introduced the DeLorme GPS receiver to work with its maps.&lt;ref name="fundinguniverse.com"/&gt;

In 1996, it introduced its maps into the [[PDA]] environment via [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]].

In 1997, the company relocated to a new corporate campus in Yarmouth, Maine, that features a giant model of the world, named [[Eartha]], the largest rotating globe in the world. The company has provided complimentary geographic educational sessions for thousands of school children over the years and the public is welcome to visit and see Eartha from the three-story balconies.

In 1999, DeLorme introduced ''3D TopoQuad'' DVD and CD products, which include digitized U.S. topographic maps.

In 2001, ''XMap'' professional [[Geographic information system|GIS]] map program was produced on CD, and an expanded ''XMap'' was released in 2002, modified to provide GPS functionality to [[Palm OS]] and [[Pocket PC]].

In 2005, DeLorme became the first company to sell a [[USB]] GPS device, the Earthmate GPS LT-20. At the same time, it began offering downloadable satellite and USGS 7.5-minute quads that could be overlaid on its maps using a new NetLink feature. Earlier models of Earthmate were among the first GPS receivers tethered to laptops.

In 2006/2007, the firm introduced its first full-featured GPS standalone receiver, the [[Earthmate GPS PN-20]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delorme.com/about/innovation.aspx A Mapping Industry Leader for Over 30 Years - Delorme.com]&lt;/ref&gt; During 2008, the company continued expanding its handheld GPS line with the Earthmate GPS PN-40 model. DeLorme also began selling OEM GPS modules allowing other manufacturers to add GPS to their products. In addition, the company began selling data to businesses.

In 2009, DeLorme released D.A.E. (Digital Atlas of the Earth). It is the first worldwide GPS accurate topographical map with a scale of 1 to 50,000. D.A.E. is the official world map for the US and Australian militaries.  It is a virtual globe of the earth that is almost 1,000 feet in diameter.

In 2011, DeLorme launched "InReach," a worldwide satellite communication and SOS device that fits in your pocket.  It works in the middle of the ocean, at the north pole, through triple canopy jungles, and has even been proven on the summit of Mt. Everest.  Through the SOS feature, 3 rescues a day occur around the world.&lt;ref&gt;David DeLorme&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition ==
On February 11, 2016, GPS products and services company [[Garmin]] announced it had agreed to purchase DeLorme.&lt;ref name=GarminBuys /&gt; The announcement stated operations at DeLorme's Yarmouth facility would continue. Another announcement (March 3, 2016) confirmed the acquisition was complete.&lt;ref name="GarminComplete"&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=March 3, 2016|title=Garmin® completes acquisition of DeLorme® &amp;#124; Garmin Newsroom|url=http://newsroom.garmin.com/press-release/outdoor/garmin-completes-acquisition-delorme|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Easton's Bible Dictionary 1894.jpg|thumb|''Easton's Bible Dictionary'' (1894) book cover]]
The '''''Illustrated Bible Dictionary''''',{{efn|Full title: ''Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature with Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps''.{{sfnp|Easton|1893}}}} better known as '''''Easton's Bible Dictionary''''', is a reference work on topics related to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] compiled by [[Matthew George Easton]]. The first edition was published in 1893,{{sfnp|Easton|1893}} and a revised edition was published the following year.{{sfnp|Easton|1894}} The most popular edition, however, was the third,  published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] in 1897, three years after Easton's death.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} The last contains nearly 4,000 entries relating to the [[Bible]]. Many of the entries in ''Easton's'' are [[encyclopedia#Characteristics|encyclopedic]] in nature, although there are also short dictionary-type entries.

Because of its age, it is now a [[public domain resource]].

'''The Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS)''' is a national data archiving and dissemination service that was founded in January 2003. It is funded jointly by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and [[Jisc]]. In July 2012, the ESRC announced it will become a partner in the UK Data Service, to be established as of October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ESRC|title=New national digital repository for social and economic data|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/press-releases/22231/new-national-digital-repository-for-social-and-economic-data.aspx|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of work==
ESDS provides access to and support for a wide range of key economic and social data in the UK. The collection covers both quantitative and qualitative data which span many different disciplines and themes.

==Structure==
ESDS service is a distributed service, based on collaboration between four key centres of expertise: [[UK Data Archive]], [[Institute for Social and Economic Research]] (ISER), both based at the [[University of Essex]]; [[Manchester Information and Associated Services]] (Mimas) and [[Cathie Marsh Centre for Census and Survey Research]] (CCSR), both located at the [[University of Manchester]].

These centres work in collaboration to acquire, process, preserve and disseminate a wide range of data across the social sciences. ESDS also provides enhanced user support and training for the secondary use of data for the research, learning and teaching communities.

==Data services==
The [[UK Data Archive]] is responsible for the overall direction and management of the ESDS. Within ESDS, four specialist data services provide value-added support as follows:

* [[ESDS Government]] promotes and facilitates the use of large-scale government surveys, such as the Labour Force Survey and Health Survey for England  in research, learning, and teaching.
* [[ESDS International]] provides access to, and support for, international (typically comparative) datasets from both survey and aggregate sources.
* [[ESDS Longitudinal]] supports a range of the key UK longitudinal data.
* [[ESDS Qualidata]] provides access to, and support for, qualitative datasets, from classic studies from the 1960s and 1970s to contemporary data.

Study descriptions and online documentation, including questionnaires, of datasets can be accessed online free of charge and without registering. Access to data requires registration and uses federated access management (shibboleth) user authentication. Registered users can also download and explore/analyse online a large and growing number of datasets.

[[File:Languages_of_Europe.svg|thumb|300px|Map of major European languages]]
'''Eurolinguistics''' is a neologistic term for the study of the [[languages of Europe]].
The term ''Eurolinguistics'' was first used by Norbert Reiter in 1991 (German equivalent: ''Eurolinguistik''). 
Apart from a series of works dealing with only a part of the European languages, the work of [[Harald Haarmann]] pursues a "pan- or trans-European perspective". This goal is also pursued by Mario Wandruszka.

Typological questions have mainly been dealt with by the ''Eurolinguistischer Arbeitskreis Mannheim (ELAMA; led by Per Sture Ureland)'' and the ''EUROTYP'' projects. Important sources of linguistic data for Eurolinguistic studies are the ''Atlas Linguarum Europae'' (for vocabulary studies) and the ''World Atlas of Linguistic Structures'' (Haspelmath et al. 2005, for grammar studies).

The internet platform ''EuroLinguistiX (ELiX)'' (edited by [[Joachim Grzega]]) offers a bibliography of Eurolinguistic publications as well as a wiki, a discussion forum, an academic internet journal in order to address also aspects of "linguistic and cultural history", "sociology of languages", "[[language politics]]" and "intercultural communication". In 2006, Joachim Grzega published a basic reader on common features of European languages.

Also joint with the ''ELAMA'', the ''EuroLSJ project'' by Erhard Steller tries to collect essential results of Eurolinguistics and make them usable for everyday life in Europe by transforming them into a representative standard language (''LSJ European / Europé LSJ'') which wants to serve as an optimized "acquisition and memory helper" (Giuseppe G. Castorina) for a quicker and easier access to all languages of Europe.

== Common features of European languages==

===Writing system===
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1991, Grzega 2006)

Writing was introduced by the Greeks and from there also brought to the Romans (6th century BC). There are five alphabets in regular use in the areas generally considered Europe. The [[Latin alphabet]] was developed into several scripts. In the early years of Europe, the [[Carolingian minuscule]]s were the most important variety of the Latin script. From this two branches developed, the [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]]/Fracture/German tradition, which Germans used well into the 20th century, and the Italian/Italic/[[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]]/Latin tradition, still used. For some nations the integration into Europe meant giving up older scripts, e.g. the Germanic gave up the runes ([[Runic alphabet|Futhark]]) (3rd to 17th centuries), the Irish the [[Ogham]] script (4th to 7th centuries). The [[Cyrillic script]] is the second most widespread alphabet in Europe, and was developed in the 9th century under the influence of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] alphabets.  Both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets are used for multiple languages in multiple states, both inside and outside Europe.  As well as these two, there are three alphabets used primarily for a single language, although they are occasionally applied to minority languages in the states from which they originate.  The oldest of these alphabets is the [[Greek alphabet]], which could be considered the progenitor of all the surviving alphabets of Europe, with the earliest recorded inscriptions appearing in the 9th century BC.  The other two are both found in the [[Caucasus]], both originating in the 5th century.  The [[Georgian alphabet]] is used  primarily to write Georgian, though it is also used to write the other Kartvelian languages, [[Svan language|Svan]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz language|Laz]], all of which are found largely within the borders of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  The [[Armenian alphabet]] is used to write the [[Armenian language]], which has two dialects, and has been used to write [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the past.

===Sound features===
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1973, Asher 1994, Price 1998, Grzega 2006)

The sound systems of languages may differ considerably between languages. European languages can thus rather be characterized negatively, e.g. by the absence of [[click consonant|click sounds]]. One could also think of specific [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features, such as [[tonal language|tonal]] accents. But there are also tonal languages in Europe: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (e.g. ''lètī'' ‘he flies, is flying’ with long rising accent vs. ''lêta'' ‘years’ with long falling accent) and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (e.g. ''sûda'' ‘of the vessel’ with long falling accent vs. ''súda'' ‘of the court’ with long rising accent). In Slovene, the use of the musical accent is declining though (cf. Rehder 1998: 234) --but there are hardly any contexts where intelligibility is endangered. In Sweden [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (but not in [[Finland Swedish]]) there also is a pitch accent in some words, which can be meaningful, e.g. ''´anden'' ‘the duck’ vs. ''ˇanden'' ‘the ghost, spirit’.

===Grammatical features===
(Sources and further information for this section: Asher 1994, Price 1998, Haspelmath 2001, Heine/Kuteva 2006)

As a general introductory remark we can distinguish between three '''structural types''' of languages: 
* [[isolating language|isolating]] (i.e. grammatical/sentence functions are expressed through analytic means and relatively strict word-order rules, e.g. the strict S-V order rule in English),
* [[agglutinating]] (i.e. grammatical/sentence functions are expressed through [[affix]]es, with one affix expressing exactly one function) and
* [[inflective|inflecting]] (i.e. grammatical/sentence functions are expressed through affixes, with one affix expressing several functions).
European languages are seldom pure representatives of one type. For (a) Modern English is a good example (and in many way the code oral of French verbs); for (c) Old English and Modern High German are good examples (and in many ways the code écrit of French verb forms); classical representatives of type (b) are Finnish and Hungarian. If a language is not isolating, this does not necessarily mean that it has no word-order rules. [[Latin]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and the [[Slavic languages]] have a relatively free [[word order]], whereas many languages show more restricted rules. [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], e.g., show verb-second word-order in main clauses and verb-final order in subordinate [[clause]]s. English has [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[verb]] word-order, which is also preferred by the [[Romanic languages]]. [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] have a basic verb-initial word order.

We can also distinguish between analytic constructions (with free grammatical [[morpheme]]s, i.e. grammatical elements as separate words) and synthetic constructions (with bound grammatical morphemes, i.e. grammatical elements attached to or included in a word), e.g. ''the house '''of''' the man'' vs. ''the man''''s''' house''.

Apart from the points already mentioned, the categories of '''[[grammatical aspect|aspect]]''' (not always easy to separate from the tense system) and gender are noteworthy. Under the category of aspect linguists basically understand the distinction between perfective actions (activity finished, has led to a result; single event) and imperfective actions (activity not yet finished, w/out information on termination; long duration, repetitive). The Slavic languages have a fine and rigid aspect system; in English there’s the distinction between progressive and non-progressive (simple) and a distinction between present perfect and past; in the Romanic languages the imperfect serves to denote background actions.

The most current '''[[grammatical gender|gender]]''' systems in Europe are twofold (masculine vs. feminine, e.g. in the Romanic languages, or uter vs. neuter, e.g. in Swedish and Danish); but there are also languages that are threefold (e.g. Slavic, German) or lack grammatical gender at all (e.g. English, Hungarian, Finnish). The problem of gender also concerns the system of personal [[pronoun]]s. We normally distinguish between three persons singular and three persons plural, but there are also some languages that have specific words for the dual (e.g. [[Slovene language|Slovene]]). In the 3rd person singular we often have a distinction according to grammatical gender; in English, though, the choice is determined by natural gender; in Hungarian and Finnish we have no differentiation at all, in the Scandinavian languages on the other hand we have a differentiation that incorporate both grammatical and natural gender. In some languages the grammatical gender is also relevant in the 3rd pl. (e.g. the Romance languages).

Whereas traditionally we group languages according to historical language families (e.g. [[Indo-European languages]], [[Uralic languages]]), a more modern way is to look at grammatical features from a synchronic point of view. A certain number of common structural features would then characterize a [[sprachbund]]. For Europe, the most prominent sprachbund that we can determine is referred to as SAE (= [[Standard Average European]]) or Charlemagne sprachbund. Haspelmath (2001) illustrates that German, Dutch, [[French language|French]], [[Occitan]] and Northern [[Italian language|Italian]] are the most central members of this sprachbund. Important features are (cf., e.g., Haspelmath 2001, Heine/Kuteva 2006): 
# the distinction between an indefinite and a definite [[article (grammar)|article]]
# the formation of [[relative clause]]s, which are positioned after the (pro)noun concerned and are introduced by a variable [[relative pronoun]]
# a [[past tense]] construction with “to have”
# a [[passive voice]] construction that shows the object of the action in the syntactic position of the subject and that uses the past participle in connection with an auxiliary
# a specific [[suffix]] for the [[comparative]]

===Vocabulary===
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1975, Haarmann 1993, Paczolay 1997, Panzer 2000, Görlach 2002)

'''Latin, French and English''' not only served or still serve as [[lingua franca|''linguae francae'']] (cf. below), but also influenced the vernacular/national languages due to their high prestige. Due to this prestige, there are not only “necessity loans”, but also “luxury loans” and pseudo-loans. Many loans from these three languages (esp. Neo-Latin with its Greek elements) can be considered [[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalisms]], although occasionally the meanings vary from one language to another, which might even lead to misunderstandings. Examples: 
* Lat. ''forma'': e.g. Fr. ''forme'', It. Sp. Cat. Cz. Slovak. Serbian. Slovene Maltese Hung. Pol. Croat. Latv. Lith. ''forma'', Dan. Swed. E. Du. ''vorm'' (shape) and ''form'' (aerobic endurance), Romansh ''furma'', G. ''Form'', Ir. ''foirm''
* Fr. ''restaurant'', e.g. E. Du. Norw. Cat. Romansh ''restaurant'', G. ''Restaurant'', Swed. ''restaurang'', Pg. ''restaurante'', Sp. ''restaurante'', It. ''ristorante'', Cz. ''restaurace'', Slovak ''reštaurácia'', Slovene ''restavracija'', Latv. ''restorâns'', Lith. ''restoranas'', Estn. ''restoran'', Pol. ''restauracja'', Serbian ''restoran'', Maltese ''ristorant''/''restorant''
* E. ''manager'', e.g. Du. Norw. Swed. Icel. Fr. Sp. Cat. It. Finn. Romansh ''manager'', G. ''Manager'', Pol. ''menadżer'', Serb. ''menadžer'', Croat. ''menedžer'', Lith. ''menedžeris'', Hung. ''menedzser'', Maltese ''maniġer''

Three minor source languages for European borrowings are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (esp. in mathematics and science, foreign plants and fruits), Italian (esp. in arts, esp. from the 15th to the 17th centuries), German (esp. in arts, education, mining, trading from the 12th to the 20th centuries with alternating importance).

As far as the structuring or “wording” of the world is concerned changes occur relatively fast due to progresses in knowledge, sociopolitical changes etc. Lexical items that seem more conservative are proverbs and [[metaphor]]ical idioms. Many European proverbs and idioms go back to Antiquity and the Bible, some originate in national stories and were spread over other languages via Latin. A typical European proverb to express that there is no profit without working can be paraphrased as “Roasted pigeons/larks/sparrows/geese/chickens/birds don’t fly into one’s mouth”, e.g.  Cz. ''Pečeni ptáci nelítají do huby (birds!)'' = Dan. ''Stegte duer flyve ingen i munden (pigeon!)'' = ndl. ''De gebraden duiven vliegen je niet in de mond (pigeons!)'' = E. ''He thinks that larks will fall into his mouth roasted'' = Finn. ''Ei paistetut varpuset suuhun lennä (sparrows!)'' = Fr. ''Les alouettes ne vous tombent pas toutes rôties dans le bec (larks!)'' = G. ''Gebratene Tauben fliegen einem nicht ins Maul (pigeon!)'' = Hungar. ''Senkinek nem repül a szájába a sült galamb (pigeon!)'' = Lith. ''Keptas karvelis neatlėks pats i burną (pigeon!)'' = Latv. ''Cepts zvirbulis no jumta mutē nekrīt (sparrow!)'' = ([[Nynorsk]]) Norw. ''Det kjem ikkje steikte fuglar fljugande i munnen (bird!)'' = Pol. ''Pieczone gołąbki nie przydą same do gąbki (pigeons!)'' = Slovak ''Nech nik nečaká, že mu pečené holuby budú padať do úst (pigeons!)'' = Slovene ''Pečeni golobje ne lete nobenemu v usta [pigeons!] = Swed. Stekta sparvar flyger inte in i munnen (sparrows!)''.

===Communicative strategies===
(Sources and further information for this section: Axtell 1993, Collett 1993, Morrison et al. 1994, Hickey/Stewart 2005, Grzega 2006)

In [[Geert Hofstede]]’s terms Europe can, to a large extent, be considered an '''individualistic''' civilization (i.e. a rather direct and analytic style is preferred, important points are mentioned before an explanation or illustration in an argument, decisions are based on compromise or the majority’s vote); in contrast, the Sinic (Chinese), Japanese, Arabic and Hindu (Indian) civilizations are collectivistic (i.e. a rather indirect and synthetic style is used, explanations and illustrations are mentioned before the essential point of an argument, decisions are reached through consent). We can further make [[Edward Hall]]’s distinction between “low context” communication (i.e. direct style, person-oriented, self-projection, loquacity) and “high context” communication (i.e. indirect style, status-oriented, reservation, silence). Most European nations use '''“low context” communication'''.

What are some specific features of European communication strategies? 
# One of them is the mostly reciprocal use of '''address terms''' (this is different in Slavic and Asian civilizations, for totally different reasons). Status seems to play a less important role than in the Sinic, Korean, and Japanese civilizations. Communication between the sexes is absolutely normal in Europe, whereas it is traditionally very rare in the Arabic civilization. As to pronouns, we can point out the pronominal dualism in the vast majority of European languages: Romance, such as French, or Spanish (which also exists in Argentina, Uruguay, Guatemala [''vos'' vs. ''usted''], German, Slavic languages [e.g. Russ. ''ty'' vs. ''vy'']; it has also been said that the American dialect form ''y'all'' is/was occasionally used as a formal address pronoun—cf. [[y'all]]). There are also tendencies in the nominal series of address terms, which distinguish Europe from other civilizations. In private, Europeans nowadays agree on addressing each other by the first name comparatively fast; in business communication, one should first use the correct title, even if a change toward less formal addressing may occur quite rapidly again. Titles are definitely more important in the Hindu, Arabic, Sinic and Japanese civilizations; the Slavic civilization can be characterized particularly by the frequency of nicknames in all kinds of private and informal conversation. This is especially valid of Slavic Orthodox countries, such as Russia. Nicknames are sometimes also used in informal and social situations among close friends and associates in the Americas (North and South/Latin), but to a somewhat lesser extent.
# Concerning '''salutation terms''' in Europe (cf. especially Spillner 2001) we find that many of them include wishes for a good time of the day, for health (or the question whether somebody is in good health), for success or for luck. The common Arabic and Asiatic wish for peace, though, is rare in European civilization; the exception being the ecclesiastical Latin ''Pax tecum/vobiscum''. It is also noteworthy that many European salutation phrases are frequently (at least in informal situations) very much reduced on a phonetic level, which is not so much the case in Arabic, Hindu (Indian), Sinic (Chinese) and Japanese civilizations.
# Frequent '''small talk''' topics are traveling, soccer (and other international sports disciplines), hobbies, the entertainment industry and the weather. In contrast, sexuality, death, religion, politics, money or class, personal issues and swearing are generally tabooed. Any racial, ethnic, sexist and cultural biased comments are shunned and morally opposed in Europe (and all developed countries) more than anywhere else. In Hindu, Arabic, Sinic and Japanese civilization people are frequently asked about their family (in Arabic civilization, however, this excludes the wife...even the word "wife" is compared to the "F" word in English-speaking countries). Due to their status-oriented nature, people from the Far East civilizations often ask for “administrative form” information, especially in Japan.
# Among Europeans (includes the Americas and Australia) and sometimes east Asians (esp. in Japan), the phrases for '''“thank you”''' are expected and welcomed in quite a number of situations (it's said the most in Great Britain and North America), whereas South Asian and Middle Eastern people use the phrase in a more economical way and often contend themselves with simple looks of thanks; on the other hand, other non-western civilizations (i.e. Polynesians of the south Pacific and Native American tribes) have rather extended formulae of thanks.
# With '''requests''' (cf. especially Trosborg 1995 and Cenoz/Valencia 1996), the bare imperative is normally avoided in favor of devices such as questions, modal auxiliaries, subjunctive, conditional, special adverbs. The exchange of verbal stems, which is found in Japanese and Sinic languages, is not a part of (Indo-)European languages.
# When somebody has to '''say no''', this is normally accompanied by some form of apology or explanation. In the civilizations of the Far East and many Native American tribes in North America, the formal equivalents for “no” are unaccepted and/or basically tabooed in general.
# '''Apologies''' are necessary with face-threatening acts or after somebody has intruded somebody else’s private sphere—which is bigger and thus more easily violated in North America and Asia than in Europe and bigger in Europe (esp. the British Isles for etiquette reasons) than in Latin America and the Arab nations, and the concept of privacy and apology is universal, but varies from northern/western, eastern/Slavic and southern/Mediterranean countries. (Cf. especially Trosborg 1995).
# If the national descriptions by Axtell (1998) and Morris et al. (1979) are compared, then the following conclusions can be drawn with regard to '''compliments''': in Europe one can safely make compliments on somebody’s clothes and appearance, meals and restaurants, voluntary offerings, a room’s equipment.

==Linguae Francae==
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1975, Haarmann 1993, Grzega 2006)

Europe’s history is characterized by three [[lingua franca|linguae francae]]:
* (Medieval and Neo-) '''[[Latin]]'''  with a gradual decline as lingua franca since the late [[Middle Ages]], when the [[vernacular]] languages gained more and more importance (first language academy in Italy in 1582/83), in the 17th century even at universities) apart from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]).
* '''[[French Language|French]]''' (from the times of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and [[Louis XIV]], c. 1648 (i.e. after the [[Thirty Years' War]], which had hardly affected [[France]], thus free to prosper), till the end of [[World War I]], c. 1918)European languages
* '''[[English Language|English]]'''

Linguae francae that were less widespread, but still played a comparatively important role in European history are:
* [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ([[Occitan]]) (12th to 14th centuries, due to the [[troubadour]] poetry)
* [[Middle Low German]] (14th to 16th centuries, during the heyday of the [[Hanseatic League]], particularly in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and Northeastern Europe.)
* [[Russian language|Russian]] (19th and 20th centuries, in eastern and central Europe as a result of domination by the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]])

The first type of [[dictionary|dictionaries]] are [[glossary|glossaries]], i.e. more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) Abrogans is among the first. A new wave of [[lexicography]] can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the [[printing press]], with the growing interest for standardizing languages).

==Language and identity, standardization processes==
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1975, Haarmann 1993, Grzega 2006)

In the Middle Ages the two most important definitory elements of Europe were ''Christianitas'' and ''Latinitas''. Thus language—at least the supranational language—played an elementary role. This changed with the spread of the national languages in official contexts and the rise of a national feeling. Among other things, this led to projects of standardizing national language and gave birth to a number of language academies (e.g. 1582 [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence, 1617 Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, 1635 [[Académie française]], 1713 [[Real Academia Española|Real Academia de la Lengua]] in Madrid). “Language” was then (and still is today) more connected with “nation” than with “civilization” (particularly in France). “Language” was also used to create a feeling of “religious/ethnic identity” (e.g. different [[Bible]] translations by Catholics and Protestants of the same language).

Among the first standardization discussions and processes are the ones for Italian (“questione della lingua”: Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian &gt; Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (standard is based on Parisian), English (standard is based on the [[London]] dialect) and (High) German (based on: [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancellery]] of Meißen/Saxony + Middle German + chancellery of [[Prague]]/Bohemia [“Common German”]). But also a number of other nations began to look for and develop a standard variety in the 16th century.

==Linguistic minorities==
(Sources and further information for this section: Stephens 1976, Price 1998, Ahrens 2003, Grzega 2006)

Despite the importance of English as an international lingua franca also in Europe, Europe can be associated with its linguistic diversity, which also includes the special protection of minority languages, e.g. by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] founded in the 1990s. This underlines that the popular view of “one nation = one language” (cf. Wirrer 2003) is mostly false.

A minority language can be defined as a language used by a group that defines itself as an ethnic minority group, whereby the language of this group is typologically different and not a dialect of the standard language. For several years now, Jan Wirrer has been working on the status of minority languages in Europe (cf., e.g., Wirrer 2000 and 2003). In Europe—e.g. thanks to the European Charter of Regional and Minority Language—some languages are in quite a strong position, in the sense that they are given special status, such as Basque, Irish, Welsh/Cymraeg, Catalan, Rhaeto-Romance/Romansh and Romani, native language of the [[Romani people|Roma]]/Gypsies in southern Europe), whereas others are in a rather weak position (e.g. Frisian, Scottish Gaelic, Turkish, Saami/Lappish, Sorbian/Wendish and Yiddish, the once common language of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in Eastern Europe). Especially [[allochthonous]] minority languages are not given official status in the EU.

Some minor languages don’t even have a standard yet, i.e. they have not even reached the level of an [[ausbausprache]] yet, which could be changed, e.g., if these languages were given official status. (cf. also next section).

==Issues in language politics==
(Sources and further information for this section: Siguan 2002, Ahrens 2003, Grzega 2006)

France is the origin of two laws, or decrees, concerning language: the Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts (1239), which says that every document in France should be written in French (i.e. not in Latin nor Occitan) and the French [[Loi Toubon]], which aims at eliminating Anglicisms from official documents. But a characteristic feature of Europe is linguistic diversity and tolerance, which is not only shown by the European Charta of Regional and Minority Languages. An illustrative proof of the promotion of linguistic diversity in the Middle Ages is the translation school in [[Toledo, Spain]], founded in the 12th century (in medieval Toledo the Christian, the Jewish and the Arab civilizations lived together remarkably peacefully).

This tolerant linguistic attitude is also the reason why the EU’s general rule is that every official national language is also an official EU language. However, Letzebuergish/[[Luxemburgish]] is not an official EU language, because there are also other (stronger) official languages with “EU status” in that country. Several concepts for an EU language policy are being debated: 
* one official language (e.g. English, [[Interlingua]], or [[Esperanto]]).
* several official languages (e.g. English, French, German, Spanish + another topic-dependent language).
* all national languages as official languages, but with a number of relais languages for translations (e.g. English or Esperanto as relais languages).
* New immigrants in European countries are expected to learn the host nation's language, but are still speaking and reading their native languages (i.e. Arabic, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Swahili and Tahitian) in Europe's increasingly multi-ethnic/multicultural profile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">'''European Component Oriented Architecture''' (ECOA) is an open specification for a software framework for mission system software comprising components that are both [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and [[Service-oriented architecture|service-oriented]].

ECOA is managed by the [[France|French]] [[Direction générale de l'armement]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]] (through the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] - DSTL) with the help of the following [[Working group|industry partners]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The initial study began in January 2008 with French partners, but work on the standard really began in January 2011. In August 2015, the first version of the standard was publishers as a UK Defense standard (DEFSTAN). In December 2015, the standard was republished as a [[Bureau de normalisation de l'aéronautique et de l'espace|BNAE]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.ecoa.technology/news.html#news
| title=News and history
| publisher=www.ecoa.technology
| accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, an updated specification has been made available.

==Concepts==
ECOA defines an architecture framework based on a [[Service-oriented architecture]]. ECOA Software Components (ASCs) are composed of modules which contain the application code and may run in parallel. ECOA provides mechanisms to make these software components portable across computing platforms through use of an interfacing layer called a ''container''. Components  communicate with other components  using [[Event (computing)|events]], [[request–response]] and [[Data|versioned data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''FREIDA Online''', or '''Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/go/freida FREIDA Online homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; is an online database of all graduate medical education programs in the United States that are accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]], provided at no charge by the [[American Medical Association]].

It can be used to search for programs by specialty in a particular state or geographic region as well as to determine specific aspects about any given program (number of first-year spots, salary, years of training, etc.). Optional search criteria, such as program size, whether the program is university hospital based, etc., can also be used to narrow searches. Aggregate statistics of programs in each specialty are available, as well as aggregate information about program graduates.

'''Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (3 June 1853&amp;nbsp;– 28 July 1942), commonly known as '''Flinders Petrie''', was an English [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and a pioneer of systematic methodology in [[archaeology]] and preservation of artifacts. He held the first chair of Egyptology in the United Kingdom, and excavated many of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt in conjunction with his wife, [[Hilda Petrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology', Sharp, M. S. and Lesko, B. S. (eds)&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider his most famous discovery to be that of the [[Merneptah Stele]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Biblical Archaeologist'', American Schools of Oriental Research 1997, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; an opinion with which Petrie himself concurred.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret S. Drower, ''Flinders Petrie: A Life in Archaeology'', 1995, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/paying-homage-to-pioneering-archaeologist-who-lost-his-head-1.456689 Paying homage to pioneering archaeologist who lost his head, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Petrie was born on 3 June 1853 in Maryon Road, [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], Kent, England, the son of [[William Petrie (electrical engineer)|William Petrie]] (1821–1908) and Anne (née Flinders) (1812–1892). Anne was the daughter of Captain [[Matthew Flinders]], who led the first circumnavigation of Australia. William Petrie was an electrical engineer who developed carbon arc lighting and later developed chemical processes for [[Johnson Matthey|Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Petrie, William|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|author=T. E. James|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie was raised in a Christian household (his father being a member of the [[Plymouth Brethren]]), and was educated at home. He had no formal education. His father taught his son how to survey accurately, laying the foundation for his archaeological career. At the age of eight, he was tutored in French, Latin, and Greek, until he had a collapse and was taught at home.  He also ventured his first archaeological opinion aged eight, when friends visiting the Petrie family were describing the unearthing of the [[Brading Roman Villa]] in the Isle of Wight. The boy was horrified to hear the rough shovelling out of the contents, and protested that the earth should be pared away, inch by inch, to see all that was in it and how it lay.&lt;ref&gt;William Matthew Flinders Petrie, ''Seventy Years in Archaeology'', H. Holt and Company 1932. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; "All that I have done since," he wrote when he was in his late seventies, "was there to begin with, so true it is that we can only develop what is born in the mind. I was already in archaeology by nature."&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Seventy Years'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
The chair of [[Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology]] at [[University College London|University College]] London was set up and funded in 1892 following a bequest from [[Amelia Edwards]], who died suddenly in that year. Petrie's supporter since 1880, Edwards had instructed that he should be its first incumbent. He continued to excavate in Egypt after taking up the professorship, training many of the best archaeologists of the day.

In 1913 Petrie sold his large collection of Egyptian antiquities to [[University College, London|University College]], London, where it is now housed in the [[Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology]]. One of his trainees, [[Howard Carter]], went on to discover the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922.

==Archaeology career==
[[File:View from tomb Giza 1881.jpg|thumb|A photograph Petrie took of his view from the tomb he lived in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in Giza 1881]]

In his teenage years, Petrie surveyed British prehistoric monuments&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Alice. 2012. 'We seem to working in the same line'. A.H.L.F. Pitt Rivers and W.M.F. Petrie. Bulletin of the History of Archaeology 22(1): pp.. 4–13.&lt;/ref&gt; (commencing with the late Romano-British 'British Camp' that lay within yards of his family home in Charlton) in attempts to understand their geometry (at 19 producing the most accurate survey of [[Stonehenge]]). His father had corresponded with [[Piazzi Smyth]] about his theories of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and Petrie travelled to Egypt in early 1880 to make an accurate survey of [[Giza]], making him the first to properly investigate how they were constructed (many theories had been advanced on this, and Petrie read them all, but none were based on first hand observation or logic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie's published reports of this triangulation survey, and his analysis of the architecture of Giza therein, was exemplary in its methodology and accuracy, disproved Smyth's theories and still provides much of the basic data regarding the pyramid plateau to this day. On that visit, he was appalled by the rate of destruction of monuments (some listed in guidebooks had been worn away completely since then) and mummies. He described Egypt as "a house on fire, so rapid was the destruction" and felt his duty to be that of a "salvage man, to get all I could, as quickly as possible and then, when I was 60, I would sit and write it all."

Returning to England at the end of 1880, Petrie wrote a number of articles and then met [[Amelia Edwards]], journalist and patron of the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now the [[Egypt Exploration Society]]), who became his strong supporter and later [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie#UCL|appointed him as Professor at her Egyptology chair at University College London]].  Impressed by his scientific approach, they offered him work as the successor to [[Édouard Naville]]. Petrie accepted the position and was given the sum of £250 per month to cover the excavation's expenses. In November 1884, Petrie arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations.

He first went to a [[New Kingdom]] site at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], with 170 workmen. He cut out the middle man role of foreman on this and all subsequent excavations, taking complete overall control himself and removing pressure on the workmen from the foreman to discover finds quickly but sloppily.  Though he was regarded as an amateur and [[Amateur|dilettante]] by more established Egyptologists, this made him popular with his workers, who found several small but significant finds that would have been lost under the old system.
[[File:Sehel-steleFamine (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Famine Stela]] is an inscription located on [[Sehel Island]].]]

In 1886, while working for the Egypt Exploration Fund, Petrie excavated at [[Tell Nebesheh]] in the Eastern Nile Delta. This site is located 8 miles southeast of [[Tanis]] and, among the remains of an ancient temple there, Petrie found a royal sphinx, now located at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Hansen, Erica Ehrenberg, eds. [http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=6lDgYxV0DN8C&amp;pg=PA77 ''Leaving No Stones Unturned: Essays on the Ancient Near East and Egypt in Honor of Donald P. Hansen.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104131948/http://books.google.ca/books?id=6lDgYxV0DN8C&amp;pg=PA77 |date=4 November 2013 }} Eisenbrauns, 2002 {{ISBN|1575060558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Tanis dig, he ran out of funding but, reluctant to leave the country in case it was renewed, he spent 1887 cruising the Nile taking photographs as a less subjective record than sketches. During this time, he also climbed rope ladders at [[Sehel Island]] near [[Aswan]] to draw and photograph thousands of early Egyptian inscriptions on a cliff face, recording embassies to [[Nubia]], [[Famine Stela|famines]] and wars. By the time he reached Aswan, a telegram had reached there to confirm the renewal of his funding. He then went straight to the burial site at [[Fayum]], particularly interested in post-30 BC burials, which had not previously been fully studied. He found intact tombs and 60 of the famous [[Fayum mummy portraits|portraits]], and discovered from inscriptions on the mummies that they were kept with their living families for generations before burial. Under [[Auguste Mariette]]'s arrangements, he sent 50% of these portraits to the [[Egyptian Museum|Egyptian department of antiquities]].

However, when he later found that [[Gaston Maspero]] placed little value on them and left them open to the elements in a yard behind the museum to deteriorate, he angrily demanded that they all be returned, forcing Maspero to pick the 12 best examples for the museum to keep and return 48 to Petrie, who sent them to London for a special showing at the [[British Museum]]. Resuming work, he discovered the village of the Pharaonic tomb-workers.

In 1890, Petrie made the first of his many forays into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], leading to much important archaeological work.  His six-week excavation of [[Tell el-Hesi]] (which was mistakenly identified as [[Lachish]]) that year represents the first scientific excavation of an archaeological site in the [[Holy Land]]. Petrie surveyed a group of tombs in the Wadi al-Rababah (the biblical [[Hinnom]]) of [[Jerusalem]], largely dating to the Iron Age and early Roman periods. Here, in these ancient monuments, Petrie discovered two different metrical systems.

From 1891, he worked on the temple of [[Aten]] at [[Amarna|Tell-el-Amarna]], discovering a {{convert|300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[New Kingdom]] painted pavement of garden and animals and hunting scenes. This became a tourist attraction but, as there was no direct access to the site, tourists wrecked neighbouring fields on their way to it. This made local farmers deface the paintings, and it is only thanks to Petrie's copies that their original appearance is known.

 |title =Petrie's extraordinary visual memory
 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. Flinders Petrie, a contributor of interesting experiments on kindred subjects to ''Nature'', informs me that he habitually works out sums by aid of an imaginary [[Slide rule|sliding rule]], which he sets in the desired way and reads off mentally.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He does not usually visualise the whole rule, but only that part of it with which he is at the moment concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think this is one of the most striking cases of accurate visualising power it is possible to imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Francis Galton]], (1883).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/inquiriesintohum1907galt#page/66/mode/1up ''Inquiries into Human Facility and Its Development'' (1883), pp.66]; Galton also noted (on p.66) that, in relation to the slide rule's markings, "the artist has not put in the divisions very correctly" (illustration at [https://archive.org/stream/inquiriesintohum1907galt#page/97/mode/1up/search/plate page 97, Plate II, Fig.34]).] 
Galton had conducted research ("Statistics of Mental Imagery", ''Mind'', Vol.5, No.19, (July 1880), pp.301-318.) into the extent to which eminent scientists used "mental imagery". On the basis that Galton, himself, had a great personal ability to create, manipulate and employ vivid mental imagery, he was shocked to discover that most eminent scientists not only did not habitually employ mental imagery, but were also, generally, quite incapable of generating "mental images" at will (Galton, 1880). In order to supply a contrast, Galton cited the extraordinary case of Flinders Petrie -- who could easily manipulate precise technical equipment in the spaces of his own imagination.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the 'Israel' or Merneptah stele==
In early 1896, Petrie and his archaeological team were conducting excavations on a temple in Petrie's area of concession at [[Luxor]].&lt;ref&gt;Drower, Flinders Petrie, pp.220–221&lt;/ref&gt; This temple complex was located just north of the original funerary temple of Amenhotep III which had been built on a flood plain.&lt;ref name="Drower, Flinders Petrie, p.221"&gt;Drower, Flinders Petrie, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially surprised that this building which they were excavating:
: 'was also attributed to [[Amenophis III]] since only his name appeared on blocks strewn over the site...Could one king have had two mortuary temples? Petrie dug and soon solved the puzzle: the temple had been built by [[Merneptah]], the son and successor of Ramesses II, almost entirely from stone which had been plundered from the temple of Amenophis III nearby. Statues of the latter had been smashed and the pieces thrown into the foundations; fragments of couchant stone jackals, which must have once formed an imposing avenue approaching the pylon, and broken drums gave some idea of the splendour of the original temple. A statue of Merenptah himself was found—the first known portrait of this king....Better was to follow: two splendid stelae were found,&lt;ref&gt;F. Petrie, Temples of Thebes 1896, London, 1897. pls X-XIV&lt;/ref&gt; both of them usurped on the reverse side by Merenptah, who had turned them face to the wall. One, beautifully carved, showed Amenophis III in battle with Nubians and Syrians; the other, of black granite, was over ten feet high, larger than any stela previously known; the original text commemorated the building achievements of Amenophis and described the beauties and magnificence of the temple in which it had stood. When it could be turned over an inscription of Merenptah recording his triumphs over the Libyans and the Peoples of the Sea was revealed; [Wilhelm] Spiegelberg [a noted German philologist] came over to read it, and near the end of the text he was puzzled by one, that of a people or tribe whom Merenptah had victoriously smitten-''"I.si.ri.ar?"'' It was Petrie whose quick imaginative mind leapt[t] to the solution: "Israel!" Spiegelberg agreed that it must be so. "Won't the reverends be pleased?" was his comment. At dinner that evening Petrie prophesied: "This stele will be better known in the world than anything else I have found." It was the first mention of the word "Israel" in any Egyptian text and the news made headlines when it reached the English papers.'&lt;ref name="Drower, Flinders Petrie, p.221"/&gt;

During the field season of 1895/6, at the Ramesseum, Petrie and the young German Egyptologist Wilhelm Spiegelberg became friends. Spiegelberg was in charge of the edition of many texts discovered by his British colleague, and Petrie offered important collections of artefacts to the University of Strasbourg. In 1897, the Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität Straßburg gratefully conferred to Petrie the title of doctor honoris causa,&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Colin, "Comment la création d'une 'bibliothèque de papyrus' à Strasbourg compensa la perte des manuscrits précieux brûlés dans le siège de 1870", in ''La revue de la BNU'', 2, 2010, p. 28-29 ; 33 ; 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 1902 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=The Times |title=Court Circular |date=6 June 1902 |page=10 |issue=36787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1923, Petrie was knighted for services to British archaeology and Egyptology. The focus of his work shifted permanently to Palestine in 1926 (although he did become interested in early Egypt, in 1928 digging a cemetery at Luxor that proved so huge that he devised an entirely new excavation system, including comparison charts for finds, which is still used today).  He began excavating several important sites in the south-west of Palestine, including [[Tell el-Jemmeh]] and [[Tall al-Ajjul|Tell el-Ajjul]].

In 1933, on retiring from his professorship, he moved permanently to [[Jerusalem]], where he lived with Lady Petrie at the British School of Archaeology, then temporarily headquartered at the [[American School of Oriental Research]] (today the [[Albright Institute of Archaeological Research|W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research]]).

==Death and preservation of head==
[[File:Flinders Petrie headstone - Protestant Cemetery - Jerusalem Israel c. 2009 - 2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Petrie's headstone in the Protestant Cemetery, Jerusalem (2009)]]
Petrie died in Jerusalem on 28 July 1942. His body was interred in the [[Mount Zion Cemetery, Jerusalem (Protestant)|Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion]], but he donated his head (and thus his brain) to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of London]]. World War II was then at its height, and the head was delayed in transit. After being stored in a jar in the college basement, its label fell off and no one knew who the head belonged to.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; However, it was eventually identified, and is now stored, but not displayed, at the Royal College of Surgeons.

==Personal life==
Petrie married [[Hilda Urlin]] (1871–1957) in London on 26 November 1896. The couple had two children, [[John Flinders Petrie|John]] (1907–1972) and Ann (1909–1989). The family originally lived in [[Hampstead, London|Hampstead]], where an [[Blue plaque|English Heritage blue plaque]] has been placed on the building they lived in, 5 Cannon Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/283 | title=Flinders Petrie Blue Plaque |publisher=openplaques.org |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Flinders Petrie became a noted mathematician, who gave his name to the [[Petrie polygon]].

==Legacy==
Petrie's painstaking recording and study of artifacts set new standards in archaeology. He wrote: "I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details." By linking styles of pottery with periods, he was the first to use [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] in Egyptology, a new method for establishing the chronology of a site. Flinders Petrie was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]]. After his death, his wife, Hilda Petrie created a student travel scholarship to Egypt on the Centennial of Petrie's birth in 1953.

Many thousands of artefacts recovered during excavations led by Petrie can be found in museums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/?q=destinations-index&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie remains a controversial figure for his pro-[[eugenics]] views and opinions on other social topics, which spilled over into his disputes with the British Museum's Egyptology expert, [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].  Budge's contention that the religion of the Egyptians was essentially identical to the religions of the people of northeastern and central Africa was regarded by his colleagues as impossible, since all but a few followed Petrie in his contention that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading Caucasoid "[[Dynastic Race]]" which had conquered Egypt in late prehistory and introduced the Pharaonic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie was a dedicated follower of [[eugenics]], believing that there was no such thing as cultural or social innovation in human society, but rather that all social change is the result of biological change, such as migration and foreign conquest resulting in interbreeding. Petrie claimed that his "Dynastic Race", in which he never ceased to believe, was a "fine" Caucasoid race that entered Egypt from the south in late [[predynastic]] times, conquered the "inferior" and "exhausted" "[[mulatto]]" race then inhabiting Egypt, and slowly introduced the finer Dynastic civilisation as they interbred with the inferior indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Silberman, 1999"&gt;Silberman, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie, who was also affiliated with a variety of far right-wing groups and [[anti-democratic thought]] in England and was a dedicated believer in the superiority of the Northern peoples over the Latinate and Southern peoples,&lt;ref name="Silberman, 1999"/&gt; derided Budge's belief that the ancient Egyptians were an African people with roots in eastern Africa as impossible and "unscientific", as did his followers.

His involvement in [[Palestinian archaeology]] was examined in the exhibition "A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0701/07010401|title=A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection|accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/future-past/exhibiton.htm|accessdate=18 February 2007|title=A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Petrie Medal was created in celebration of Petrie's seventieth birthday, when funds were raised to commission and produce 20 medals to be awarded "once in every three years for distinguished work in Archaeology, preferably to a British subject".&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Ucko and Stephen Quirke, "The Petrie Medal", Public Archaeology, vol. 5, no. 1 (2006), pp. 15-25. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/pua.2006.5.1.15?journalCode=ypua20&lt;/ref&gt; The first medal was awarded to Petrie himself (1925), and the first few recipients included Sir [[Aurel Stein]] (1928), Sir [[Arthur Evans]] (1931), Abbé [[Henri Breuil]] (1934), Prof [[John Beazley|J.D. Beazley]] (1937), Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] (1950), Prof [[Alan Wace|J.B. Wace]] (1953), Sir [[Leonard Woolley]] (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Strong and [[Helen Wang]], "Sir Aurel Stein's Medals at the Royal Geographical Society", in Helen Wang (ed.)

[[File:Portrait of Henry George Liddell.jpg|thumb|Henry Liddell, in an 1858 portrait]]

'''Henry George Liddell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|d|əl}};&lt;ref&gt;On p. 57, Naiditch quotes "a variant of the ''Balliol Rhymes'' (p. 29): 'I am the Dean, and this is Mrs Liddell: / She plays the first, and I the second fiddle.'" {{cite journal|last1=Naiditch|first1=P. G.|title=On Pronouncing the Names of Certain British Classical Scholars|journal=The Classical Journal|date=1993|volume=89|issue=1|pages=55–59|jstor=3297619}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 February 1811 – 18 January 1898) was [[Dean (college)|dean]] (1855–91) of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University]] (1870–74), headmaster (1846–55) of [[Westminster School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.allrefer.com/encyclopedia/L/Liddell.html Henry George Liddell, English Literature, 19th Century, Biographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308055818/http://reference.allrefer.com/encyclopedia/L/Liddell.html |date=8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (where a house is now named after him), author of ''A History of Rome'' (1855), and co-author (with [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]]) of the monumental work ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|9048162}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as "Liddell and Scott", which is still widely used by students of Greek. [[Lewis Carroll]] wrote ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' for Henry Liddell's daughter [[Alice Liddell|Alice]].

==Biography==

Liddell received his education at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a [[British undergraduate degree classification|double first]] degree in 1833, then became a college tutor, and was ordained in 1838.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Liddell, Henry George|volume=16|page=588}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HenryLiddell.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Henry Liddell, in an 1891 portrait by [[Hubert von Herkomer|Sir Hubert von Herkomer]]]]
Liddell was Headmaster of [[Westminster School]] from 1846 to 1855. Meanwhile, his life work, the great [[lexicon]] (based on the German work of [[Franz Passow]]), which he and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] began as early as 1834, had made good progress, and the first edition of ''Liddell and Scott's Lexicon'' appeared in 1843. It immediately became the standard Greek–English dictionary, with the 8th edition published in 1897.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

As Headmaster of Westminster Liddell enjoyed a period of great success, followed by trouble due to the outbreak of fever and cholera in the school. In 1855 he accepted the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. In the same year he brought out his ''History of Ancient Rome'' and took a very active part in the first Oxford University Commission. His tall figure, fine presence and aristocratic mien were for many years associated with all that was characteristic of Oxford life. Coming just at the transition period when the "old Christ Church," which [[Edward Bouverie Pusey|Pusey]] strove so hard to preserve, was inevitably becoming broader and more liberal, it was chiefly due to Liddell that necessary changes were effected with the minimum of friction. 

In 1859 Liddell welcomed the then [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] when he matriculated at Christ Church, being the first holder of that title who had matriculated since [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; While Liddell was Dean of Christ Church, he arranged for the building of a new choir school and classrooms for the staff and pupils of [[Christ Church Cathedral School]] on its present site. Before then the school was housed within Christ Church itself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In July 1846, Liddell married Lorina Reeve (1826-1910), with whom he had nine children including [[Alice Liddell]] (1852-1934) of [[Lewis Carroll]] fame.

In conjunction with Sir [[Henry Acland]], Liddell did much to encourage the study of art at Oxford, and his taste and judgment gained him the admiration and friendship of [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]. In 1891, owing to advancing years, he resigned the deanery. The last years of his life were spent at [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]], where he died on 18 January 1898.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Two roads in Ascot, Liddell Way and Carroll Crescent honour the relationship between Henry Liddell and Lewis Carroll.

==Anecdotes==
[[File:Liddell caricature.jpg|thumb|upright|Liddell as caricatured by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|'Ape']] in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1875)]]
Liddell was an Oxford "character" in later years. He figures in contemporary undergraduate [[doggerel]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life | first=Robin | last=Wilson | authorlink=Robin Wilson (mathematician) | publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] | location= UK | year=2008 | isbn=978-0141016108 | page=83 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7Pk1HLZkIwC&amp;pg=PT83&amp;lpg=PT83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|

She plays first, I, second fiddle.&lt;br/&gt;
She is the Broad,&lt;br/&gt;
I am the High –&lt;br/&gt;
We are the University.}}

The Victorian journalist, [[George W. E. Russell]] (1853–1919), conveys something of Liddell's image:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography | year=1914 | page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Vice-Chancellor who matriculated me [1872] was the majestic Liddell, who, with his six feet of stately height draped in scarlet, his 'argent aureole' of white hair, and his three silver maces borne before him, always helped me to understand what [[Sydney Smith]] meant when he said, of some nonsensical proposition, that no power on earth, save and except the Dean of Christ Church, should induce him to believe it.}}

==Parents and grandparents==
His father was Henry Liddell, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Easington, County Durham|Easington]] (1787–1872), the younger son of [[Sir Henry Liddell, 5th Baronet]] (1749–1791) and the former Elizabeth Steele. His father's elder brother, [[Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth|Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet]] (1775–1855), was raised to the [[Peerage]] as [[Baron Ravensworth]] in 1821.

His mother was the former Charlotte Lyon (1785–1871), a daughter of Thomas Lyon (1741–1796) (who was the youngest son of the [[Thomas Lyon, 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]) and the former Mary Wren (died 1811).

==Marriage and children==

On 2 July 1846, Henry married Lorina Reeve (3 March 1826 – 25 June 1910). They were parents of ten children:

* Edward Harry Liddell (6 September 1847 – 14 June 1911).

'''Hereward Thimbleby Price''' (1880–1964) was an [[England|English]] [[author]] and [[Professor]] of [[English language|English]] at the [[University of Michigan]].

Price was born in a small town in [[Madagascar]] named [[Ambatolahinandrianisiahana]] as a son of an English missionary. Returning to England he was educated at various private schools, and in 1899 he was matriculated at the [[University of Oxford]]. During this time he also worked as an assistant in the creation of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. In 1904 he was appointed lecturer for English at the University of [[Bonn]], where he wrote and published his thesis ''A history of ablaut in the strong verbs from Caxton to the end of the Elizabethan period'' (1910). While living in [[Germany]], Price was drafted into the army during [[World War I]]. He was captured by [[Russia]]n soldiers, but escaped to [[China]]. In 1919 he wrote a book about his experiences called ''Boche and Bolshevik: Experiences of an Englishman in the German Army and in Russian Prisons''.

After coming to [[United States|America]] and gaining a professorship, he wrote many other books, including ''Foreign influences on Middle English'', and ''Construction in Shakespeare''. Price died in [[Washington D.C.]] in 1964.

A '''hierarchical query''' is a type of [[Select (SQL)|SQL query]] that handles [[hierarchical model]] data. They are special cases of more general recursive fixpoint queries, which compute [[transitive closure]]s.

In standard [[SQL:1999]] hierarchical queries are implemented by way of recursive ''[[#Common table expression|common table expressions]]'' (CTEs). Unlike Oracle's earlier [[#CONNECT BY|connect-by clause]], recursive CTEs were designed with [[fixpoint]] semantics from the beginning.&lt;ref name="JimMelton1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Melton|author2=Alan R. Simon|title=SQL:1999: Understanding Relational Language Components|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyhXvU0Eyg0C&amp;pg=PA352|year=2002|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-456-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recursive CTEs from the standard were relatively close to the existing implementation in [[IBM DB2]] version 2.&lt;ref name="JimMelton1"/&gt; Recursive CTEs are also supported by [[Microsoft SQL Server]] (since SQL Server 2008 R2),&lt;ref name="msdnRCTEs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186243.aspx |title=Recursive Queries Using Common Table Expressions |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird 2.1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://firebirdsql.org/rlsnotesh/rlsnotes210.html#rnfb210-cte |title=Firebird 2.1 Release Notes |author=Helen Borrie |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL 8.4+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/queries-with.html |title=WITH Queries}} PostgreSQL&lt;/ref&gt; [[SQLite|SQLite 3.8.3+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html |title=WITH Clause}} SQLite&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM Informix]] version 11.50+, [[CUBRID]] and [[MySQL|MySQL 8.0.1+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-labs-recursive-common-table-expressions-in-mysql-ctes/ |title=MySQL 8.0 Labs: [Recursive] Common Table Expressions in MySQL (CTEs)}} mysqlserverteam.com&lt;/ref&gt;. Tableau and TIBCO Spotfire do not support CTEs, while Oracle 11g Release 2's implementation lacks fixpoint semantics.

Without common table expressions or connected-by clauses it is possible to achieve hierarchical queries with user-defined recursive functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paragoncorporation.com/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=24 Paragon corporation: Using PostgreSQL User-Defined Functions to solve the Tree Problem], February 15, 2004, accessed September 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common table expression ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
A common table expression, or CTE, (in [[SQL]]) is a temporary named result set, derived from a simple query and defined within the execution scope of a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; statement.

CTEs can be thought of as alternatives to derived tables ([[subquery]]), [[view (database)|views]], and inline user-defined functions.

Common table expressions are supported by [[Teradata]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]], [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Comparison of relational database management systems#Database capabilities]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] (with recursion since 11g release 2), [[PostgreSQL]] (since 8.4), [[MariaDB]] (since 10.2), [[MySQL]] (since 8.0), [[SQLite]] (since 3.8.3), [[HSQLDB|HyperSQL]] and [[H2 (DBMS)|H2]] (experimental).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#recursive_queries&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle calls CTEs "subquery factoring".&lt;ref name="MortonSands2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Morton|author2=Robyn Sands|author3=Jared Still|author4=Riyaj Shamsudeen |author5=Kerry Osborne|title=Pro Oracle SQL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrwu-f4JwjcC&amp;pg=PA283|year=2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3228-5|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syntax for a recursive CTE is as follows:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
WITH [RECURSIVE] with_query [, ...]
SELECT...
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;with_query&lt;/code&gt;‘s syntax is:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
query_name [ (column_name [,...]) ] AS (SELECT ...)
&lt;/source&gt;

Recursive CTEs (or "recursive subquery factoring"&lt;ref name="MortonSands2010b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Morton|author2=Robyn Sands|author3=Jared Still|author4=Riyaj Shamsudeen |author5=Kerry Osborne|title=Pro Oracle SQL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrwu-f4JwjcC&amp;pg=PA304|year=2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3228-5|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oracle jargon) can be used to traverse relations (as graphs or trees) although the syntax is much more involved because there are no automatic pseudo-columns created (like &lt;code&gt;LEVEL&lt;/code&gt; above); if these are desired, they have to be created in the code. See MSDN documentation&lt;ref name="msdnRCTEs"/&gt; or IBM documentation&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/topic/com.ibm.db2z9.doc.apsg/src/tpc/db2z_xmprecursivecte.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r4/index.jsp?topic=%2Fsqlp%2Frbafyrecursivequeries.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for tutorial examples.

The &lt;code&gt;RECURSIVE&lt;/code&gt; keyword is not usually needed after WITH in systems other than PostgreSQL.&lt;ref name="ObeHsu2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Regina Obe|author2=Leo Hsu|title=PostgreSQL: Up and Running|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jkIZkMTPcC&amp;pg=PA94|year=2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-1-4493-2633-3|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SQL:1999 a recursive (CTE) query may appear anywhere a query is allowed. It's possible, for example, to name the result using &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; [&lt;code&gt;RECURSIVE&lt;/code&gt;] &lt;code&gt;VIEW&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Melton|author2=Alan R. Simon|title=SQL:1999: Understanding Relational Language Components|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyhXvU0Eyg0C&amp;pg=PA352|year=2002|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-456-8|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a CTE inside an &lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO&lt;/code&gt;, one can populate a table with data generated from a recursive query; random data generation is possible using this technique without using any procedural statements.&lt;ref name="ChamberlinChamberlin1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Don Chamberlin|title=A Complete Guide to DB2 Universal Database|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hb4zskzHrWYC&amp;pg=PA253|year=1998|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-482-7|pages=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Databases, like PostgreSQL, support a shorter CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW format which is internally translated into WITH RECURSIVE coding.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a recursive query computing the [[factorial]] of numbers from 0 to 9 is the following:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
WITH RECURSIVE temp (n, fact) AS 
(SELECT 0, 1 -- Initial Subquery
  UNION ALL 
 SELECT n+1, (n+1)*fact FROM temp -- Recursive Subquery 
        WHERE n &lt; 9)
SELECT * FROM temp;
&lt;/source&gt;

== CONNECT BY ==

An alternative syntax is the non-standard &lt;code&gt;CONNECT BY&lt;/code&gt; construct; it was introduced by Oracle in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Oracle 10g, the construct was only useful for traversing acyclic graphs because it returned an error on detecting any cycles; in version 10g Oracle introduced the NOCYCLE feature (and keyword), making the traversal work in the presence of cycles as well.&lt;ref name="MishraBeaulieu2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanjay Mishra|author2=Alan Beaulieu|title=Mastering Oracle SQL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5vbGgz7TFsC&amp;pg=PT227|year=2004|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-0-596-00632-7|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;code&gt;CONNECT BY&lt;/code&gt; is supported by [[EnterpriseDB]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisedb.com/documentation/hierarchical-queries.html Hierarchical Queries], EnterpriseDB&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oracle database]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/queries003.htm Hierarchical Queries], Oracle&lt;/ref&gt; [[CUBRID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CUBRID Hierarchical Query|url=http://www.cubrid.org/manual/841/en/Hierarchical%20Query|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM Informix]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.sqls.doc/ids_sqs_2033.htm Hierarchical Clause], IBM Informix&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IBM DB2|DB2]] although only if it is enabled as a compatibility mode.&lt;ref name="Gennick2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Gennick|title=SQL Pocket Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEAFRzMe_SMC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-9409-7|page=8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syntax is as follows:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
 SELECT select_list
 FROM table_expression
 [ WHERE ... ]
 [ START WITH start_expression ]
 CONNECT BY [NOCYCLE] { PRIOR child_expr = parent_expr | parent_expr = PRIOR child_expr }
 [ ORDER SIBLINGS BY column1 [ ASC | DESC ] [, column2 [ ASC | DESC ] ] ...
 [ GROUP BY ... ]
 [ HAVING ... ]
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

;For example,

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
 SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr "manager"
 FROM emp START WITH mgr IS NULL
 CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr;

&lt;/source&gt;

The output from the above query would look like:

  level |  employee   | empno | manager
 -------+-------------+-------+---------

      2 |   JONES     |  7566 |    7839

&lt;source lang="oracle11"&gt;
   SELECT ename "Employee", CONNECT_BY_ROOT ename "Manager",
   LEVEL-1 "Pathlen", SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(ename, '/') "Path"
   FROM emp

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">'''Horatio Mosley Moule''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|l}} (1832&amp;ndash;1873) was the fourth son of [[Anglican]] priest and inventor [[Henry Moule]], and is best remembered as a friend of [[Thomas Hardy]]. He was generally known as '''Horace''', to distinguish him from his Uncle Horatio, after whom he was named.

==Early life==
Moule was born on 30 May 1832 at [[Fordington, Dorset]], where his father was [[vicar]]. In 1851 he entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]], but left without a degree; in 1854 he entered [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], but did not get a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] until 1867 and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= ML854HM|name=Moule, Horace Mosley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, win the [[John Hulse|Hulsean Prize]] in 1858.

==Career==
He spent a brief spell as an assistant master at [[Marlborough College]], and then became a government inspector of [[workhouse]]s.

==Personal life==
Moule appears to have suffered from [[Depression (clinical)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]], and his life and death were shaped by these character traits; one of his pupils recorded in his diary that Horace was 'a [[dipsomaniac]]-and that he was suffering from [[Delirium tremens|D.T]]'.

===Death===
On 21 September 1873, when deeply depressed and affected by alcohol, he ended a three-hour conversation at Queens' with his brother [[Charles Walter Moule|Charles]] and went to bed. Minutes later Charles, writing in an adjoining room, heard what he described as a "trickling" sound and went to investigate. He found Horace covered in blood but conscious and able to utter his last words "Easy to die. Love to my mother", having slashed his throat with the razor that he kept under his pillow for that very purpose. The inquest jury returned a verdict of [[suicide]] whilst temporarily insane, and he was buried at Fordington.

==Hardy==
Some of Hardy's poems were dedicated to Moule, and it has been suggested that several characters and scenes in his novels were inspired by him. Henry Knight in ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' shares many of Moule's character traits.

'''IANAL''' is a [[Usenet]] and [[Online chat|chat]] abbreviation ([[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]]) for the expansion "'''I am not a lawyer'''".&lt;ref name="Wacha"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion may be used by non-lawyers who are seeking to avoid accusations of [[unauthorized practice of law]] and are not making any recommendation to the particular addressee of their remarks.

A related abbreviation, '''TINLA''', stands for "This is not legal advice." One or both of these expansions often precede opinions about [[law]].&lt;ref name="Wacha"/&gt; The use of these expansions serves as a warning for the reader not to take the opinion as professional legal advice. Many jurisdictions have legal restrictions on actually giving or even appearing to give legal advice, or otherwise practicing as a [[lawyer]] without legal qualifications and official registration. Rendition of legal advice by a person who is not licensed to do so can be the basis for a charge of [[unauthorized practice of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Origin and usage ==
The term appears to be inspired by a 1980s commercial for [[Vicks]] Formula 44 cough syrup, in which two spokesmen successively pitched the [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] medication with the line: "I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV."&lt;ref name="Zwicky"&gt;{{cite web

A variant of IANAL is '''IANYL''' ("I am not ''your'' lawyer"). The term may be used by a lawyer posting comments on a message board to indicate that the commentator is, in fact, a lawyer, but to emphasize that the commentator does not represent the reader, and to indicate that the comments are not protected by [[attorney–client privilege]] and that the commenter disclaims any [[malpractice]] or other [[tort]] liability should the suggestion be followed with undesirable results. '''IAAL''' ("I am a lawyer") is sometimes used as well, usually with an explicit disclaimer such as "IAAL, but I'm not your lawyer".{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The [[case law]] standard for determining what comments cross the line is generally "the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice". Attorneys may use a disclaimer to reduce confusion, and "I am not your lawyer" is part of a typical disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|quote=An attorney who wants to respond to a chat room question should not give legal advice until the attorney and would-be client have explicitly discussed or created an attorney-client relationship.... Otherwise, the attorney needs to use a written disclaimer in the chat room, stating something like, "This information is given for legal education only. It may not work for your specific situation. It is not legal advice, and I am not your lawyer. You have to find your own local lawyer to get legal advice and help with your problem."
|accessdate=2008-01-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are "weighty obligations" that go along with the creation of a lawyer–client relationship, particularly if an "online exchange includes legal advice relating to the client's specific facts". Courts have held that (in the case of [[900 number]]s) [[Standard form contract|boilerplate]] disclaimers without clear actions to indicate assent may not avoid the creation of a lawyer–client relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Variations of IANAL can be applied to different fields, such as '''IANAMD''' for "I am not a [[Medical Doctor]]" or '''IANAP''' for "I am not a [[physicist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=963459&amp;cid=24998529 |title=Tying knots with light |publisher=science.slashdot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expansions serve the same general purpose as IANAL{{snd}}to discourage the use of the information as professional advice.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6990">'''International Classification for Standards''' ('''ICS''') is an international classification system for [[standardization|technical standards]]. It is designed to cover every economic sector and virtually every activity of the humankind where technical [[standardization|standards]] may be used.

Developed and maintained by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the ICS is intended to be a continuous work in progress and is updated when necessary.  The latest edition of the ICS can be downloaded free of charge from the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] web site.

Anyone may submit a proposal for modifications or additions to the ICS.

== Purpose ==
The ICS serves as a structure for catalogues and [[database]]s of [[standardization|technical standards]] and other normative documents, and as a basis for standing-order systems for international, regional and national standards.

== Classification principles ==
The ICS uses an hierarchical classification, which consists of three nested levels called ''fields'' (Level 1), ''groups'' (Level 2) and ''sub-groups'' (Level 3). Each ''field'' is subdivided into ''groups'', which are further divided into ''sub-groups''.

All classification levels are designated by a classification code (called ''notation'') and a title. The notation is a set of [[Arabic numeral]]s.

Top-level items, which have no parent levels, use a two-digit notation, for example:
:&lt;code&gt;''43 ROAD VEHICLE ENGINEERING''&lt;/code&gt;

The notations for ''groups'' and ''sub-groups'' include the parent-level notations. The example below shows a notation for Sub-Group 20 (Level 3), which belongs to Group 040 (Level 2) in Field 43 (Level 1). 
:&lt;code&gt;''43.040.20 Lighting, signaling and warning devices''&lt;/code&gt;

=== Level 1 (Fields) ===

A ''field'' is the first level in the International Classification for Standards. It may represent one or a combination of the following:
*'''A sector''' of the economy such as [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[construction]] or the [[packaging]] industry;
*'''A technology''' such as [[telecommunications]] or [[food technology|food processing]];
*'''An activity''' such as [[environment protection]], [[safety]] assurance and protection of [[public health]];
*'''A field of science''' such as [[mathematics]] or [[astronomy]].

At present the classification includes 40 ''fields''.

:01  Generalities. Terminology. Standardization. Documentation

:03  Services. Company Organization, Management And Quality. Administration. Transport. Sociology

:07  Mathematics. Natural Sciences

:11  Health Care Technology

:13  Environment. Health Protection. Safety

:17  Metrology And Measurement. Physical Phenomena

:19  Testing

:21  Mechanical Systems And Components For General Use

:23  Fluid Systems And Components For General Use

:25  Manufacturing Engineering

:27  Energy And Heat Transfer Engineering

:29  Electrical Engineering

:31  Electronics

:43  Road Vehicles Engineering

:45  Railway Engineering

:47  Shipbuilding And Marine Structures

:49  Aircraft And Space Vehicle Engineering

:53  Materials Handling Equipment

:55  Packaging And Distribution Of Goods

:59  Textile And Leather Technology

:61  Clothing Industry

:85  Paper Technology

:87  Paint And Colour Industries

:91  Construction Materials And Building

:93  Civil Engineering

:95  Military Engineering

:97  Domestic And Commercial Equipment. Entertainment. Sports

===Level 2 (Groups) ===

The ICS second level, the ''group'', is a subdivision of the ''field''.

=== Level 3 (Sub-Groups) ===

''Sub-groups'' are used in the ICS to subdivide ''groups'' into subjects that certain to a particular aspect of the subject covered by a given ''group''. Regardless of the subject, virtually all ''groups'' include a ''sub-group'' No. 01 that covers the complete subject of the respective ''group''. In addition, most of the ''groups'' contain a ''sub-group'' No. 99 for standards on subjects which do not correspond either to the subjects of the general ''sub-groups'' or to the subjects of the specific ''sub-groups'' of the respective ''groups''.

=== Level 4 (Units) ===

Level 4 subdivisions are not part of the official ICS document. The ICS rules however allow users of the classification system to subdivide the official ICS ''sub-groups'' into so-called ''units'', making them a Level 4 component of the International Classification for Standards. This is accomplished by adding a two-digit number to the notation of the ''sub-group'' being subdivided. However, instead of a period, new notations use a [[hyphen]] as a separator. For example:
:&lt;code&gt;''35.220.20-10 Magnetic  tapes''&lt;/code&gt;

== Statistics ==
*The International Classification for Standards has 99 top-level divisions of which only 40 are presently used. The remaining 59 divisions are reserved for topics that are not yet known.
*There are three "official" levels in the ICS system, each holding ninety nine (99), nine hundred and ninety nine (999) and ninety nine (99) subsets, respectively.
*Each ''field'' of the ICS is designed to hold a maximum of 999 ''groups''.
*Although any ''group'' in the ICS may contain no more than 99 "official" ''sub-groups'', the holding capacity of the ''group'' can be expanded 99 times by using "unofficial" Level 4 subdivisions, an option that is built into the ICS. Adding Level 4 subdivisions to all ''sub-groups'' within a ''group'' increases the ''group's'' holding capacity to 9 801 subjects.
*The expanded version of the International Classification for Standards is capable of covering nearly 1 billion subjects (969,328,701 to be exact). This can be achieved without any restructuring of its numerical coding system. Since there are currently about 780 000 national standards in the world, the number of subjects that the ICS can offer for classification purposes exceeds 1 200 times the total number of documents that are available for classification.

The country in which a [[motor vehicle]]'s [[vehicle registration plate]] was issued may be indicated by an '''international licence plate country code''', formerly known as an '''International Registration Letter'''&lt;ref&gt;See Georgano, G. N. and Andersen, Thorkil Ry; ''The New encyclopedia of motorcars, 1885 to the present''; p. 18 {{ISBN|0525932542}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''International Circulation Mark.'''&lt;ref&gt;See Harding, Anthony and Bird, Anthony; ''Guinness Book of Car Facts and Feats: A Record of Everyday Motoring and Automotive Achievements''; p. 243. {{ISBN|0851122078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate, or be incorporated into the [[vehicle registration plate]].

The allocation of codes is maintained by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] as the ''Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic''&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/Distsigns.pdf ''Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic''], 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes abbreviated to DSIT), authorised by the UN's [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention of Road Traffic signed at Geneva September, 19 1949 - Annex 4. Distinguishing Sign of Vehicles in International Traffic|url=http://www.adcidl.com/Annex-4-Distinguishing-Sign-of-Vehicles-in-International-Traffic.html|website=Auto Driver Club|publisher=NYS ZONE INC.|accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1949 and the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on Road Traffic on 8 November 1968 - Index Page|url=http://www.international-driving-permit.com/Convention-on-Road-Traffic/8-November-1968/EN/index.aspx|website=Auto Driver Club|publisher=NYS ZONE INC.|accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1968. Many vehicle codes created since the adoption of [[ISO 3166]] coincide with ISO two- or three-letter codes.

The 2004 South-East Asian ''Agreement&amp;nbsp;... for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People'' uses a mixture of ISO and DSIT codes: Myanmar uses MYA, China CHN, and Cambodia KH (ISO codes), Thailand uses T (DSIT code), Laos LAO, and Vietnam VN (coincident ISO and DSIT codes).&lt;ref name="Annex2_2004"&gt;[http://www1.mt.gov.vn/hotrovantai/uploads/2006/E_annex_2.pdf ''Agreement between and among the Governments of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar, the Kingdom of Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People, Annex 2: Registration of Vehicles in International Traffic'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071234/http://www1.mt.gov.vn/hotrovantai/uploads/2006/E_annex_2.pdf |date=March 4, 2012 }}, 2004 (also here {{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/GMS-Agreement/annex2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607012937/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/GMS-Agreement/annex2.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }} and here {{cite web|url=http://www.news.mot.go.th/iba_website/fileupload/Annex2_Registration%20of%20Vehicles%20in%20International%20Traffic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731055859/http://www.news.mot.go.th/iba_website/fileupload/Annex2_Registration%20of%20Vehicles%20in%20International%20Traffic.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-31 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] was concluded in Vienna on 8 November 1968. Since its entry into force on 21 May 1977, in signatory countries it replaces previous road traffic conventions, notably the 1949 [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]], in accordance with its Article 48. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. When driving in other signatory countries, the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate as a white oval plate or sticker, or be incorporated in the [[vehicle registration plate]]. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated in the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle.
* The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex 3 of the Vienna Convention, which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an [[ellipse]] with the [[major axis]] horizontal. The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.
* When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs. The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right of the registration plate. When a symbol, flag or emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall be placed on the far left of the plate. The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so as to be easily identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility. The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different colour from the registration number, or have a different background colour from that reserved for the registration number, or be clearly separated from the registration number, preferably with a line.
The requirement to display a separate distinguishing sign is not necessary within the [[European Economic Area]], for vehicles with license plates in [[Vehicle registration plates of the European Union|the common EU format]] which satisfy the requirements of the Vienna Convention, and so are also valid in non-EU countries signatory to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:299:0001:0003:EN:PDF|title=Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98|date=3 November 1998|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate signs are also not needed for Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the province, state or district of registration is usually embossed or surface-printed on the vehicle registration plate.

There are unofficial codes in common use, such as "CYM" for [[Wales]], "BZH" for [[Brittany]], "VL" for [[Flanders]], "V" for [[Vojvodina]]/[[Vajdaság]], "TS" for [[Transylvania]],"PR" for [[Puerto Rico]], "SIC" for [[Székely Land]] (from Latin ''Terra Siculorum'') and "CD" for "Corps Diplomatique".

In addition, in some areas, vehicle-style stickers have been used to denote and promote other entities, such as towns, islands, businesses, and even associations.  These irregular stickers almost always bear an explanation of the code in small print near the edge of the sticker, as the codes used are so unknown.

==Diplomatic licence plate codes==
A separate system is used for vehicles belonging to the diplomats of foreign countries with license plate from the host country. That system is host country-specific and varies largely from country to country. For example '''TR''' on a diplomatic car in the USA indicates Italian, not Turkish. Such markings in Norway are indicated with numbers only, again different from international standards (e.g. '''90''' means Slovakian.

The '''''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''''' (frequently abbreviated '''MGH''' in bibliographies and lists of sources) is a comprehensive series of carefully edited and published [[primary source]]s, both [[chronicle]] and [[Archives|archival]], for the study of [[History of Germany|German history]] (broadly conceived) from the end of the [[Roman Empire]] to 1500.&lt;ref name=Holland1910&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.).  The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]] (1795–1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]] (1813-1886) .

==History==
The MGH was founded in Hanover as a private [[text publication society]] by the [[Prussia]]n reformer [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]]. Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, ''Sanctus amor patriae dat animum'' ("Holy love for the fatherland gives the spirit") is explained as linking [[Romantic nationalism]] with professional scholarship. In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in [[Berlin]]. 

In 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the ''Reichsinstitut für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde'' (National Institute for Older German History). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of [[World War II]]. 

However, the institute was subsequently revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings.&lt;!--Inhaltlich deckt die Bibliothek bzw. der frei zugängliche OPAC die mittelalterliche Geschichte Deutschlands und Europas mit Berücksichtigung der Kirchengeschichte ab. Der OPAC weist neben 130.000 Monographien auch ca. 150.000 unselbständige Schriften nach.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bib-bvb.de/bib_schule/infoblatt4-geschichte-theologie.pdf |title=BibliotheksVerbund Bayern |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721100240/http://www.bib-bvb.de/bib_schule/infoblatt4-geschichte-theologie.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moved into its current premises in the building of the [[Bavarian State Library]] in 1967.

The project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.

==Divisions==
The series falls into five main divisions, ''Antiquitates'', ''Diplomata'', ''Epistolae'', ''Leges'' and ''Scriptores'', with an additional smaller division of ''Necrologia''. Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use (''Scriptores in usum scholarum'') and special studies (''MGH Schriften'').

[[Image:Navestopicalbible.JPG|thumb|Nave's Topical Bible]]
'''Nave's Topical Bible''' is a book written by [[Orville Nave|Orville James Nave]] (1841–1917) and published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]. Nave was a chaplain in the United States Army and referred to his work as "the result of fourteen years of delight and untiring study of the Word of God." &lt;ref name="christianity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.christianity.com/Concordances/|title= Nave's Topical Bible|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topical [[concordance of the Bible]], and contains Biblical references to over 20,000 topics. Scripture is quoted over 100,000 times; the same Scripture citation may appear under several headings.

The topic headings are broad, covering many religious concepts, geographical regions, and names of Biblical figures. While [[theological]] concepts such as [[salvation]] and [[worship]] are included, a wide range of topics, such as Biblical references to [[rope]]s, are also included. This reflects the author's intention, as stated in the book's [[preface]], to "...note and classify everything found in the Scriptures".

The book took fourteen years to complete. Its original copyrights were 1896 and 1897. Until at least 1907 the book was published by the Topical Bible Publishing Company of Lincoln Nebraska. At least seven editions have been published, based on the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Version]] of the Bible. Each verse of the Bible is indexed according to the topics it is classified under. Christian figures such as [[Billy Graham]] have endorsed the book.

'''''Nordisk familjebok''''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈnuːɖɪsk fa²mɪlːjɛˌbuːk|lang}}, "Nordic Family Book") is a [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[encyclopedia]] that was published in print form between 1876 and 1957, and that is now fully available in digital form via [[Project Runeberg]] at [[Linköping University]].

== History ==
===Print editions===
[[File:nf1ed.svg|thumb|left|First edition (1876-1899), featuring [[Idun]] logo.]]
[[File:nfugglan.svg|thumb|The Owl Edition (1904-1926), featuring its namesake as its logo.]]
The first edition of ''Nordisk familjebok'' was published in 20 volumes between 1876 and 1899, and is known as the "Idun edition" because it bears a picture of [[Idun]], the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythologic]] goddess of spring and rejuvenation, on its cover.&lt;ref name="runeberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/#preface|title=Nordisk familjebok|date=30 December 1876|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://runeberg.org/katalog.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/katalog.html|title=Alphabetic catalog by title|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was published during almost a quarter of a century, and particularly the first ten volumes contain material which are not seen in later editions. A good example of this is found in the end of the [[Berlin]] article (which is included in the second volume, from 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/#band|title=Nordisk familjebok|date=30 December 1876|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where the author finishes his article by talking about the public decency and morality, which he finds to be very poor. The author continues by complaining about there being a very lazy interest in religious matters and concludes: "to all these joint circumstances, one can hardly defend oneself against the thought of future threatening dangers".&lt;ref&gt;Last 8-9 lines in the right column (322) Just before article on "'''Berlin''', Nils Johan" http://runeberg.org/nfab/0169.html ("Berlin" or "Bärlin" is a Swedish family name)&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition, popularly known as ''Uggleupplagan'' ("The [[Owl]] Edition") because of an owl image on its cover, was published between 1904 and 1926 in 38 volumes, and is the most comprehensive encyclopedia published in the Swedish language.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} 
&lt;ref name="runeberg.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://runeberg.org/katalog.html"/&gt;

The third edition had 17 volumes and was published between 1924 and 1937. Another three supplementary volumes were published in 1937, 1938 and in 1939. The supplement covers for instance the [[Spanish Civil War]] and a heavy update on [[Adolf Hitler]], but nothing about [[German invasion of Poland|Germany's war on Poland]] nor are [[World War II|later events mentioned]]. A second printing of the entire third edition was published between 1941 and 1944. Nothing essential is changed in the second printing, but quite a lot of one side portraits (still in black and white), coloured maps of "World cities", European countries, continents, Swedish provinces and cities are added together with a few topics, like a collection of national flags. All the added material are on unnumbered pages, presumably a technical printing solution (so already printed books did not require re-numbering). This edition is usually called "the 1930s edition" and are of brown colour when looking at them on a shelf.

[[Copyrights]] on the three first versions have expired, putting them in the [[public domain]];{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} while the fourth edition, from the 1950s, is still in copyright.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''''Orang-Outang, sive Homo Sylvestris: or, the Anatomy of a Pygmie Compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man''''' (1699) is a book by the British scientist [[Edward Tyson]]. Regarded as a seminal work on anatomy, this volume led to Tyson being known as the father of [[comparative anatomy]]. The book characterizes in detail the anatomy of a creature described as a ''pygmy'' (later known as a [[chimpanzee]]) and contains Tyson's views on the [[phylogeny]] of the pygmy and its relationship to humans, apes, and monkeys.

[[File:Anatomy of a pygmy.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Anatomy of a Pygmy'']]

The use of the phrase "orang-outang" does not refer to members of the [[orangutan]] genus ''Pongo'', but rather uses the phrase to refer to the habitat of the subject; that is, a "person of the forest" (''orangutan'' translates from Malay as "person of the forest/jungle".&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web| title = Orangutan | url = http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/orangutan.html| publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Due to the absence of previous literature concerning chimpanzees, it is not clear whether or not the titular subject was a [[bonobo]], ''Pan paniscus'', or a [[common chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'', as there was not great prior distinction between the two. Following his summary of the anatomy of the subject, Tyson attaches fours essays concerning the ancients' knowledge of [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pygmies]], [[cynocephali]], [[satyr]]s, and [[sphinges]].

The book was originally published in 1699 and was republished in 1894 with an introduction which contains a biography of Edward Tyson by Bertram C. A. Windle. Large portions of the book are block quotations in Latin of works from antiquity regarding the anatomy and socialization of the pygmy, much of which Tyson regarded as inaccurate myths and hearsay.

==Letter of dedication==
The letter of dedication is addressed to John Sommers, a Lord High Chancellor of England and President of the [[Royal Society]]. The letter thanks him for his dedication to the advancement of knowledge, specifically "experimental natural philosophy".

==Preface==
The preface consists of Tyson giving his reasons for conducting the study, "to find out the truth, than to enlarge in the mythology; to inform the judgement, than to please the fancy". He also laments his inability to compare his findings directly to apes and monkeys, instead having to rely on the works of others, such as [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Galen]], and [[Vesalius]]. Lastly he apologizes in advance for any mistakes on his part within the book.

==Organization==
The book itself is roughly divided into three parts containing Tyson's findings from his dissection of the pygmy and his comparison to previous findings, many of which are in Latin or Greek.

===Overview===
Tyson summarizes his observations on the external and internal anatomy of the pygmy, making note of their similarity or differences to humans. Most often he finds that the pygmy is different and "inferior" to humans, which is typical of the anthropocentrism of the time. Much of the text where he addresses previous findings are in Latin or Greek, although he does give explanations for why these authors' drew the conclusions they did, and why they are different or similar from his, in English.

===Skeleton===
This section is further subdivided into five sections, with much of the text being in Latin or Greek.

===Muscles===
This section is not divided, but addresses the musculature of the pygmy from head to feet.

===Synopsis===
Here Tyson gives the reader two lists, the first how the pygmy is more like a man than an ape, and the second how the pygmy is more like an ape than a man.

====Similarities====
A list of features Tyson found present in the pygmy which are more similar to a human than to an ape or a monkey; the terms use modern, common, anatomical terms which may differ from what is found in the book, but have been changed to ease the readers' understanding.

# Similar hair morphology of the shoulder and arm.
# Similar facial structure: forehead larger than the chin.
# The shape of the outer ear, except that the cartilage is thinner and more like an ape.
# Thicker fingers than an ape has.
# Primarily bipedal.
# Larger buttocks than an ape.
# Calf muscles.
# Wider in the shoulders and pectorals.
# Longer heel.
# Adipose membrane next to the skin.
# Unperforated peritoneum in the groin.
# Longer small intestine.
# Larger intestinal canal.
# Presence of a vermiform appendix;  beginning of the colon is not extended.
# Insertion of the bile and pancreatic ducts are in the same location. The ape also has this same location, but not a monkey.
# Longer large intestine.
# The liver is not divided into lobes (which humans do have; this differs from modern anatomical understanding).
# Similar bile vessels.
# Same spleen.
# Same pancreas.
# Same number of lobes in each lung.
# Pericardium attached to diaphragm.
# More rounded apex of the heart.
# No pouches in the chaps (unclear).
# Much larger brain than in apes, with the same structures as a human brain.
# More globular skull; twice as big as an ape's or monkey's.
# Same number of cranial sutures. Wormian (intra-sutural) bones also present (though not present in all humans).
# Cribriform plate and crista galli are present (present also in apes but not monkeys).
# Sella turcica is less prominent than in apes and monkeys.
# Pterygoid process present.
# Temporal and anterior fontanelle are different in monkeys (but not in apes).
# Zygomatic bone more similar to humans (smaller than in monkeys and apes).
# Shape of the teeth, especially the canines and molars.
# Transverse apophysis of C6 and C7 vertebra are more like a human's.
# Cervical vertebra lack foramen for containing the nerves (not the spinal cord, but rather peripheral nerves which travel to the rest of the body) which are present in monkeys.
# Number of thoracic and lumbar apophyses.
# Five vertebrae in the loins (could refer to lumbar vertebrae, of which monkey and apes have six).
# Lumbar vertebrae are straight.
# Five sacral elements; three in apes and monkeys.
# Four unperforated segments of the coccyx; monkeys have more.
# Seven true ribs which articulate in the body of the vertebrae; in apes and monkeys there are eight which articulate in the interstices of the vertebrae.
# Broad sternum; narrow in monkeys.
# Larger phalanges than in apes.
# Femur articulates and is shaped more like a human's.
# Round, single patella, not long and double like in an ape.
# Same heel, tarsals, and metatarsals as a human.
# Middle toe is not the longest, as it is in apes and monkeys.
# The obliquus capitis inferior, pyriformis, and biceps femoris are a human's. All other muscles are like the human's as well, but are not distinguishably different from an ape or monkey the same, either from lack of subject or previous observations.

{{Journalism sidebar}}
A '''press release''', '''news release''', '''media release''', '''press statement''' or '''video release''' is a written or recorded communication directed at members of the news media for the purpose of announcing something ostensibly newsworthy. Typically, they are mailed, [[fax]]ed, or e-mailed to assignment [[copy editing|editor]]s and [[Journalist|journalists]] at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, online media, television stations or television networks.

==Elements==
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation press release template.pdf|thumb|upright=1.1|An example of a press release, a Wikipedia press release template prepared by the Wikimedia Foundation communications team]]

Technically, anything deliberately sent to a reporter or media source is considered a press release: it is information released by the act of being sent to the media. However, public relations professionals often follow a standard format that they believe is efficient and increases their odds of getting the publicity they desire. The format is supposed to help journalists separate press releases from other PR communication methods, such as pitch letters or media advisories. Generally, a PR body consists of 4 to 5 paragraphs with word limit ranging from 400 to 500. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Geoffrey|title=How To Write a Press Release, with Examples|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-write-a-press-release-with-examples/|website=cbsnews.com|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, press releases can be anywhere from 300 to 800 words&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://service.prweb.com/resources/article/editorial-guidelines/|title=Editorial Guidelines for News Releases {{!}} PRWeb|website=PRWeb|access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the internet has gained prevalence, the way journalists like to be approached has also changed. A format suggested by Kristen Nicole, a former [[Mashable]] writer who is now the Senior Managing Editor of SiliconANGLE.com. is sending one sentence as to why this story works for my publication, and 5 bullet points for context. Kristen also recommends pitching writers directly over pitching editors saying: 

"I’d recommend pitching the writer first, with an angle specific to their beat. If a case needs to be made to the editor, it can fare better coming from the writer, who’s already had an opportunity to work out an angle with the PR rep. As an editor, I’m more likely to prioritize emails coming from those I have personal relationships with. These have been built over the years from the days when I was the writer presenting to my editors. Starting a new relationship with me as an editor, the most successful pitches have been those offering high profile interviews (editors that still write columns will want to take these for themselves before passing them off to junior writers) or highly specific content, like an original guest contribution."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pelt|first1=Mason|title=How to Get Press for Your Startup|url=http://tech.co/get-press-startup-2015-07|website=Tech.co|publisher=Tech.co|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these common structural elements include:

*'''[[Headline]]''' – used to grab the attention of journalists and briefly summarize the news.
*'''[[Dateline]]''' – contains the release date and usually the originating city of the press release. If the date listed is after the date that the information was actually sent to the media, then the sender is requesting a [[news embargo]], which journalists are under no obligation to honor.
*'''Introduction''' – first paragraph in a press release, that generally gives basic answers to the questions of who, what, when, where and why.
*'''Body''' – further explanation, statistics, background, or other details relevant to the news.
*'''Boilerplate''' – generally a short "about" section, providing independent background on the issuing company, organization, or individual.
*'''Close''' – in North America, traditionally the symbol "-30-" appears after the boilerplate or body and before the media contact information, indicating to media that the release has ended. A more modern equivalent has been the "###" symbol. In other countries, other means of indicating the end of the release may be used, such as the text "ends".
*'''Media contact information''' – name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or other contact information for the PR or other media relations contact person.

As the Internet has assumed growing prominence in the news cycle, press release writing styles have necessarily  evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/09/prweb2815314.htm |title=For Businesses Chasing Recognition, The Print Media Is Losing Its Allure | first=Ron | last=Goodden | publisher=PRWeb | date=1 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors of online newsletters, for instance, often lack the staff to convert traditional press release prose into more readable, print-ready copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newswirenext.com/press-release-to-blog-post/ |title=Transforming a promotional press release to a highly informative post | publisher=NewswireNext | date=5 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution models==
In the traditional distribution model, the business, political campaign, or other entity releasing information to the media hires a publicity agency to write and distribute written information to the [[newswire]]s.&lt;ref name=troyunderwood&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insideinvestorrelations.com/articles/financial-reporting/16166/wire-industry-feels-heat-self-publishing-tools-launch|title=Wire industry feels the heat as self-publishing tools launch|work=IR Magazine|first=Tim|last=Human|date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newswire then disseminates the information as it is received or as investigated by a [[journalist]].

An alternative is the ''self-published press release''.  In this approach, press releases are either sent directly to local [[newspapers]] or to free and paid distribution services.&lt;ref name=Socialmarketing&gt;{{cite news|last1=McQuivey|first1=James|title=Social, Content Marketing Strategies, Trends for 2015: EmailWire Press Release Distribution Services Presents Guides, eBooks|url=http://www.cmo.com.au/mediareleases/21244/social-content-marketing-strategies-trends-for/|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=CIO Magazine|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution service then provides the content, as-is, to their media outlets for publication which is usually online.

==Video news releases==
{{details|video news release}}

Some public relations firms send out video news releases (VNRs) which are pre-taped video programs that can be aired intact by TV stations. Often, the VNRs are aired without the stations' identifying or attributing them as such.

TV news viewers can often detect the use of VNRs within television newscasts; for example, many movie-star "interviews" are actually VNRs, taped on a set which is located at the movie studio and decorated with the movie's logo. Another frequent example of VNRs masquerading as news footage is videotapes of particular medical "breakthroughs," that are really produced and distributed by pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of selling new medicines.

Video news releases can be in the form of full blown productions costing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. They can also be in the TV news format, or even produced for the web.

Recently, many broadcast news outlets have discouraged the use of VNRs. Many stations, citing an already poor public perception, want to increase their credibility. Public relations companies are having a tougher time getting their pre-edited video aired.

VNRs can be turned into podcasts then posted onto newswires. Further to this, a story can be kept running longer by engaging "community websites", which are monitored and commented on by many journalists and features writers.

==Embargoing==
Sometimes a press release is distributed early and [[Embargo (journalism)|embargoed]] – that is, news organizations are requested not to report the story until a specified time. For instance, news organizations usually receive a copy of presidential speeches several hours in advance. Product or media [[reviewer]]s are commonly given a sample or preview of a product ahead of its release date.

Unless the journalist has voluntarily agreed to honor the embargo in advance, usually via a legally binding [[non-disclosure agreement]], the journalist is under no obligation to  it.  However, even in the absence of any obligation, news organizations generally do not break the embargo for sources that they wish to cultivate.  If they do, then the agency or client that sent the release may [[blacklist]] them.

== Positives ==
Press release material can be beneficial towards media corporations because releases help decrease costs and improve the amount of material a firm can output in a certain amount of time. Due to the material being pre-packaged, this saves journalists time, not only in writing a story, but also the time and money it would have taken to capture the news firsthand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Justin|last2=Williams|first2=Andrew|last3=Franklin|first3=Bob|date=2008-02-01|title=A Compromised Fourth Estate?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616700701767974|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/14616700701767974|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Negatives ==
Although the utilization of press release material can save a company time and money, it makes the distributed media boring and similar to the output of other firms. In the [[Information Age|digital age]], consumers want to get their information instantly and this puts pressure on media companies to output as much material as possible. This often causes them to heavily rely on the use of press releases in order to create their stories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Effects of press releases ==
Press releases are crucial from the point of view of public companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Shuba|last2=Pauwels|first2=Koen|last3=Silva-Risso|first3=Jorge|last4=Hanssens|first4=Dominique M|date=2013-05-29|title=Product Innovations, Advertising, and Stock Returns|url=http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.24?code=amma-site|journal=Journal of Marketing|language=en|volume=73|issue=1|pages=24–43|doi=10.1509/jmkg.73.1.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Primary Atomic Reference Clock in Space''' or '''PARCS''' was an [[atomic clock|atomic-clock]] mission scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2008, but cancelled to make way for the [[Vision for Space Exploration]].&lt;ref name="bremen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zarm.uni-bremen.de/2forschung/gravi/laemmerzahl/LaserRanging2005/speakers.htm |title=Lasers, Clocks, and Drag-Free technologies for Future Exploration in Space and Tests of Gravity: Speakers, Titles, Abstracts, References |accessdate=2008-01-17 |publisher=359th WE-Heraeus Seminar |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613082852/http://www.zarm.uni-bremen.de/2forschung/gravi/laemmerzahl/LaserRanging2005/speakers.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission, to have been funded by [[NASA]], involved a laser-cooled [[caesium]] atomic clock, and a time-transfer system using [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites. PARCS was to fly concurrently with the [[Superconducting Microwave Oscillator]] (SUMO)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ips.gov.au/IPSHosted/NCRS/wars/wars2002/proceedings/invited/print/tobar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a different type of clock that was to be compared against the PARCS clock to test certain theories. The objectives of the mission were to have been:

*Test [[Gravitation|gravitational theory]]
*Study laser-cooled [[atom]]s in [[microgravity]]
*Improve the accuracy of [[time]]keeping on earth

==Experiment location==
The proposed ISS location for the experiment was on the External Facility of the [[Japanese Experimental Module]] (JEM). This location afforded good views of the GPS constellation of [[satellite]]s, needed for comparing space and ground clocks. In addition, the volume, available power, and coolant system were well matched to the mission requirements.

==Goals==
The microgravity environment of space allows slowing of atoms to speeds well below those used in terrestrial atomic clocks, providing for substantial improvement in clock accuracy. This very accurate space clock will be compared continuously to the SUMO oscillator, and these two clocks (being fundamentally different) will provide a test of "[[local position invariance]]." Comparisons between the space and earth clocks will yield a related, but important measurement of the gravitational frequency shift. Finally, the signals conveyed to the ground through the GPS time-transfer system will serve as a truly international time standard available to anyone on earth.

==Institutions and people==
PARCS is a cooperative effort between the following organizations:

*[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), which contributed Flight Hardware Development
*[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), which contributed  Concept/Development Testing
*[[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], which contributed  Gravitational Testing

==Staff==
Bill Klipstein of JPL was the Project Scientist, and Dave Seidel of JPL was the Project Manager. The Co-Principal Investigators were Don Sullivan and Bill Phillips of NIST, and Neil Ashby of the University of Colorado. John Lipa of Stanford University was the Principal Investigator for SUMO and John Dick of JPL serves was the Project Scientist for that program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">A '''Publicly Available Specification''' or '''PAS''' is a standardization document that closely resembles a formal standard in structure and format but which has a different development model.&lt;ref name="Principles of PAS Standardization"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of PAS Standardization|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/standards/bs0-pas0/BSI-PAS0-Principles-of-PAS-UK-EN.pdf|website=www.bsigroup.com|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of a Publicly Available Specification is to speed up standardization. PASs are often produced in response to an urgent market need.&lt;ref name=IEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Publicly Available Specifications|url=http://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/publications/pas.htm|website=www.iec.ch|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[BSI Group]] develops PASs in the UK,&lt;ref name="Principles of PAS Standardization" /&gt; while the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] develops international PASs in the arena of electrical, electronic and related technologies,&lt;ref name=IEC /&gt; and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] develops international ISO PASs.&lt;ref name="ISO Deliverables"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO Deliverables|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/deliverables-all.htm?type=pas|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
BSI Group pioneered the PAS format. Under the BSI model, any organization, association or group who wish to document standardized best practice on a specific subject, can commission a PAS, subject to the [[BSI Group|BSI]] acceptance process.A [[British Standard]] and a PAS must reach full consensus between all stakeholders on technical content. The timescale for the development of a PAS can be shorter, typically around 8 months, and is why it is sometimes referred to as a 'fast-track standard'.&lt;ref name="Develop your own fast-track standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Develop your own fast-track standard|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/developing-new-standards/developing-a-pas/|website=www.bsigroup.com|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a PAS cannot conflict with, or contradict, existing or draft work within the formal standards arena and must complement, not conflict with, any legislation in the subject area.  It is also written in accordance with BS drafting rules, which means that the content must be technically robust and cannot be technically constrained (i.e. it cannot include patented or proprietary methods or products).  It is written unambiguously and with objectively verifiable requirements or recommendations.&lt;ref name="Principles of PAS Standardization" /&gt;

==Origin of term "PAS"==

[[File:PAS 003 Photo of Forward.jpg|100px|thumbnail|left]]
According to a BSI document [http://www.bsigroup.com/Documents/standards/bs0-pas0/BSI-PAS0-Principles-of-PAS-UK-EN.pdf "Principles of PAS standardization"] 
''"The term PAS was originally an acronym derived from "publicly available specification".  However, not all PAS documents are structured as specifications and the term is now sufficiently well established not to require any further amplification."''  
However, early examples of PAS were actually titled "Product Approval Specification" as illustrated in the accompanying photograph showing part of PAS 003.

==Company history==
[[Image:1880 spine Illinois State Gazetteer by Polk &amp; Co.png|thumb|100px|left|Polk's ''Illinois State Gazetteer'', 1880]]
R. L. Polk &amp; Company was founded by [[Ralph Lane Polk]] in 1870 in Detroit, MI as a publisher of business directories. In 1872, the company first published a City Directory, for Evansville, Indiana, plus a listing of post offices in nine states. Additional directories followed in the ensuing years as the business grew.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;[http://usa.polk.com/Company/Heritage/ R.L.

In 1921, a conversation between Ralph Lane Polk II and [[Alfred P. Sloan]] (who later became president of General Motors) helped fuel R. L. Polk &amp; Company's entry into the automotive industry. During the conversation, Sloan asked Polk to impartially tabulate and publish statistical information on cars and trucks in operation. R.L. Polk &amp; Company launched its motor vehicle statistical operations in 1922, when the first car registration reports were published.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071116145915/http://www.salesforce.com/customers/business-services/case-studies/rlpolk.jsp Retrieved on 11/4/08&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, R.L. Polk &amp; Co. published its first Passenger Car Registration Report, covering 58 makes and accounting for 9.2 million passenger automobiles on America's highways.

From 1951 to 1958, the company pioneered the use of electronic punch card tabulating equipment.

'''Reference.com''' is an [[online encyclopedia]] that organizes content that uses a question-and-answer format. Articles are organized into hierarchical categories.

Before [[IAC (company)|IAC]] restructered the site following an acquisition in 2008, Reference.com comprised multiple reference works, and disclosed its sources.

==History==
[[File:Reference-com logo.png|thumb|left|The old version of the Reference.com logo]]

Reference.com was launched by InReference, Inc in February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19088675.html|title=Reference.com Goes Live as the Most Comprehensive Internet Forums Service|date=3 February 1997|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was later acquired by Lexico Publishing Group, LLC. In 2005, Lexico announced that Reference.com would begin offering searches of [[Wikipedia]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexico.com/about/pr20050915.html|title=Reference.com Expands Content by Adding Wikipedia Encyclopedia to Search Capabilities|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|date=15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2007, the site typically ranked in the mid-200s among the most popular websites on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Alexa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Freference.com|title= Reference.com Traffic Details|publisher=[[Alexa.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[Dictionary.com]] had been greatly boosted by [[Google]]'s practice of offering a link at the top of their search results that goes to the Dictionary.com definition. This exclusive relationship was terminated without explanation to the public when the Google links were redirected to definitions at [[Answers.com]]. (In December 2009, the Answers.com links were replaced with Google's own dictionary.) Google added a Dictionary.com definition link for certain search words in a non-exclusive relationship (along with links to definitions from a few other commercial reference websites). On 3 July 2008, [[IAC (company)|IAC]] acquired Lexico Publishing Group, LLC and its three properties: Thesaurus.com, Reference.com, and Dictionary.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN0337985120080703?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=internetNews|title=Ask.com closes acquisition of Dictionary.com|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=3 July 2008 | first=Eric | last=Auchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8300-10784_3-7-0.html?keyword=Dictionary.com|title=Ask.com closes Dictionary.com deal|publisher=[[CNet]]|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site can also search [[Usenet]] groups and other [[mailing list]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/4239/new_web_service_provides_search_tool_for_usenet_and_more.html|title=New Web Service Provides Search Tool for Usenet and More|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=12 February 1997|author=Tracy Swedlow|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605225254/http://www.pcworld.com/article/4239/new_web_service_provides_search_tool_for_usenet_and_more.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/04/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-on-line-goodbye-to-seinfeld-or-good-riddance.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=4 January 1998|author=Anthony Ramirez|title=Neighborhood Report: New York Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia had articles from such sources as the 2004 ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', the ''Crystal Reference Encyclopedia'', and (later) the [[English Wikipedia]]. Its [[online dictionary]] indexed the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', ''[[Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary]]'', the [[Jargon File]], the ''Kernerman English Multilingual Dictionary'', [[Acronym Finder]], ''[[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]]'', ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary'', the ''On-line Medical Dictionary'', and ''[[WordNet]]''. Its [[thesaurus]] was based on multiple versions of ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]''. The site's [[web directory]] was an interface to the [[Open Directory Project]], and its [[web search]] feature used [[Google Search]]. An interface to [[Google Translate]] was added in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.reference.com/ |title=Translator – An Ask.com Service|access-date=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User tracking==
Reference.com in 2010 topped the list compiled by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' ranking websites by how many third-party tracking cookies were added to the user's computer. Reference.com added 234 tracking cookies when encountering a first-time user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Tracking The Companies That Track You Online |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129298003 |quote=The one site that installed the most was Dictionary.com.

So on Dictionary.com, the vast majority of the trackers (200 out of 234) were installed by companies that the person visiting the site probably had never heard of." |work=[[Fresh Air]]  |date=August 19, 2010 |access-date=14 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PortalSJR.JPG|thumb|Portal SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank screenshot]]

'''SCImago Journal Rank''' (SJR indicator) is a [[citation metric|measure]] of scientific influence of [[academic journal|scholarly journal]]s that accounts for both the number of [[citation]]s received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from. A journal's SJR is a numeric value indicating the average number of weighted citations received during a selected year per document published in that journal during the previous three years. Higher SJR values are meant to indicate greater journal prestige. 

The SJR indicator is a variant of the [[centrality|eigenvector centrality measure]] used in network theory. Such measures establish the importance of a node in a network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node. The SJR indicator has been developed to be used in extremely large and heterogeneous journal citation networks. It is a size-independent indicator and its values order journals by their "average prestige per article" and can be used for journal comparisons in science evaluation processes. The SJR indicator is a free journal metric inspired by, and using an algorithm similar to, [[PageRank]].

The ''SJR indicator'' provides an alternative to the [[impact factor]] (IF) or average citations per document in a 2-year period, abbreviated as "Cites per Doc. (2y)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080102/full/451006a.html | title= Free journal-ranking tool enters citation market | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date= 2 January 2008 | volume= 451 | issue= 6 | doi= 10.1038/451006a | author = Declan Butler | pmid= 18172465 | pages= 6 |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/short/22/8/2623 | title = Comparison of SCImago journal rank indicator with journal impact factor | author= Matthew E. Falagas| doi = 10.1096/fj.08-107938 | journal = [[The FASEB Journal]] | year = 2008 | issue = 22 | pages = 2623–2628 | pmid = 18408168 | volume = 22 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
If scientific impact is considered related to the number of endorsements, in the form of citations, a journal receives, then prestige can be understood as a combination of the number of endorsements and the prestige or importance of the journals issuing them. The ''SJR indicator'' assigns different values to citations depending on the importance of the journals where they come from. This way, citations coming from highly important journals will be more valuable and hence will provide more prestige to the journals receiving them. The calculation of the ''SJR indicator'' is very similar to the ''[[Eigenfactor]] score'', with the former being based on the [[Scopus]] database and the latter on the [[Web of Science]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank (SJR) as an alternative to Thomson Reuters's Impact Factor and EigenFactor | url=http://www.scimagojr.com/news.php?id=41 | date=21 Aug 2008 | accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computation ==
The SJR indicator computation is carried out using an iterative [[algorithm]] that distributes prestige values among the journals until a steady-state solution is reached. The SJR algorithm begins by setting an identical amount of prestige to each journal, then using an iterative procedure, this prestige is redistributed in a process where journals transfer their achieved prestige to each other through citations. The process ends up when the difference between journal prestige values in consecutive iterations do not reach a minimum threshold value any more. The process is developed in two phases, (a) the computation of ''Prestige SJR'' (''PSJR'') for each journal: a size-dependent measure that reflects the whole journal prestige, and (b) the normalization of this measure to achieve a size-independent measure of prestige, the ''SJR indicator''.&lt;ref name="DESCRIPTION OF SCIMAGO JOURNAL RANK INDICATOR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank|title=DESCRIPTION OF SCIMAGO JOURNAL RANK INDICATOR|url=http://www.scimagojr.com/SCImagoJournalRank.pdf|website=SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10949">A '''Segal–Cover score''' is an attempt to measure the "perceived qualifications and [[ideology]]" of nominees to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The scores are created by analyzing pre-confirmation newspaper [[editorial]]s regarding the nominations from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Each nominee receives two scores that range from 0 to 1:
* '''Qualifications:''' 0 means unqualified and 1 means extremely qualified
* '''Ideology:''' 0 means [[Conservatism in the United States|most conservative]], and 1 means [[Modern liberalism in the United States|most liberal]].

The Segal–Cover scoring was introduced by Jeffrey Segal and Albert Cover (both of [[Stony Brook University]]) in their 1989 article "Ideological Values and the Votes of U.S. Supreme Court Justices".&lt;ref name="SegalCover1989"&gt;{{cite journal

Segal and Cover found that the scores are strongly correlated with the subsequent votes of the justices. Because the scores are based on perceptions before the nominee takes a seat on the Court, they also provide "reliable measures of the ideological values of Supreme Court justices that are independent of the votes they later cast."&lt;ref name="SegalCover1989" /&gt;

[[File:No Thumbtacks.jpg|thumb|300px]]'''Self-referential humor''', also known as '''self-reflexive humor''' or '''meta humor''', is a type of [[Expression (language)|comedic expression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/phahn/humor/self_ref.htm |title=Sentences about Self-Reference and Recurrence |publisher=.vo.lu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that—either directed toward some other subject, or openly directed toward itself—intentionally [[allude]]s to the very person who is expressing the [[humor]] in a comedic fashion, or to some specific aspect of that same comedic expression.  Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and [[surreal humor|surrealistically]] is a form of [[bathos]]. In general, self-referential humor often uses [[hypocrisy]], [[oxymoron]], or [[paradox]] to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Self referential humor]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Self-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the [[fourth wall]] to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.

[[Old Comedy]] of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. [[Aristophanes]], whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hughes; ''Performing Greek Comedy'' (Cambridge, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[RAS syndrome]] refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an [[acronym]] or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, "RAS" stands for '''R'''edundant '''A'''cronym '''S'''yndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields "Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome" and is self-referencing in a comical manner.  It also reflects an excessive use of [[Three-letter acronym|TLA]]s ('''T'''hree '''L'''etter '''A'''cronyms).

[[Meta]] has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential. Popularised by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] who wrote several books on himself and the subject of self-reference, [[meta-joke]]s are a popular form of humor.

A '''shield law''' is legislation designed to protect [[Reporter's privilege|reporters' privilege]].  This privilege involves the right of news reporters to refuse to testify as to information and/or sources of information obtained during the news gathering and dissemination process. Currently the [[United States|U.S.]] federal government has not enacted any national shield laws, but most of the 50 states do have shield laws or other protections for reporters in place.

==Definition==
A shield law is law that gives reporters protection against being forced to disclose confidential information or sources in state court. There is no federal shield law and state shield laws vary in scope.  In general, however, a shield law aims to provide the classic protection of, "a reporter cannot be forced to reveal his or her source" law. Thus, a shield law provides a privilege to a reporter pursuant to which the reporter cannot be forced by subpoena or other court order to testify about information contained in a news story and/or the source of that information.  Several shield laws additionally provide protection for the reporter even if the source or information is revealed during the dissemination of the news story, that is whether or not the source or information is confidential. Shield laws do not ensure absolute protection.&lt;ref&gt;Graber, Doris A. ''Mass Media and American Politics''. Washington, DC: CQ, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the jurisdiction, the privilege may be total or qualified, and it may also apply to other persons involved in the news-gathering and dissemination process as well, such as an editor or a publisher.

==Origins==
The issue of whether or not journalists can be subpoenaed and forced to reveal confidential information arose in 1972 with the United States Supreme Court case ''[[Branzburg v. Hayes]]''. Paul Branzburg was a reporter for ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and wrote an article about the drug [[hashish]]. In creating the article, he came in contact with two local citizens who had created and used the drug. Because their activity was illegal, Branzburg promised the two individuals that he would not reveal their identities. After the article was published, Branzburg was subpoenaed by a local grand jury and ordered to reveal the identity of his sources. Branzburg refused and cited the provisions for freedom of the press from the First Amendment of the Constitution, in his defense.

The case eventually reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], where the court decided in a five to four decision that the press did not have a Constitutional right of protection from revealing confidential information in court. The court acknowledged, however, that the government must "convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0408_0665_ZD1.html "Branzburg v. Hayes"] on the [[Legal Information Institute]] website of [[Cornell University Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt; While this ruling did not set a precedent for journalistic rights in court, it did define a more stringent set of requirements for when a journalist could be subpoenaed in court.

This ruling was limited in nature, did not set a clear federal precedent regarding journalistic privileges from revealing confidential information, and thus has been interpreted and cited differently by courts over the years. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, for instance, has gleaned a qualified First Amendment privilege from the ''Branzburg'' decision. In ''Riley v. City of Chester'', the Court held that a reporter's right to protect his sources from disclosure could be overcome by a party who, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrated that he has made an effort to obtain the information elsewhere, that the only access to the information sought is through the journalist and his or her source, and that the information sought is crucial to the case. 612 F.2d 708 (3rd Cir. 1979).&lt;ref&gt;http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/545663&lt;/ref&gt;

==State laws==

States differ on their approach to protecting reporter's privilege. {{As of|2011}}, 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]] offer some form of protections&lt;ref&gt;Rozell, Mark J., and Jeremy D. Mayer. 2008. Media Power Media Politics. Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc. pg 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty states (plus D.C.) have passed shield laws.&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=State-by-State Guide to the Reporter's Privilege for Student Media |url=http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/legalresearch.asp?id=60 |work=SPLC.org |publisher=Student Press Law Center |year=2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws vary from state to state. Some protections apply to civil but not to criminal proceedings. Other laws protect journalists from revealing confidential sources, but not other information. Many states have also established court precedents which provide protection to journalists, usually based on constitutional arguments. Only Wyoming lacks both legislation and judicial precedent to protect reporter's privilege.&lt;ref name="SPLC"/&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Proponents of shield laws argue that they ensure that news gatherers may do their jobs to their fullest ability and that they help avoid a dichotomy between state laws and journalistic ethics, but the differences between states' laws has raised questions regarding which laws apply where in regard to national reporting.  Proponents argue that a federal shield law should exist to eliminate contradictions between state laws.

Opponents argue that shield laws afford extra privileges to journalists and that no citizen should be able to ignore a court ordered subpoena. Opponents also cite problems with defining who is considered a journalist or news gatherer and who is not, and note that if journalists get special protection from the government, then they are getting special journalistic benefits from the government instead of acting in complete independence.  Some opponents also argue that journalists are often forced to testify by federal courts only in cases where a federal shield law likely would not protect them anyway.  Finally, the federal government may not have constitutional right to enforce a shield law on state courts.

Many journalists, however, are subpoenaed to testify in criminal and civil cases for coverage of a variety of matters that do not involve questions of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, RonNell Andersen. "Avalanche or Undue Alarm? An Empirical Study of Subpoenas Received by the News Media", 93 MINN. L. REV. 585, 639–40 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, there have been bills for federal shield laws in the United States Congress; however, none of these bills have passed the Senate.  A primary objection to recent efforts to pass a federal shield law has been concern about leaks of classified information, particularly given the modern potential of such leaks to be published globally on the Internet by non-traditional recipients, such as WikiLeaks, who might claim to be "journalists" under an unqualified shield law.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, W. Cory. "Crime That Plays: Shaping a Reporter's Shield to Cover National Security in an Insecure World", 44 WAKE FOREST L. REV. 641 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the press is not even immune from its sources, such as when the source wishes to remain anonymous and the journalist wishes to disclose it. Such was the case in ''[[Cohen v. Cowles Media Co.]]'' (1991). The Supreme Court upheld that a source may have a right to confidentiality if an agreement was made with the reporter.  Unfortunately, the bigger issue of source disclosure gets even more confusing, since the ''Cohen'' and ''Branzburg'' decisions could allow for the possibility of a journalist being subpoenaed by a court to disclose the name of a source, and being sued by a source under promissory estoppel laws for that disclosure.  The current laws of the land, and the gray areas of forecasting potential consequences of publishing a story with confidential sources places the press in a very precarious situation.  The current shield laws in some states give the press somewhat of an upper hand. However, since federal law does not recognize reportorial privilege in most cases, it is understandable how the press might feel muzzled.

The shield law privilege may also be waived by a reporter, as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] recently found in the case of ''In re Michael G. Venezia''.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Michael G. Venezia'', 191 ''N.J.'' 259, 922 ''A.2d'' 1263 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, a New Jersey newspaper published an article containing defamatory statements about the plaintiff.  The article attributed the statements to a source who was identified by name in the article; the source later denied making the defamatory statements.  The plaintiff filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, the reporter and the alleged source of the defamatory statements.  When the plaintiff sought to question the newspaper reporter about the article, the reporter and his newspaper refused, claiming protection under New Jersey's shield law.{{Cite NJSA|title=2A|chapter=84A|section=21|citeonly=true}}  It was discovered, however, that the reporter had already given a statement under oath concerning the article—and, most important, the alleged source of the statement and exactly what that source said—to a local county prosecutor's office.  The reporter also talked about his source and what the source said with a local municipal attorney.  The ''Venezia'' court unanimously held that, while New Jersey has arguably the most protective shield law in the United States, a reporter waives the privilege when he talks about his sources and information outside of the newsgathering process, as did the reporter in ''Venezia.''  The ''Venezia'' court stated: "The privilege holder is not permitted to step from behind the shield as he pleases, sallying forth one moment to make a disclosure to one person and then to seek the shield's protection from having to repeat the same disclosure to another person.  A reporter cannot play peek-a-boo with the privilege."  Thus, the ''Venezia'' court ordered that the reporter must submit to the plaintiff's deposition request.  ''Venezia'' is highly significant because it marks the first time that a reporter has ever been found to have waived the privilege under New Jersey's current shield law, and because it explores the issue of what is or is not a "newsgathering activity," and, thus, what activities are subject to protection under the law.

Currently, courts are struggling to define the standards for when shield laws should apply to non-traditional media outlets, particularly in the context of blogs and Internet publishing. In ''[[Obsidian Finance Group, LLC v. Cox]]'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon]] found that to qualify as a reporter, a standard of professionalism  must be met, including but not limited to being associated with a traditional news print or television media outlet or obtaining a journalism degree. A subsequent opinion in the same case clarified that these were examples and not requirements; bloggers could qualify, and the denial of media status in the Cox case appears to have been largely motivated by the defendant reportedly offering to remove accusations for a substantial fee. Conversely, in ''[[The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.]]'' the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] adopted a much broader definition of media that applies to blogs and website curators, reiterating that "freedom of the press is a fundamental personal right which is not confined to newspapers and periodicals."&lt;ref name="opinion"&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.
|vol=160 |reporter=N.H. |opinion=227 |date=2010 |url=http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2010/2010041mortg.pdf |accessdate=19 Mar. 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[White House]] was pushing for a federal media shield law named the [[Free Flow of Information Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Flow of Information Act of 2009|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.448:|publisher=[[THOMAS|Thomas]]|accessdate=18 July 2013|author=Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by U.S. Senators [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Lindsey Graham]]. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a "clear and convincing" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Criticized on Seizure of Records, White House Pushes News Media Shield Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/us/politics/under-fire-white-house-pushes-to-revive-media-shield-bill.html?_r=0#h|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. "Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom," wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and a board member of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]. "Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama's media shield law makes prosecuting journalists even easier|url=http://rt.com/usa/obama-shield-bill-law-453/|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Russia Today|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a larger effort by journalists to press for federal shield laws formed following the [[Plame affair|Plame affair/CIA leak scandal]], in which reporters who released the name of [[Valerie Plame]] were asked who their sources were. One of the reporters, [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', was jailed for 85 days in 2005 for refusing to disclose her source in the government probe.

There is a question about whether journalists should be exempt from national security laws, or not.&lt;ref&gt;In "Why Journalists Are Not above the Law," Gabriel Schoenfeld talks about the Constitutional freedom of the press. She believes that journalists should not be exempt from national security laws. Schoenfeld feels that journalists should not be able to report on national security issues. Although the shield law is a form of protection, reporters are not covered when it comes to national security.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Michael Rossetti''' (25 September 1829 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1919) was an English writer and critic.

==Biography==
Born in London, he was a son of immigrant Italian scholar [[Gabriele Rossetti]] and his wife [[Frances Polidori|Frances Rossetti ''née'' Polidori]], and the brother of [[Maria Francesca Rossetti]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Christina Rossetti|Christina Georgina Rossetti]].

He was one of the seven founder members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848, and became the movement's unofficial organizer and bibliographer. He edited the Brotherhood's literary magazine ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'' which published four issues in 1850 and wrote the poetry reviews for it.

It was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848:

#To have genuine ideas to express;
#To study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
#To sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote;
#And most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, William Michael. &lt;em&gt;Dante Gabriel Rossetti. His Family-Letters with a Memoir&lt;/em&gt;. (London: Ellis, 1895), p. 135. (http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/pr5246.a43.rad.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Algernon Swinburne]] to [[James McNeill Whistler]]. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle [[John Polidori|John William Polidori]] (author of ''[[The Vampyre]]'' and physician to [[Lord Byron]]), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.

Rossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]], which was published in 1868; however, this edition was [[bowdlerize]]d.&lt;ref name="leavesofgrassessays"&gt;{{Citation

In 1874 he married [[Lucy Madox Brown]], daughter of the painter [[Ford Madox Brown]]. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti|Olivia Frances Madox]], was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne's. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Their son Michael died in infancy. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of [[Ezra Pound]], and the two corresponded frequently.

Gabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904.

William Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic [[art historian]]s, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on [[Fra Angelico]] demonstrating his literary and art-historical style.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "pietistic" quality of Fra Angelico's work is in fact its predominant characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work. Even so, Fra Angelico is a notable artist within his sphere... . &lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, William Michael. "Angelico, Fra". 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">The '''''Ökumenische Heiligenlexikon''''' (ÖHL) or '''''Ecumenical Lexicon of Saints''''' is an independent, [[ecumenical]], private internet project by Protestant priest, Joachim Schäfer, from Stuttgart, which aims to publish information on the lives of [[saint]]s and other "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Schäfer: [http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/ Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon]. Retrieved 21 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexicon ==
The lexicon is the largest and most comprehensive online repository of information on saints and other people considered blessed or holy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bräunlein: [http://www.hsozkult.de/webreview/id/rezwww-55 ''Web-Rezension zu: Das ökumenische Heiligenlexikon.''] In: ''[[H-Soz-u-Kult]]'', 28 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the collection are sources that are generally accessible, especially reprinted church history works. One aim is to edit out conflicting and false information, without making any claim to be scholarly. [[Volunteering|Volunteers]] with relevant expertise help the project with information and check articles for correction.

The ''Ökumenische Heiligenlexikon'' is available on the [[World Wide Web|Internet]], [[CD ROM]]s and other electronic data devices. No book publications are planned.
