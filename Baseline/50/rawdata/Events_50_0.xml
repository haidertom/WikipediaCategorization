The '''999 phone charging myth''' is an [[urban myth]] which claims that if a [[mobile phone]] has low battery then dialing [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (or any regional [[emergency number]]) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls.

== Basis ==
The basis for the myth was a feature of [[BlackBerry]] phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services. People discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up, it would override the shutdown for a number of minutes so that phone calls could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialstudent.co.uk/calling-the-police-doesnt-charge-your-phone-battery/ |title=Calling The Police Doesn't Charge Your Phone Battery |publisher=Social Student |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
The myth is believed to have originated in BlackBerry forums around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/crime/derbyshire-ignore-phone-myth-cops-urge-1-5996352/amp |title=Ignore phone myth, cops urge |work=Derbyshire Times |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.crackberry.com/blackberry-bold-9930-9900-f235/battery-too-low-radio-use-warning-694982/ |title="Battery too low for radio use" warning |publisher=BlackBerry Forums |date= |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Derbyshire Constabulary]] released a press release telling people not to believe the myth that calling 999 charges the battery.&lt;ref name=db /&gt; They cited that for every silent or aborted 999 call received, the operators have to call the person back to make sure there is no emergency.&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-01-13/police-warning-over-mobile-phone-urban-myth/ |title=Police warning over mobile phone urban myth |publisher=ITV |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[hoax calls]] waste police time that could potentially block responses to real emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Cockerton |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dialling-999-not-charge-mobile-2234973 |title=Dialling 999 does NOT charge mobile battery: Derbyshire Police issue warning over urban myth |work=The Mirror |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bedfordshire Police]] also released information asking people not to call 999 except for an emergency as they stated that in the last six months of 2013 they had an increase in hoax 999 calls from people believing the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-01-15/police-dispel-999-myth/ |title=Police dispel 999 myth |publisher=ITV |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources supplemented these press releases by stating that misusing the 999 number is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/13/999-battery-hoax_n_4588617.html |title=Calling 999 Does NOT Boost Your Mobile Phone Battery, Police Warn As Hoax Persists |work=Huffington Post UK |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the police could cut off telephones being used to abuse the 999 service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/news/you-might-be-charged-yourself-if-you-try-to-power-up-your-mobile-1-5873160/amp |title=You might be charged yourself if you try to power up your mobile |work=The Luton News |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related myth emerged: that when [[Siri]] on an [[iPhone]] is told, "Charge my phone to 100%", the phone would call emergency services as a secret safety code. This was later traced to a bug in [[Apple Inc|Apple]] programming that was fixed within a day. The myth continued to spread on social media as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/siri-charge-phone-police/ |title=Telling Siri to 'Charge My Phone to 100%' Summons Police |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">The '''AIDSRides''' were a series of fundraising events organised by Pallotta TeamWorks which raised more than $105 million for critical AIDS services and medical research.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} About half of the money raised directly benefited AIDS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-12-13/news/17632518_1_aids-patients-pat-christen-executive-director-aids-and-hiv | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=AIDS Ride planners sue S.F. charity over new race | date=2001-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] and the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] ended their partnership with the California AIDSRide over concerns that not enough money was going to the charities. They hired Honeycutt Group, a consulting firm started by three former Pallotta TeamWorks employees, to organize [[AIDS/LifeCycle]], a similar event. [[Dan Pallotta]] unsuccessfully sued the "copycat" event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/03/01/319484/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Dan Pallotta's bike-tour and walkathon business has raised more than $200 million for AIDS research &amp; other charities. So why do some people hate him so much?* *Hint: Check out the Lexus in his driveway | date=2002-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the competition and surrounding controversy made 2002 the event's last year.

An '''accident''', also known as an '''unintentional injury''', is an undesirable, incidental, and an unplanned event that could have been prevented had [[Attendant circumstance|circumstances]] leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.&lt;ref name=Robertson2015&gt;{{cite book | last = Robertson | first = Leon S. | title = Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition | year = 2015 | publisher = Lulu Books | url = http://www.nanlee.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical and non-physical===
Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, moving objects, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a [[secret]] or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc.

===By activity===
* Accidents during the execution of work or arising out of it are called [[work accident]]s. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm ILO Safety and Health at Work]". International Labour Organization (ILO)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, [[leisure]]-related accidents are mainly [[Sports injury|sports injuries]].

===By vehicle===

* [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Aviation]]
* [[Bicycle safety|Bicycles]]
* [[Sailing ships]]

* [[Train wrecks]]
* [[Trams]]

==Common causes==
{{See also|Preventable causes of death}}
[[File:Accidents.svg|thumb|300px|Incidence of accidents (of a severity of resulting in seeking medical care), sorted by activity (in Denmark in 2002).]]
Poisons, vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries. According to a 2005 survey of injuries sustained at home, which used data from the National Vital Statistics System of the United States [[National Center for Health Statistics]], falls, poisoning, and fire/burn injuries are the most common causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runyan CW, Casteel C, Perkis D |title=Unintentional injuries in the home in the United States Part I: mortality |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=73–9 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15626560 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.09.010 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]].&lt;ref name=NEISS&gt;CPSC. [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/General-Information/National-Electronic-Injury-Surveillance-System-NEISS/ National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)]. Database query available through: [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/ NEISS Injury Data].&lt;/ref&gt; This program was revised in 2000 to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products.&lt;ref name=NEISS/&gt; Data on [[emergency department]] visits is also collected through the [[National Health Interview Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;NCHS. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/ervisits.htm Emergency Department Visits]. CDC.&lt;/ref&gt; In The U.S. the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has available on their website extensive statistics on workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif|title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident models==

Many models to characterize and analyze accidents have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;A long list of books and papers is given in: {{cite book|title=Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health|date=2004|author=Taylor, G.A.|author2=Easter, K.M.|author3=Hegney, R.P.|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0750661976|pages=241–245, see also pages 140–141 and pages 147–153, also on Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can by classified by type. Notable types and models include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ohsbok.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/32-Models-of-causation-Safety.pdf |title=OHS Body of Knowledge |author1=Yvonne Toft |author2=Geoff Dell |author3=Karen K Klockner |author4=Allison Hutton |chapter=Models of Causation: Safety|editor= HaSPA (Health and Safety Professionals Alliance) |publisher=Safety Institute of Australia Ltd. |date=April 2012 |isbn=978-0-9808743-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May. "Ben Hammott" relating to his alleged discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben Hammott would have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which he believed were [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''Chronology of the Great Famine''' ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') documents a period  of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proximate cause]] was [[famine]] resulting from a potato disease commonly known as [[late blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, ''Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland{{spaced ndash}}where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food{{spaced ndash}}was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.

An important and controversial point of debate, that is notable amongst Irish people, was that Irish food supplies were sufficient until it was taken away by the British the feed the British, and the landlords kept economic benefits to themselves. Some commentators and writers controversially compared this explanation to "genocide".

&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith, ''The Great Hunger'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, pp. xvi–ii, 2–3. {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==

===1845===

====August====
At the beginning of August, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America in 1843-1844 had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it would be a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====September====
Following earlier reports of incidences of the blight in England, on 13 September 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}} pg.32 put the date at the 16th&lt;/ref&gt; potato blight was first reported in Ireland. The crops at Dublin were suddenly perishing, it was reported in the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'', asking "where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot?"  The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

====October====
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|[[Skibbereen]] 1847 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] artist [[James Mahony]] (1810–1879), commissioned by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
*As soon as digging of potato crops began, devastating reports started coming in. Sir Robert Peel found the accounts 'very alarming' and writing to Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary on 13 October reminded him that there was always a tendency in Irish news to exaggerate.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.41&lt;/ref&gt; Constabulary Reports from the 15 reported great failures, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary wrote that the truth about the potato crop, until digging was completed, could not be fully ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] was prompted to act,&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Irish History'' (1994) edited by T.W.Moody and F.X.Martin. Page 268. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|1-85635-108-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October he decided to summon an emergency meeting of his Cabinet for 31 October. The remedy he decided was to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="cws-p50"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; Peel then decided to set up a Scientific Commission to go to Ireland and investigate the potato blight and report on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergency Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The first day consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission be established in Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of [[Corn Laws]]. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of "actual or apprehended scarcity" and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was not.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;

The principle of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

According to Cecil Woodham-Smith, the rising wrath of Tories and landlords ensured "all interest in Ireland was submerged."  She writes that the Tory Mayor of Liverpool refused to call a meeting for the relief of Irish distress. She continues that the [[Mansion House Committee]] in Dublin was accused of 'deluding the public with a false alarm', and the blight itself 'was represented as the invention of agitators on the other side of the water'. The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the domestic issue of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, "slipped into the background."&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

====November====

*On 9–10 November&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 54&lt;/ref&gt; Peel ordered the secret purchase of £100,000 worth of [[Maize|Indian corn]] and meal from America for distribution in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November the Scientific Commissioners reported that half the potato crop had been destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;
*On 19 November the Mansion House Committee in Dublin claimed to have "ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that considerably more than one-third of the entire potato crop...has been already destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.43&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 November the Relief Commission first met.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52, Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unable to persuade his Cabinet to repeal the Corn Laws, on 5 December Peel tendered his resignation &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; to Queen Victoria but was reinstated days later when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] was unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846===
The first deaths from hunger took place in early 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keneally (1999) ''The Great Shame''. London: Vintage: 110&lt;/ref&gt; In March Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 78–86&lt;/ref&gt; The new Whig administration under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], influenced by their [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 408–11&lt;/ref&gt; then halted government food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.&lt;ref name="david2002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 224, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Grain continued to be exported from the country.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847===
[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Leave Ireland'', engraving by Henry Doyle (1827–1892), from Mary Frances Cusack's Illustrated History of Ireland, 1868]]
There were average crop yields in the 1847 harvest, but due to lack of seed potatoes to plant, the crop was low.&lt;ref&gt;Líam Kennedy, Paul S. Ell, E. M. Crawford &amp; L. A. Clarkson, Mapping The Great Irish Famine, Four Courts Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85182-353-0}} pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds began to throng the public works during the last months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which promoted exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.'&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.173&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 136&lt;/ref&gt; This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg. 81–85&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 174–187&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the '[[coffin ships]]' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.179&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1847 The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847]] was enacted due to growing Irish nationalist agitation that was causing the British government concern about a possible [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|violent rebellion]] against British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, Cecil [[The Great Hunger]] Ireland1845 1849 Harper and Row   New york pages 326-327&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill gave the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the power to organise the island into districts and bring police forces into them at the districts' expense. It limited who could own guns, and required all of the men in the district between the ages of 16 and 60 to assist in apprehending suspected murderers when landlords were killed, or else be guilty of a misdemeanour themselves.

===1848===
The blight returned in 1848 and outbreaks of cholera were reported.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Evictions became common among the Irish who could not keep up with the demands of their British landlords. Famine victims on outdoor relief peaked in July at almost 840,000 people.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; On 29 July [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|an uprising against the government]] was led by [[William Smith O'Brien]]. After a skirmish at "[[Famine Warhouse 1848|Widow McCormack's house]]" in the village of [[Ballingarry, South Tipperary|Ballingarry]], [[County Tipperary]] the leaders of the rebellion fled to America or were sentenced to transportation.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kee (2000) ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'': 270-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1849===
The potato crop failed again in 1849 and famine was accompanied by cholera outbreaks.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; This deadly cholera epidemic killed one of Ireland's greatest poets: [[James Clarence Mangan]].&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;

===1850===
The Famine ended.&lt;ref name="david20022002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===1851===
By 1851 census figures showed that the population of Ireland had fallen to 6,575,000 – a drop of 1,600,000 in ten years.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend that the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete and biased count" of fatalities during the famine.&lt;ref name="cormac2006"&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland’s Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, University College Dublin Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 226&lt;/ref&gt; The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation of so many people.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}
'''Closure''' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a [[business]] or other organization to continue to operate.  Closure may be the result of a [[bankruptcy]], where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the [[proprietor]] of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a [[corporate merger]].  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.

While a closure is typically of a business or a [[non-profit organization]], any [[entity]] which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.

Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones{{fact|date=December 2013}}, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.

The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.

If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law{{clarifyme|date=December 2013}} any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.

If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy [[liquidation]]: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.

Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the [[Soviet Union]] into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of [[East Germany]] can be considered a [[merger]] rather than a closure as [[West Germany]] assumed all of the assets and liabilities of [[East Germany]]. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while [[Russia]] assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid [[parking ticket]]s accumulated by [[motor vehicle]]s operated on behalf of [[diplomatic mission]]s operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.

Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] railroad, the [[Enron scandal]]s, and [[MCI Worldcom]]'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into [[Verizon]].

A '''common year''' is a [[calendar year]] with 365 [[day]]s.  More generally, a common year is one without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]].  The [[Gregorian calendar]], (like the earlier [[Julian calendar]]), employs both common years and leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the [[tropical year]], which does not contain an exact number of days.

The common year of 365 days has 52 [[week]]s and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 fell on a Sunday in 2017) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has four weeks, so March will begin on the same day of the week. November will also begin on this day.

In the Gregorian calendar, 303 of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the [[Julian calendar]], 300 out of every 400 years are common years, and in the [[Revised Julian calendar]] (used by Greece) 682 out of every 900 years are common years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L. (editor) "Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go", ''What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question'', London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros.

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

'''EgyptAir Flight 648''' was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens [[Ellinikon International Airport]] in Greece and [[Cairo International Airport]] in Egypt. On 23 November 1985, a [[Boeing 737-200]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 11241985 |publisher=Airdisaster.com |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085212/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; airliner, registered SU-AYH, servicing the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by the terrorist organization [[Abu Nidal]]. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by [[Egypt]]ian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. 

==Hijacking==
On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its [[Athens]]-to-[[Cairo]] route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The [[Palestinian political violence|terrorists]], calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and [[grenade]]s.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terrorist leader, [[Omar Rezaq]], proceeded to check all [[passport]]s. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdominion.com/2012/03/03/interpol-investigates-terror-in-the-skies.html Interpol Investigates – Terror in the Skies&lt;/ref&gt; aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the [[fuselage]] was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.

[[Libya]] was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, [[Malta]] was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an [[Alitalia]] aircraft was hijacked on its way to [[Italy]]. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the [[Aviator|pilot]], Hani Galal, to land at [[Luqa Airport]]. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

==Standoff==
At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the [[Arab world]], and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]], rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20101123/local/anniversary-of-a-massacre-the-egyptair-hijacking-in-malta.337385|title=Anniversary of a massacre – The EgyptAir hijack in Malta|date=23 November 2010|work=[[Times of Malta]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430015446/http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2011|title=10 Most Terrifying Airplane Hijackings of All Time|date=|work=[[Criminal Justice Degrees Guide]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds.  Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans – Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5" tall.

France, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at [[Naples]]. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian [[Unit 777]] under the command of Major-General [[Kamal Attia]] was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread [[suffocation]]. On the other hand, the ''[[Times of Malta]]'', quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737–266 SU-AYH Malta-Luqa Airport (MLA) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

A total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.

Rezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic [[double jeopardy]]). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in [[Nigeria]]. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book ''[[Massacre in Malta]]'', [[John A. Mizzi]] writes:

{{cquote|Malta was faced with a problem it was ill-equipped to meet. The authorities took a firm stand in denying fuel to the hijackers but made no sensible provisions, through political bias and lack of experience, to meet the circumstances that arose from this decision. No proper team was set up at the outset to evaluate or deal progressively with the crisis, although only a few days previously an incident management course had been organized by a team of U.S. experts in Malta at the request of the government.&lt;ref name="Mizzi"&gt;Mizzi, J.A. (1989). ''Massacre in Malta : The Hijack of Egyptair MS 648'', 72 p:ill. J.A. Mizzi – Valletta : Technografica, 1989. DDC : 364.162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mizzi adds:

{{cquote|The Egyptian commandos were given too free a hand and they acted out of their mission with little regard for the safety of the passengers. They were determined to get the hijackers at all costs and the Maltese government's initial refusal for U.S. anti-terrorist resources (a team led by a major-general with listening devices and other equipment) offered by the [[State Department]] through the U.S. Embassy in Malta – a decision reversed too late – contributed in no small measure to the mismanagement of the entire operation.&lt;ref name="Mizzi" /&gt;}}

Mizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold – the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the [[censorship]] of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through [[RAI TV]], when its correspondent [[Enrico Mentana]] spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: "Parlo da Malta. Qui c'è stato un massacro ..." ("I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in [[Floriana]]. The United States had seen the situation as so ‘hot’ that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by [[Boeing 737-800]]. The [[flight number]] 648 
is now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the [[Biography Channel]] television program ''[[I Survived...]]'', which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a sub-speciality in the Maltese islands, performed Ms Pflug's neurosurgical procedure. Ms Pflug also related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, ''Miles to Go Before I Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jackie Nink Pflug|author2=Peter Kizilos|title=Miles to Go Before I Sleep: A Survivor's Story of Life After a Terrorist Hijacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royVNfdQE6cC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2001|publisher=Hazelden Publishing|isbn=978-1-56838-837-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an ''[[Interpol Investigates]]'' episode, [[Interpol Investigates#Terror in the Skies|"Terror in the Skies"]], broadcast by the [[National Geographic Channel]].

The hijacking is also the subject of the book ''Valinda, Our Daughter'', written by Canadian author [[Gladys Taylor (publisher)|Gladys Taylor]].

The events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot in [[Brad Thor]]'s novel Path of the Assassin.

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor [[Yusuf Sibai]] and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Enigmarelle''''' was a fake humanoid [[automaton]], in fact with a person concealed inside, which was exhibited as a scientific and technical curiosity around 1905 in the US and Europe, chiefly in theaters. Enigmarelle was claimed to be able to perform several extraordinary tasks, which it demonstrated in performances: these included walking, riding a bicycle, and writing its name on a blackboard.

== Presentation==
Enigmarelle was shown in the US and then in parts of Europe, in [[vaudeville]] theaters and circuses. The booking agent, an American named Frederick J. Ireland, was represented at these appearances as the creator and owner of the automaton.

Enigmarelle was a large automaton and was in fact operated by a human concealed within its body, although the precise operating mechanisms are not known. The operator is believed to have been a performer who had had both his legs [[amputation|amputated]] and who went by the name of Alba W. Root, and who also performed as a bicycle acrobat using leg [[prosthesis|prostheses]]. &lt;!-- is believed to be Alba W. Root, who lost both legs in a train accident as a boy. Enigmarelle was designed to exploit this disability, with removable legs to "prove" its mechanical nature. --&gt;

Enigmarelle was the subject of a short documentary film in 1905&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Goble |title=Enigmarelle the Wonderful Automaton - Film / Movie |url=http://www.citwf.com/film423590.htm |website=Complete Index To World Film |access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a detailed "scientific" description with three photos in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1906.&lt;ref group="C"&gt;{{cite news |language=en|title=A Clever Mechanical and Electrical Automaton |periodical=Scientific American |volume=94 |issue=2 |date=1906-01-13 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-clever-mechanical-and-electrical/|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in some modern publications on automatons.&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite book|language=en|author1=Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume|title=Clockwork Music|location=Australia|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1973|pages=334|isbn=9780047890048|quotation=Another and equally spectacular 'android' was that exhibited at the London Hippodrome in 1905. Called Enigmarelle, this seven-foot high figure possessed incredible abilities. It would walk on to the stage, write its name in somewhat backward-sloping manuscript upon a blackboard, and then ride a bicycle in a circle. Its head was of wax, its feet of steel and its legs of wood and iron. The motive power comprised no less than seven motors-three being spring, and four electric which drew their power from wet-cell batteries concealed in the trunk. Unbuttoning its waistcoat revealed a mass of wheelwork and wires, levers, and cranks. Unfortunately, within all this trumpery there beat no mechanical heart, but that of a real, live man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The name ''Enigmarelle'' seems to be a [[portmanteau]] of the French words ''énigme'' (enigma) and ''marelle'' ([[hopscotch]]), but the creators of the machine were English speakers, so there is no reason to suppose a French portmanteau is the true origin of the name.

==History==

Event chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the [[Risk register]]. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes.

==Principles==

===Moment of risk and state of activity===

[[File:EventChainDiagramForOneActivity.png|thumb|355px|Event chain diagram for one activity]]Activities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using [[statistical distribution]]. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources.

===Event chains===

Events can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. 
For example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events.

Events can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event “structural defect is discovered” can cause one or many activities “Repair”. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a "sender", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called "receiver" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events.

===Event chain diagrams===
[[File:EventChainDiagramExample1.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram: local and global threats and opportunities with different probabilities and impacts]]
[[Event chain diagram]] is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.&lt;ref&gt;Virine, Lev &amp; McVean, Jason. (2004). Visual Modeling of Business Problems: Workflow and Patterns, In Proceedings of 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Virine, Lev &amp; Rapley, Lisa. (2003). Visualization of Probabilistic Business Models, In Proceedings of 2003 Winter Simulation Conference, New Orleans, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules:

*Event chains diagrams present events as arrows on the Gantt charts.  
*Arrows pointing down are threats. Arrows pointing up are opportunities. 
*Issues are shown as an arrow within a circle. Color of the issue arrow is red (dark).
*Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. 
*Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. 
*Colors represent the calculated impact of the risk. Higher impacts are red or darker shade. Low impacts are green or lighter shade. The size of the arrow represents probability.
*Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events.
*Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow.
*Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame.
By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

[[File:EventChainDiagramExample.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram with critical event chain and activity triggered by event]]
Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event.

===Monte Carlo simulation===
Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Goran Avlijas. (2018). Examining the Value of Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Time Management. Management:Journal of Sustainable Business and Management Solutions in Emerging Economies. 10.7595/management.fon.2018.0004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashyap, Heena. (2016). Risk Analysis and Estimation of Schedule Using Monte Carlo Simulation. International Journal Of Engineering And Computer Science. 10.18535/ijecs/v5i9.42&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, T. "Why Monte Carlo simulations of project networks can mislead". Project Management Journal, Vol 35. Issue 3, (2004): 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.

In Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words one event can belong to different categories.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Ruchi. and Virine, Lev. (2017). Monte Carlo Project Risk Analysis. In Raydugin, Y. (ed) Handbook of Research on Leveraging Risk and Uncertainties for Effective Project Management. IGI Global; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category.

===Critical event chains===
Monte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These  are called “critical events” or “critical chains of events”. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non-schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category.

===Project control with event and event chains===
Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for  performance tracking is forecasting an activity’s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project

==Phenomena==

===Repeated activities===
[[File:RepeatedActivity.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Repeated Activity]]Sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined.

===Event chains and risk response===
[[File:MitigationPlan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mitigation plan]]If an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. 
Risk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events.

===Resource allocation based on events===
One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation 
of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.

A '''false ending''' has two contexts: in literature, film and video games it is a narrative device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still more to the story; in a musical composition, however, it is a complete stop of the work or song for one or more seconds before continuing.

The presence of a false ending can be anticipated through a number of ways: the medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to pull this off effectively; another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.

==Film==

In ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' , it seems like the criminal case that the movie revolves around is completely closed with no loose ends until one of the witnesses admits that she lied about important details to give more importance towards the trial of the people who raped her, exposing a cover-up conspiracy. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the director keeps using editing techniques that are indicative of endings in scenes that could be used as such, but continues until the movie finally ends. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' has two false endings. Another example is in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where, at a very climatic stage in the film, the screen fades away and says ''[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]'', which is then followed by the word "Immediately."

Some movies come to a formal ending, followed by the rolling of the credits, which is almost universally used to indicate that the film has ended, only to have the actors reappear in one or more [[mid-credits scene]]s. In comedy films, these sequences may be [[blooper]]s or [[outtake]]s. In other types of films, the mid-credit scenes may continue the narrative set out in the movie. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] movies have become notorious for this, in some cases featuring a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene in the same movie.

In the police comedy ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), two police officers realize that a cult is controlling their town. After the two officers defeat the head of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance and his members, who have been causing problems in the town, the pair are celebrating their success at the police station, and the movie appears to be wrapping up. Then a surviving member of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance enters the station and shoots an old musket, which triggers an old-fashioned mine.

==Television==

==Video games==
Some examples in video games include ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Wild ARMs]]''. Both involve confrontations with the major antagonists at what seems like their final lairs, but instead a crisis occurs and the story continues. A third is in ''[[Naval Ops: Warship Gunner]]'', upon sinking the ''Druna Skass'' a second time (Which can only happen if the player plays though the game again, as the game resets itself to the beginning if you sink it once), the player is greeted by another supership, that looks just like the ''Druna Skass''. Yet another example is the [[survival horror]] game ''[[Obscure II]]'', in which the player must wait until the credits roll to their conclusion before gameplay resumes.

[[Role-playing video game]]s are notorious for having such plot devices. It usually involves the game's main antagonist being defeated, only for a previously mentioned character to be revealed as the "real" villain. One example is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', in which the main character is apparently about to have a boss fight with the former villain Zant, but Zant reveals he has been working for another Villain.
Another example is "[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]" where after you defeat Medusa, credits roll but are quickly interrupted by Hades, the villain for the rest of the game.

In video games, it is difficult to use the false ending device effectively. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled designer, there are several methods that allow it to be done. In several video games, such as those with multiple playable characters and story lines, the game may appear to end after defeating a difficult boss, or clearing what appears to be the "Final" level, complete with credits, an [[Closing credits|outro]], and a return to the start screen. These endings are different from bad endings, as everything may appear to be resolved. However, fulfilling conditions such as clearing all the storylines, reloading the save file, or reaching the "ending" in a [[New Game+]] mode may give the player the option to continue on to the real ending.

An example of this is ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', and its sequel ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. In the former, while there are six stories to play, only the main character's, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character) | Sonic's]] is the most complete. The other characters' stories are simply side-stories. However, if "all" of the stories are completed, a final story appears that wraps up the game and acts as the "true" ending. In the latter, there are two stories to play, one for the heroes, and one for the villains. Of note is the plot device is hidden in a false [[Chaos Emerald]] being used that would destroy the space colony in which the villain [[Doctor Eggman]] is using as a base. It is at first implied that Eggman took the false Emerald, but in reality, when the last story is played, again, after the two normal stories are completed, a true conclusion is offered.

Another example could be the survival horror game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', where, depending on your choice, you get to play with one of the two characters and get a certain ending for one of them to later discover, when you finish playing the second path with the second character, you fight the real final boss and the "true" ending (That may vary depending of which character you have chosen first) is shown. The main difference between both of the "true" endings are that places and times are exchanged, as well as the final dialogue from the game.

''The Consequence'', the second Kidman DLC for 2014's ''[[The Evil Within]]'', features a secret false ending in a similar manner to those shown in the ''Resident Evil'' franchise. At one point, Juli Kidman encounters the brain of the game's main antagonist, Ruben Victoriano, sealed [[Brain in a jar|inside a glass container]] hooked up to the STEM system in Beacon Hospital. Should the player choose to shoot the container and break it, the game cuts to black, then begins the credits sequence, cutting short on a postcard depicting Juli, Joseph and Sebastian on a postcard, before promptly returning to the game as Kidman exclaims "What the fuck?!", indicating the whole sequence was a hallucination.

==Music==
False endings are a known device in classical music. [[Josef Haydn]] was fond of them, for example inducing applause at the wrong place in the finales of his [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Fourth_movement|String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2]] (nicknamed "The Joke")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/may/29/haydn-playful-composer-tom-service |title=Haydn composed existential comedy |first=Tom |last=Service |authorlink=Tom Service |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Symphony No. 90 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sarahhicksconductor.com/web/buzz_details.aspx?ItemId=554184 |title= Haydn’s Head Fake |date=16 May 2010 |first=Sarah |last=Hicks |authorlink=Sarah Hicks |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Prokoviev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] contains false endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/composition/4176 |title=Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, "Classical" |first=Richard |last=Rodda |website=[[Kennedy Center]] |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
In music, a number of [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[song]]s use false endings in which the music is arranged so that the song appears to be coming to its ending (e.g., reaching a final [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] on the [[tonic (music)|chord of the home key]] and then stopping), but then the music recommences. Examples include [[The Rascals]]' "[[Good Lovin']]"; [[The Four Tops]]' "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]", "[[White Room]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]; "[[The Peace!]]" by [[Morning Musume]]; "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]; "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]" by [[The Beatles]]; "[[Monday, Monday]]" by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and "[[But You Know I Love You]]" by [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]. Another notable example of a musical false ending is "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" by [[Bryan Adams]] - because the original song was six and a half minutes long, the false ending became the end of the single/video edit of the song (the album version had a fadeout ending).

In addition, several other songs have also had false endings, such as "[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]" by [[Amy Grant]], a #1 Christian hit in 1984. Another example is "[[Keep on Dancing (The Gentrys song)|Keep On Dancing]]", a 1965 Top 10 hit for the group [[The Gentrys]] from Memphis, Tennessee. In both songs, there is a pause of two seconds before the music starts all over again. Also, "[[When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)]]" by [[The Beach Boys]], has a sudden stop and resumes 1 second later as the band counts numbers of years of age until the song fades, counting from 19 to 30. The [[Alice in Chains]] track "Rain When I Die" has a fade-out false ending lasting about 20 seconds, then the music comes back, and then it fades once more, thus providing the real ending. "[[Weather with You]]" by [[Crowded House]] appears to be ending and then another small instrumental is followed by a final chorus.

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]. [[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
30 participants, half men and half women, were expected to compete on a remote Siberian island in the [[Ob River]] for a 100 million rouble ($1.7 million) prize on a nine month survival mission.
All contestants were said to have signed death waivers and agreed not to hold the organisers accountable for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siberian-real-life-hunger-games-will-not-stop-rape-murder-fight-1-7m-prize-1611060|title=Siberian real-life Hunger Games will 'not stop' rape or murder in fight for $1.7m prize|last=Taylor|first=Alex|date=2017-03-11|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. We will have nothing to do with this. This will be spelled out in a document to be signed by the participant before the start of the show.
We will not intervene into relations between participants nor monitor their sexual life either, and our cameras will not be able to follow every move in every corner of the island.|author=[[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]], executive producer}}

However, [[Snopes]] found that 'Despite multiple misleading headlines, the waiver described by news outlets explicitly stated that contestants on the show would be obliged to "obey the laws of the Russian Federation".'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russian-reality-show-game2-winter-allows-rape-murder/|title=Russian Reality Show ‘Game2: Winter’ Allows Rape, Murder?

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

Eleven distinct [[flood basalt]] episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in [[large volcanic province]]s, creating [[plateau]]s and [[mountain range]]s on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4866/663 http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|authors=[[Michael R.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

== History ==

GigMasters was founded in 1997 by New York area entrepreneurs Michael Caldwell and Kevin Kinyon. In February of that year, the company launched the first version of its website. In September 2010, GigMasters raised $200,000 in expansion funding from investor James Marciano.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2013, about half of the company's booking were wedding-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/fading-glory-demand-elvis-impersonators-isnt-what-it-used-be "Fading glory: Demand for Elvis impersonators isn't what it used to be"]. ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'',  September 7, 2013.  by LAURA CARROLL&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the company raised $1.3 million in series A funding by [[XO Group]], parent company of TheKnot.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digiday.com/media/bridal-publishers-tie-knot-content-commerce/ "Bridal publishers tie the knot between content and commerce"]. ''[[Digiday]]'', October 27, 2015 by Ricardo Bilton&lt;/ref&gt; Kristin Savilia, XO Group's Executive Vice President, joined GigMasters' board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketbrief.com/gigmasters-com-inc-form-d-sec-filng-2014-2-24 GigMasters Inc.

In September 2014, Inc. Magazine ranked GigMasters as one of the nation's 5000 fastest growing private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2014/state/ct Top Companies in Connecticut on the 2014 Inc. 5000] ''INC'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2015, the Caldwell and Kinyon, creators of GigMasters, sold the company for $8.5 million to [[XO Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/The-Knot-owner-buys-Norwalk-s-GigMasters-6550809.php "The Knot owner buys Norwalk‘s GigMasters"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries. It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kariel|first1=Herbert G.|last2=Rosenvall|first2=Lynn A.|title=Factors influencing international news flow|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1984|volume=61|issue=3|page=509-516|doi=10.1177/107769908406100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., &amp; Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segev|first1=Elad|last2=Blondheim|first2=Menahem|title=America's global standing according to popular news sites from around the world|journal=Political Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=1|page=139-161|doi=10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the presence of international news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each).&lt;ref name="segev" /&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical studies&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=Visible and invisible countries: News flow theory revised|journal=Journalism|date=2015|volume=16|issue=3|page=412-428|doi=10.1177/1464884914521579|url=http://jou.sagepub.com/content/16/3/412|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among online news websites and [[news aggregators]] the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

'''Human response to [[disaster]]s''' has been recorded throughout human history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  In ancient times disasters were often perceived as a result of a deity, divine being, or spiritual creature showing their displeasure over human behavior.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This later changed as humans began to see disasters as natural events that caused physical destruction and social chaos to individuals, communities, and societies as opposed to responses to human actions.

The term "disaster myth" has been created to describe the belief that people will behave in an irrational, uncontrolled, and even extreme manner outside of normal and accepted social standards despite evidence that proponents state prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;John Drury, David Novelli, and Clifford Stott, “Psychological disaster myths in the perception and management of mass emergencies: Psychological disaster myths,” ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', 43 (2013): 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Aptekar, ''Environmental Disasters in Global Perspective'' (New York: G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1994), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the term further state that people will only act irrationally in the direst of circumstances when terrible danger is imminent and no avenue of escape appears available. They argue that these disaster myths cause a negative impact when they cause people, officials, and disaster-relief organizations to make detrimental or incorrect [[disaster response|disaster planning and response]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panic/Scared ==
One commonly held disaster myth is that people develop an insurmountable, illogical fear in the face of a [[disaster]].  In turn, this fear becomes infectious, spreads to others, and causes people to flee without thinking and in a chaotic manner that could hurt those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, just the opposite can be expected in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when experiencing the increased stress from an [[earthquake]], since they arrive unannounced and it is not known when the aftershocks will end, people continue to act rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only do few people panic, most are unwilling to participate in an organized evacuation.  Those who live in the disaster area tend to stay in place.  The only ones who usually flee are the visitors, tourists, and transients.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Disaster]]s also draw people to the area.  Some want to help while others just want to see the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public and organizations involved in [[emergency management|emergency planning, management, and response]] all tend to accept this disaster myth as reality.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S191-S192.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Panic]]king can cause harm to others if people flee without thought.  Staying put can be even worse since the people are not getting away from the [[disaster|disaster’s]] damage and destruction.  When necessary, people should evacuate in an orderly manner to avoid the [[disaster]].  It also provides an opportunity to help others evacuate who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] can cause officials to be cautious when issuing public bulletins.  By not wanting to instigate or amplify the believed [[panic]], officials may wait too long to provide the information on which the populace should act.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid contributing to or increasing the level of this mythical [[panic]], officials have also chosen to not share information about preparations for some types of [[disaster]]s (e.g. [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare|biological]] attacks).&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of the panic myth was seen with Orson Welles’ [[The War of the Worlds]] radio broadcast in 1938, the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire]], and as [[Hurricane Carla]] approached the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rational behavior also dominated after [[earthquake]]s in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite many reports of widespread [[panic]], evidence later proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] affecting the official warnings of authorities has been seen in Mexico when the Rio Grande River flooded, in Italy during the [[flood]]ing of the city of Florence, and after a volcanic eruption in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the instances when authorities chose to send the military instead of humanitarian organizations in response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], it was in some part to help manage and control the perceived [[panic]] among the population.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shock ==
Many people believe those who experience a [[disaster]] firsthand experience emotional trauma that has both immediate and lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought the initial devastation of the [[disaster]] leaves people too fragile and in [[Acute stress reaction|shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they are unable to cope with their situation or participate in recovery efforts.  They are consequently dependent on assistance from outside relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a small minority of cases does this myth turn out to be true.  And many times, the experienced shock is short-lived.  What in fact happens in most cases is people react immediately to the [[disaster]] and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[disaster]] can also be a jolt of energy which drives people to respond to the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Claude de Ville de Goyet, “Stop Propagating Disaster Myths,” ''The Lancet'', 356, no. 9231 (August 26, 2000): 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who went through the [[disaster]] are the first engaged in relief and rescue efforts before any outside agency.  They come together along familiar lines such as family and friends and then move as needed to a larger scale involving groups with which they associate (e.g. churches).  If the familiar cannot be contacted or they are unable to respond, only then do most people look toward the faceless law enforcement, welfare, and relief organizations for assistance.  People will also seek help from outside the familiar when special equipment or medical skills are required.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of widespread shock leads outside relief organizations to plan their efforts as if they are the only ones who will be providing assistance.  This may create a disconnected rather than complementary relationship between them and the local agencies.  Additionally, the feeling on the part of the survivors that they do not need to rely on outsiders coupled with the relief organizations believing they are saviors creates a wall between the two which in turn inhibits communication, coordination, and effective relief and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

People’s reliance on self and the well-known was seen in a variety of disaster types such as the [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado|1953 tornado in Flint-Beecher, Michigan]], the 1955 flood of Marysville and Yuba City, California, [[Hurricane Audrey]] in 1957, [[Hurricane Carla]] in 1961, [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both in [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|Mexico City in 1985]] and in [[1999 Izmit earthquake|Turkey in 1999]], thousands of local residents banded together to search for fellow victims in the earthquake wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neighbors performed more than half of the rescue activities after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] hit Kobe City, Japan in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistance ==
People believe the population impacted by a [[disaster]] are unable to do anything about their situation so are standing by just waiting for the saviors from afar to swoop in with the solution to all of their suffering.  Not only that, relief organizations often think the aid must be provided immediately.  This myth is especially pervasive when the [[disaster]] strikes a third-world country and it is a “superior” western country coming to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762-763.&lt;/ref&gt;

While relief organizations with emergency managers, medical teams, and the like do offer assistance after a [[disaster]], most people are actually saved by other survivors and local authorities, agencies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this myth, more supplies are often sent than the disaster area typically needs.  In addition to excess quantity, much of the supplies end up being of little to no use.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relief organizations often do not wait for an assessment of the disaster area and an identification of needs which can be provided by local officials or performed by themselves.  As a consequence, money is often wasted on sending unneeded teams of experts or supplies when local authorities and victims would benefit more if that same money was allocated towards providing resources that filled gaps and complemented their efforts.  Donors compound the issue by donating used clothing, household items, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  With too many supplies on-hand or in possession of supplies they cannot use, local officials are forced to waste manpower and resources on disposing of them.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of providing unwanted and unrequested goods, organizations and donors should send money which can be more easily applied to fulfilling local needs.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this myth’s impact was seen following the [[1993 Hokkaidō earthquake]] as authorities were forced to spend 1.2 million in U.S. dollars on the removal of unnecessary relief supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
Outside rescue, relief, and recovery agencies almost always miscalculate the amount of available resources for basic needs that are available locally in the aftermath of a [[disaster]].  They believe there are not enough materiel, supplies, and personnel for the initial response.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are usually enough supplies to last several weeks.  Enough food can normally be found in stores, warehouses, and people’s homes.  Clothing is rarely needed.  Medical supplies reside in hospitals, warehouses, or nearby communities.  Hospitals as well as police and fire departments often transition to 24-hour operations.  And no evidence is available that proves the unfound belief that key personnel will leave their posts to go attend to their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief agencies tend to believe they must act immediately rather than assess the situation first.  As a result, they often provide supplies when there is already enough on-site for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
The prevalence of [[looting]] in the wake of [[disaster]]s is another common myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that [[disaster]]s provide cover for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, people take advantage of law enforcement and other agencies responsible for maintaining the peace, safety, and security being occupied with disaster response and relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  People believe criminals will use the [[disaster]] as an opportunity to loot due to a prevalence of evacuated, abandoned, and unguarded homes and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[looting]] can occur, they are always isolated incidents.  And much reported [[looting]] is either entirely false or, at worst, desperate survivors scavenging for necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

But because people believe [[looting]] happens, they frequently refuse to leave despite the disaster’s destruction and damage in order to protect their homes and property.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  When no [[looting]] occurs, people tend to believe it is because enough security was in place to prevent it rather than looters did not exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, officials who believe in this myth end up assigning personnel to a protection role rather than to a much more critical rescue, relief, or logistics support function.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of connection between [[disaster]]s and [[looting]] was seen in the rates for theft and burglaries actually falling after [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth’s impact was also seen outside the United States as evidenced by many Guatemalans staying after the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake]] out of fear of having their animals, homes, and possessions stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morale ==
People tend to believe that survivors are extremely negative after a disaster and need to assurance that the outside world cares and the future is bright for themselves and their community.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, people are most often optimistic and have very high [[morale]] in a disaster’s aftermath.  They frequently subordinate any personal feelings of loss and suffering in order to apply themselves to providing food, shelter, and other services to those in need.  Their motivation to help one another boosts the sense of community and togetherness.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the myth, dignitaries and officials feel the need to come to the disaster area to reassure the survivors.  They often make promises of aid that either are not kept or do not happen in a timely manner.  This can cause survivors to resent outsiders.  This resentment in turn can prevent the survivors from asking for needed skills and resources that the outsiders can in fact provide.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
When a [[disaster]] results in deaths, especially in large quantities, people often believe they are at considerable risk of catching a [[disease]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also believe [[epidemic|disease epidemics]] develop in the wake of [[disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they died from the [[disaster]] does not make them a risk for spreading [[disease]]s.  If a body does carry a [[infection|communicable disease]], the person already had it when he or she was alive.  The fact that the body is now stationary and will remain in one place makes it less of a risk than prior to death.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  And an [[epidemic]] would happen only if either of two circumstances exist:  1) the [[disaster]] brings [[disease]] with it for which the people are not immune or 2) the disaster’s effects lead to [[malnutrition]], the [[malnutrition]] increases susceptibility to [[disease]], and finally, a large number of people contract the [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in the myth can result in the hurried disposal of the bodies without proper identification, burial, or involvement by the next of kin.  This can add to the suffering of survivors because they were not allowed to properly care for their loved ones.  In addition to the personal toll, needlessly disposing of dead bodies can divert personnel and supplies from other areas where at that time they are needed more (e.g. involved in actions that benefit those still living).&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear or rumor of an [[epidemic]] can also cause relief organizations to provide medicines, resources, and other aid for a problem that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth has been repeated many times such as in the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua]], [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, the [[1999 Izmit earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]], and the [[2000 Mozambique flood|2000 flooding in Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, rumors of [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhus]] that were later proven to be false followed the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake in Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuation of myths ==
[[File:Hydra1.gif|thumb|Myths Live On]]

=== By people ===
People who have experienced a [[disaster]] often believe the dramatic accounts of their own suffering.  It allows them to pass off their actions as atypical and heroic.  In the process of telling others about their involvement, the mythic component of their story is spread along with the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster survivors tend to worry about [[looting]].  Their increased anxiety can cause them to spread reports whether they definitely know of any or not.  While most people who are asked admit to not having personally witnessed or experienced [[looting]], many claim of being aware of it elsewhere.  The belief in [[looting]] can make people jump to the conclusion that looting was the cause of items going missing before considering the [[disaster]] may have moved, buried, or destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By organizations ===
Government agencies, civilian organizations, and [[first responder]]s all believe to some extent in disaster myths.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this happens, the myths in turn are often included in their [[disaster response|planning and response]] to [[disaster]]s, victims, and survivors.  And practices based even partially on disaster myths are not only likely to result in inappropriate or inefficient relief and response actions, they can also help to perpetuate the myths thereby affecting people and property in the next [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 2269.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how organizations can perpetuate disaster myths takes place in the days following a [[disaster]] and up until official numbers are compiled.  During this time, officials from emergency, relief, rescue, and welfare organizations can overestimate the loss of life and destruction of property.  This sheds a more positive light on their organizations since they can point to effective emergency procedures and local heroism as the reason their figures turned out to be higher than the actual numbers.  If their calculations end up being lower than the official figures, they might be blamed for incompetence and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the inability to cope by a disaster-site’s community and people is a myth, it continues to be believed.  One reason is the justification relief agencies give while promoting the assistance they provide.  They feel they are needed because they believe facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, and other local first responders do not have the capacity to meet the sheer demand from a disaster.  And if their efforts do not go as planned, they often point to survivors’ irrationality rather than reassess the assumptions on which they developed their relief plans.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local, regional, and national officials make up a primary source of information for the media.  In the self-imposed small window the media has to get out the latest details of the disaster, fact-checking sometimes suffers and they rely solely on the officials' accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, officials substantially influence the media's portrayal and what viewers, listeners, and readers see.  An example of this is seen in officials highlighting the positives within their own organization's efforts while downplaying the information from and activities by unofficial groups and sources.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Goltz, "Are the News Media Responsible for the Disaster Myths? A Content Analysis of Emergency Response Imagery," ''International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 2'', no. 3 (1984): 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by the media, law enforcement officials frequently say they are taking sufficient action to prevent [[looting]] even if they have taken no action on the issue.  If the norm happens and little to no [[looting]] occurs, they may be credited for the absence of crime.  But if the exception to the rule happens, they do not want to be blamed for not protecting against the [[looting]].  Whether it is true or not, people believe local law enforcement is out keeping the area secure from looters and the myth continues to propagate.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By media ===
Many myths are perpetuated by the mass media to include newspapers, television, radio, and internet news.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is largely due to the way they portray [[disaster]]s.  In fact, most people base their opinions and beliefs regarding [[disaster]]s and survivor behavior on what they see in the media.  The media strives to keep their viewers’ and readers’ attention for as long as possible.  Drama and destruction is interesting and compelling; most of everything else is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most part, the media, regardless of country, takes a fairly standard approach to disaster coverage and reporting.  Immediately after the [[disaster]], they rely on statistics of destruction and damage followed by stories of victims and those providing the rescue and relief.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media repeatedly moves away from discussing the [[disaster]] as a whole to focusing on individual parts and the drama involved in them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of its manner in covering [[disaster]]s, the media may capture only pieces instead of the entire event while emphasizing the unusually heroic or unusually tragic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A main focus of media coverage centers on [[emergency management]] organizations performing rescue and relief actions in the disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media frequently portrays international relief teams as angels saving the victims from the disaster's destruction while simultaneously implying the local officials are negligent, inept, or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this backdrop, the portrayal of a breakdown in society and social behavior is more likely to appear in coverage of [[disaster]]s occurring outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this type of portrayal that helps perpetuate disaster myths involves the frequent reports of people panicking in both small and large numbers to the point of fleeing when faced by an oncoming [[disaster]] such as a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when the international media noticed few stories of [[looting]] coming out of [[Japan]] following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan Disaster in 2011]], they generally remarked on how well the Japanese people behave.  By believing in this myth, they assumed the Japanese showed more behavioral control than other societies rather than understanding it rarely happens in association with any [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JENNY LIND HUMBUG.jpg|thumb|An 1850 cartoon of [[Jenny Lind]] outside [[P. T. Barnum]]'s New American Museum, New York City, 1850, captioned as a "Panorama of Humbug"]]
[[File:Magic vs Science.jpg|thumb|''Humbugging, or raising the Devil'', 1800. [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]]’s humbugging depicts the public as a credulous simpleton being distracted by a display of “the miraculous”, the better to have his pockets picked.]]
A '''humbug''' is a person or object that behaves in a deceptive or dishonest way, often as a [[hoax]] or in jest.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humbug|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/humbug|publisher=Collin's Dictionary|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first described in 1751 as student [[slang]], and recorded in 1840 as a "nautical phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Two Years Before the Mast | author=Dana, Richard Henry Jr. | authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. | year=1840|quote=When there is danger or necessity, or when he is well used, no one can work faster than he; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work for nothing, or, as the nautical phrase is, 'humbugged,' no sloth could make less headway.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also often used as an exclamation to mean [[nonsense]] or [[gibberish]].

When referring to a person, a humbug means a [[fraud]] or [[impostor]], implying an element of unjustified publicity and spectacle. In modern usage, the word is most associated with the character [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], created by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. His famous reference to [[Christmas]], '''"Bah! Humbug!"''', declaring Christmas to be a fraud, is commonly used in stage and television versions and also appeared frequently in the original book. The word is also prominently used in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in which the Scarecrow refers to the Wizard as a humbug, and the Wizard agrees.

Another use of the word was by [[John Collins Warren]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] professor who worked at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. Warren performed the first public operation with the use of [[ether]] anesthesia, administered by [[William Thomas Green Morton]], a dentist. To the stunned audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Warren declared, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=William |title=The Genealogy of Mass General |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/genealogy-mass-general?page=5 |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume=35 |issue=6 |year=1984 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The oldest known written uses of the word are in the book ''The Student'' (1750–1751), ii. 41, where it is called "a word very much in vogue with the people of taste and fashion", and in Ferdinando Killigrew's ''The Universal Jester'', subtitled "a choice collection of many conceits ... bon-mots and humbugs" from 1754; as mentioned in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' from 1911, which further refers to the ''New English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Humbug |volume=13 |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories as to the origin of the term, none of which has been proven:
* [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] mentions the idea that the word could be derived from the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''hum'', meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word ''bugges'' (used in the Bible), a variant of ''bogey'', meaning 'apparitions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling'' [1891], Chapter X [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gsft/gsft12.htm of ''The Haunts, Homes, and Habits of Witches in The South Slavic Lands--Bogeys and Humbugs'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse word ''hum'' mentioned, or ''hume'', actually means 'dark air' in [[Old Norwegian]]. From the other [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] based on Old Norse, there is ''húm'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] which means 'twilight', ''hómi'' in [[Faeroese language|Faeroese]] which means 'unclear', and ''humi'' in Old [[Swedish language|Swedish]] which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hum|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this word is also derived the Swedish verb ''hymla'', still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hymla|title='Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hymla|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' by [[Francis Grose]], 1731–1791, ''to hum'' in English indeed originally meant 'to deceive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dcvgr10.txt |title=Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combine this early medieval Scandinavian word with ''bugges'' from the English Bible of a later date may seem far-fetched. The word ''bug'' is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Bugge'' (of which the term ''[[Bogeyman|bogey]]'' is also derived) which is in turn a cognate of the German word ''bögge'' (of which ''böggel-mann'' (''"Goblin"'') is derived)&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Middle English Dictionary'' by Sherman M. Kuhn, Hans Kurath, Robert E. Lewis, University of Michigan Press, 1958, {{ISBN|978-0-472-01025-7}}, page 1212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary'', 11th edition, Merriam-Webster, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-809-5}}, page 162&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Norwegian dialect word ''bugge'' meaning "important man".&lt;ref name=merriamwebster&gt;''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'', Merriam-Webster, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-603-9}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh ''bwg'' (''"ghost"'') could also be connected,&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bug |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought in the past to be the origin of the English term however more recent studies indicate that it is a borrowing from the much older Middle English word.&lt;ref&gt;''Metatony in Baltic, Volume 6 of Leiden studies in Indo-European'' by Rick Derksen, Rodopi, 1996, {{ISBN|90-5183-990-1}}, {{ISBN|978-90-5183-990-6}}, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog   : English bogey from a Slavonic root?'', Brian Cooper 1, Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Correspondence to Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Northern English Lexis: A Literary Corpus-Based Study'', Javier Ruano-Garcia, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3-0343-0058-1}}, {{ISBN|978-3-0343-0058-2}}. pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in folk life'', John Geraint Jenkins, Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate, Ayer Publishing, 1977,{{ISBN|0-405-10102-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-405-10102-1}}. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with ''bug'' meaning ghost or goblin, the use of the term applies in Dickens' novel about the Christmas ghosts. In ''Etym. Diet.'' of 1898, [[Walter Skeat]] also proposed a similar theory, although using contemporary versions of the words, where ''hum'' meant to murmur applause, and ''bug'' being a spectre.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* It could also come from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''uomo bugiardo'', which literally means 'lying man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/dictionary/brewers/humbug.html |title=Factmonster |publisher=Factmonster |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable Italian influence on English at the time (e.g. Shakespeare's numerous Italian-based plays, approximately 150 years before the first recorded use of 'humbug').
* ''Uim-bog'' is supposed to mean 'soft copper' in [[Irish language|Irish]], worthless money, but there is no evidence of a clear connection to the term.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' also suggests that it is a form of "[[Hamburg]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; where false coins were minted and shipped to England during the Napoleonic wars, which is inaccurate as the Napoleonic wars occurred 50 years after the word first appeared in print.
* A modern conception is that it actually refers to a humming bug—''i.e.'' something small and inconsequential, such as a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], that makes a lot of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/012504.html#humbug |title=word-detective |publisher=word-detective |date=2004-01-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', there is a large beetle-like insect known as the Humbug, who is hardly ever right about anything.

The word has been used outside of anglophone countries for well over a century. For instance, in Germany it has been known since the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Horst Conrad |url=http://www.etymologie.info/~e/u_/us-ismen_.html |title=etymologie.info |publisher=Etymologie.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden since at least 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=humbug|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)
* [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]], between Venezuela and the United Kingdom
* [[Fashoda Incident]] (1898–1899)
*[[Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03]], between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy
* [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (1904–1906)
*[[Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908]], between Venezuela and the Netherlands
* [[Bosnian crisis]] (1908–1909)
* [[Agadir Crisis]] (1911)
* [[Åland crisis]] (1916–1920)
* [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] (1936)
* [[Anschluss]] (1938)
* [[May Crisis 1938|May Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland Crisis]] (1938)

On June 7, 2010, Jesus Mesa Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol agent, shot and killed Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on the concrete riverbed separating Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and  El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national was standing on the Mexican side of the [[US-Mexico border|Mexico–United States border]], while the agent was on the American side. The agent claimed after the shooting that he had used deadly force because Guereca had been throwing rocks.
The shooting led to a protracted court case which examined whether the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] protected Guereca's life even though he was not standing on US soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Preston|first=Julia|date=30 June 2014|title=Texas: Panel Rules Agent Can Be Sued Over Shooting Teenager Across Border|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/texas-panel-rules-agent-can-be-sued-over-shooting-teenager-across-border.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2014|title=Court: Mexican family can sue over fatal Border Patrol shooting|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/07/01/court-mexican-family-can-sue-over-fatal-border-patrol-shooting/|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2014|title=Mexican teenager killed by US Border Patrol agents had rights, court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/mexican-teenager-killed-us-border-patrol-agents-constitution|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Inskeep|first=Steve|date=9 Jun 2014|title=After Shootings, Extended Silence: What The Border Patrol Hasn't Said|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/09/320220093/foi-request-sheds-some-light-on-border-patrol-shootings|newspaper=[[NPR]]|accessdate=3 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 February 2017 |title=Supreme Court seems split over Mexican teen's shooting death by Border Patrol agent|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-seems-split-in-case-of-boys-death-near-us-mexico-border/|newspaper=[[CBS]]|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leander William Tomarkin''' (13 December 1895 – 1967) was a Swiss [[impostor]] who claimed to possess a doctorate in medicine, as well as to have invented a miracle medicine for the cure of [[typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], [[meningitis]], and [[malaria]]. He ascended to become the personal physician of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], king of Italy, and he convinced [[Albert Einstein]] to become patron of a conference organised by him.

==Early life==

Leander Tomarkin was born on 13 December 1895 in [[Zollikon]], Switzerland. A doctor's son, he was the black sheep of the family, obtaining bad results at school and dropping a chemistry degree at college. He also soon developed a reputation of dishonesty. He did not take up regular employment but spent his time in his father's laboratory, hoping to invent something.&lt;ref name="Dreist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/tb/29653/hochstapler-leander-tomarkin-der-erfinder-des-antimicrobum.html|title=Doktor Dreist|trans-title=Doctor Brazen|last=von Lüpke|first=Marc|date=1 November 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomarkin rose to fame when he offered to cure [[Pope Benedict XV]]{{'s}} [[pneumonia]] in January 1922. The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his ''Antimicrobum tomarkin'' medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As a result the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the [[Santo Spirito, Rome|Santo Spirito]] hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

==Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research==

In May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed ''Catalysan'' and ''Disulphamin'', claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in [[Locarno]] started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. In 1931 [[Albert Einstein]] assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

At the onset of [[World War II]] Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his [[Jew]]ish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured [[antibiotics]] in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and [[synthetic diamond]]s but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

[[Aircraft hijacking]] incidents between the United States and [[Cuba]] were at their height between 1968 and 1972. These incidents have variously been attributed to [[terrorism]], extortion, flight for political asylum, mental illness, and transportation between the two countries as a result of the ongoing antagonistic [[Cuba-United States relations]] and the Communist government restrictions against Cubans attempting to leave Cuba.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf Testing a rational choice model of airline hijackings] Study of data  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822080601/http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent measures by both governments contributed to a gradual reduction of reported incidents towards the mid-1970s. Governmental measures included an amendment to [[Cuban law]] which made hijacking a crime in 1970, the introduction of metal detectors in U.S. airports in 1973, and a joint agreement between the U.S. and Cuba signed in Sweden to return or prosecute hijackers.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Below is a non-comprehensive list of hijacking incidents of aircraft between Cuba and the United States.

'''Games with concealed rules''' are [[game]]s where the [[Game#Rules|rules]] are intentionally concealed from new players, either because their discovery is part of the game itself, or because the game is a hoax and the rules do not exist. In fiction, the counterpart of the first category are games that supposedly do have a rule set, but that rule set is not disclosed.

==Actual games==

===Discovery games===
* [[Eleusis (card game)|Eleusis]]: A card game in which one player secretly decides on a rule which determines which cards may be played on top of each other. The other players then use deductive logic to work out the secret rule.
* [[Haggle (game)|Haggle]]: A party game in which the [[Gamemaster]] divides a set of cards and a subset of the full rules among players and allows them to trade for other cards and rules. 
* [[Mao (card game)|Mao]]: A [[Shedding-type game|shedding-type]] card game where the winner of a round adds a concealed rule of their choice to all subsequent rounds.
* [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]: A [[tabletop role-playing game]] in which the rules are considered "classified". Only the [[Gamemaster]] has full knowledge of the rules, while other players must deduce them by trial and error as they proceed through the game. (The game acknowledges that players may read the gamemaster section, but ''demonstrating'' knowledge of the rules is considered treasonous, and the gamemaster may also make arbitrary changes.)
*[[Penultima]]: A chess variant in which the spectators make secret rules governing how the pieces move and capture. The two players are unaware of the rules and must discover them by inductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fryers |first1=Michael |year=1998 |title=Penultima |journal=[[Variant Chess]] |volume=3 |issue=28 |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scissors (game)|Scissors]]: A party game in which a pair of scissors is passed between players, with the passer declaring that they are being passed "open" or "closed" based on an individual and secret rule. The other players must use observation to deduce the rule each player uses to make the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/326383402.html?dids=326383402:326383402&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+15%2C+1899&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=TWO+JOLLY+GAMES%2C |title= Two Jolly Games, A Noisy Play Imported From Peru and 'The Spider And The Fly' |date= October 15, 1899 |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hofmann |first= Mary Christina |title= Games for Everybody |publisher= Dodge Publishing |location= New York |year= 1905 |url= https://archive.org/stream/games10/games10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whose Triangle Is It?: A party game in which one player points to three people or objects, forming an imaginary triangle, and then asks "Whose triangle is it?" The triangle belongs to the person closest to the closest object of a similar color to the color of second point of the triangle, but this rule is not told to new players, and the game is for new players to figure out what the rule is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |title= Mind Games |work= Yarps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Outbound Training |url= http://www.slideshare.net/outboundtraining/team-building-games-outbound-training |title= Team Building Games &amp; Activities |publisher= Slide Share}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]]: A game in which one player creates a rule for structures to follow and the other players try to discover the rule by building structures
* [[Snaps (game)]]: A game in which a player spells out a name using finger snapping and verbal cues.  Featured in [[P.S. I Love You (film)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snaps|title=How to Play Snaps.|publisher=WikiHow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax or joke games===
* [[52 Pickup]]: A card game in which dealer scatters the cards on the floor and non-dealer must pick them up.
* [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]: Originally a round in the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/|publisher= BBC |title= I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: A History |accessdate= July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of each panelist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The apparent aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern Line. Despite appearances, however, there are no rules to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of "rules" are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.

==Games in works of fiction==

===Games with undisclosed rules===
* [[43-Man Squamish]]: ''MAD Magazine'' published an article outlining a college sport designed to be unplayable. The sport features a pentagonal field, silly-sounding terms and a dummy on each team.
* [[Calvinball]]: In the comic series ''[[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]]'', ''Calvinball'' is a game regularly played by the main characters. The only consistent rule of ''Calvinball'' is that "Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice".
* [[Double Fanucci]]: Featured in the computer game [[Zork Zero]], ''Double Fanucci'' has mind-bogglingly complex "rules". Legal play can depend on things like the phase of the Moon and the ancestry of the players.
* [[Dragon Poker]]: A fictional card game by [[Robert Asprin]] in the [[MythAdventures]] series. The rules change depending on weather, seating position, time of day, and other undisclosed modifiers. However, a playable version has been created by fans, based on the rules and play that are presented in the books.

===Hoax games===
* [[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|Numberwang]]: A recurring "game show" on the sketch series ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|That Mitchell and Webb Look]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC - Numberwang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''Mornington Crescent'' above, the "contestants" call out random numbers in an attempt to score a "Numberwang", though the responses are scripted and there are no actual rules to winning a "Numberwang".
* Clique: The online satirical gaming magazine ''Critical Miss'' featured rules for a card game called Clique, a parody of collectible card games that used printed cards and spurious spoken rules to confuse onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue9/clique1.html|title=Clique: The Uncollectable, Unplayable Card Game|accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of games in Star Trek#Fizzbin|Fizzbin]]: In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "A Piece of the Action", [[James T. Kirk]] created this game while he and [[Spock (Star Trek)|Cmdr. Spock]] were being held prisoner. They "taught" the game to the guards, improvising the rules until their captors were sufficiently distracted, then overpowered them and escaped.

[[Image:I-45 &amp; Louetta Rita Evacuation.jpg|thumb|Evacuees fleeing [[Hurricane Rita]] in Texas, United States]]

This '''list of mass evacuations''' includes [[emergency evacuation]]s of a large number of people in a short period of time. An emergency evacuation is the movement of persons from a dangerous place due to the threat or occurrence of a disastrous event whether from [[Natural disaster|natural]] or [[Man-made hazards|man made]] causes or as the result of [[war]].

==Ancient times==
* 480 BC – The [[Greece|Greek]] officer of state and navy commander [[Themistocles]] ordered the evacuation of [[Athens]] as a strategic countermeasure to the approaching [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army, leading to 100,000 inhabitants being displaced in the late summer.

==1st century==
* 60–61 – [[Boudica's uprising]] results in the mass evacuation of numerous [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlements in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. 
* 79 – Eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] causes evacuation of [[Pompeii]] and surrounding areas.

==5th century==
* 410 – [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] by [[Visigoths]] under [[Alaric I]]. Many [[Rome, Italy|Romans]] were either taken captive and sold into slavery or later fled the devastated city.

==13th century==
* 1237–1293 – [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]: Many thousands in eastern [[Europe]] are displaced or flee before each of several Mongol expeditions.

==14th century==
* 1351 – Peak of the [[Black Death]], which [[Consequences of the Black Death|led to mass evacuations]] in numerous cities, ports, and villages in Asia, Europe, and [[Egypt]].

==19th century==
* 1836 – The [[Battle of the Alamo|Fall of the Alamo]] results in a mass evacuation of American, [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Tejano]], and [[Texian]] persons in what is known as the [[Runaway Scrape]].

==20th century==
[[File:Evacuees from Mount Pinatubo board the USS Abraham Lincoln.jpg|thumb|U.S. military dependents board {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72}} in the aftermath of the [[Mount Pinatubo#The 1991 eruption|1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]].]]
* April 20, 1906 – The resultant fire of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] leads to evacuation by sea of 20,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of the San Francisco Earthquake|publisher=The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/06timeline.html|accessdate=2007-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between March 1937 and October 1938, nearly 3,000 children were evacuated from [[Spain]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. Most of the children were from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Asturias]], and [[Cantabria]]. On June 12, 1937 over 1,500 children and 75 tutors (teachers, doctors, and nurses) left the Port of [[Santurtzi]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] province of [[Bizkaia]] on board the ship "Habana." Similarly, nearly 4,000 children were evacuated to the United Kingdom, also on the "Habana", with the [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS Hood]] as an escort. They became, and are still known as, "los niños de la guerra" ("the war children") or the "Gernika Generation" (as regards Basques).
* September 1939 – The [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II]]; at the outset of [[World War II]], [[London]] and major [[Great Britain|British]] cities were evacuated, with 1.5 million displaced in the first three days of the official evacuation. The final number of evacuees reached 3.75 million.
* 1939–1940 and June 1944 – The entire population of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Karelia]], 522,000 people, was [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated]] during the [[Winter War]]. Some 260,000 of these returned home during the [[Continuation War]], but were evacuated again in June 1944.
* May–June 1940 – [[Operation Dynamo]] was implemented, with around 439,000 British and French troops evacuated from [[Dunkirk, France]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18lsxFcDrjo&lt;/ref&gt;
* 20–23 June 1940 – 24,600 people, a third of the population, are evacuated from the [[Channel Islands]] to [[England]] and [[Scotland]] ahead of the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands#Invasion|German invasion]].
* October 1940 – 1945 – [[Evacuations of children in Germany during World War II]]
* October 1941 – A mass evacuation of [[Moscow]] was ordered in the face of the threat of the war estimated 1.5 million to 3 million [[Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]]. Two million inhabitants were displaced within two weeks.
*1942 – 1945 – Evacuation and deportation of [[Ingrian Finns]] from [[Ingria]] during and after World War II.

'''Maurice Gerald Flitcroft''' (23 November 1929 – 24 March 2007) was a British [[golf]]er and audacious [[hoax]]er.

Flitcroft became notorious after hitting a score of 121 in the qualifying competition for the [[1976 Open Championship]]—the highest score recorded at the [[Open Championship]]—and by a self-professed "professional golfer".&lt;ref name=Phantom&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|last2=Farnarby|first2=Simon|title=The Phantom of the Open|year=2010|publisher=Yellow Jersey Press|isbn=978-0-224-08317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he gained significant media attention, being referred to as "the world's worst golfer". Following the 1976 Open, the rules were changed to prevent Flitcroft from attempting to enter again. Undeterred, he regularly attempted to enter the Open and several other golf competitions, either under his own name or under pseudonyms such as Gene Paceky (as in paycheque), Gerald Hoppy, and James Beau Jolley.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt; Flitcroft was married to Jean (died 2002) by whom he had two sons—one of whom caddied for him.

He is the subject of a biography, ''The Phantom of the Open'', by Scott Murray and [[Simon Farnaby]], published by [[Yellow Jersey Press]] in July 2010.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt;

In his obituary, [[The Daily Telegraph]] commented thus:

:Maurice Flitcroft ...was a [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] shipyard crane-operator from [[Barrow-in-Furness]] whose persistent attempts to [[Gate crashing|gatecrash]] the British Open golf championship produced a sense of humour failure among members of the golfing establishment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1547158/Maurice-Flitcroft.html|title=Maurice Flitcroft|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Flitcroft was born in [[Manchester]] on 23 November 1929.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== The 1976 Open Championship ==
According to his unpublished memoirs, Flitcroft took up the game after watching the [[1974 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup |title=Crazy golfer |last=Murray |first=Scott |date=19 September 2008 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flitcroft had golfing ambitions well above his ability and came to notoriety in 1976 when, posing as a professional golfer, he managed to obtain a place to play in the qualifying round of [[The Open Championship]]—despite his previous experience amounting only to some hacking around on playing fields near his home. Flitcroft recalled, "I was looking to find fame and fortune but only achieved one of the two". He was inspired to enter the tournament by Walter Danecki, a postal worker from [[Milwaukee]] who, after being barred from becoming a professional by the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]], entered the [[1965 Open Championship]] after telling the R&amp;A that he was a pro and set a two-round score of 221 during qualifying.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt;

When he discovered, to his shock, that any amateurs entering competitions had to have an official [[Golf handicap|handicap]]—something he lacked—he simply declared himself to be a professional. It was in the same 1976 Open that a young new player, the 19-year-old [[Seve Ballesteros]] first came to the public's attention. Flitcroft prepared for the tournament by studying a golf instruction manual by [[Peter Alliss]] which was borrowed from his local library. He further studied from instructional articles by the 1966 [[PGA Championship]] winner [[Al Geiberger]], and honed his skills on a nearby beach.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

His deception (and ineptitude) were uncovered when he managed to card a 49-[[Over par|over-par]] 121—the worst score in the tournament's history; some of the other professionals playing with him were so angry that they successfully demanded a refund of their entry fees. In addition the R&amp;A gave him a lifetime ban from all their courses.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt; It seems that none of the professionals noticed that his gear comprised only a red [[Imitation leather|imitation-leather]] bag and half a set of [[Mail order|mail-order]] clubs. As a result of his abilities, he became known as "[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|The Royal &amp; Ancient]] Rabbit".

== Other work ==
After leaving school, Flitcroft joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. Following his marriage, he and his wife settled in Barrow-in-Furness, where he worked as a crane operator at the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] shipyard.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At other times he worked as a shoe polish salesman and an ice cream man.&lt;ref name=chortle&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/26939/the_worlds_worst_golfer,_coming_to_cinemas# |title=The world's worst golfer, coming to cinemas |last=Richardson |first=Jay |date=24 February 2017 |website=[[Chortle]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2006 article in Golfonline, Flitcroft said, "I was in show business. I toured with a [[revue]], and I used to jump into a tank on the stage, I was a stuntcomedy [[high diver]]. The revue used to tour all the country and I would dive into this tank. It wasn't all glass, just the front so the spectators could see what was going on under the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0,17742,1206885,00.html |title=Cloak and hacker |publisher=GolfOnline |first=Seth |last=Kelly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210007/http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0%2C17742%2C1206885%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After 1976 ==

After his initiation into celebrity golf, Flitcroft briefly became a C-list celebrity and had various golf trophies (usually those celebrating poor play or egregious mishaps) named after him; he also had the distinction of having the "Maurice Gerald Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament" named after him by the 1988 Blythefield Country Club in [[Grand Rapids]]. Buddy Whitten, Blythefield's head pro stated that, "It started as a lark, but most people can't break 90 so they relate more to Maurice than they would to a touring pro." By the time of the 22nd Maurice G. Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament, which was held in May 2000, the club had featured a [[Putting green|green]] with two [[Hole (golf)|holes]] so that even the most errant of approaches were potentially rewarded. If this wasn't enough another green had a {{Convert|12|in||adj=on}} cup.

In 1988, Flitcroft himself was flown to Blythefield to play in the event. He is reported as having told the members there that it was the first time he and his wife had been out of the house together "since their gas oven exploded." Whitten further said, "It was a different sort of experience, I'd never met a crane operator from England. But his game had gotten a little better than I expected. I think he shot in the low 90s." Flitcroft said of his performance, "I wasn't playing too well. Some faults had crept into my swing. But I hit a lot of good shots.”

Flitcroft retired from [[Vickers]] in the 1970s and devoted himself to his golf—but was reduced to the ignominy of once again playing on local fields, having been banned from every local golf club after sneaking into their grounds to play without permission.

Many years after his rise to fame, Flitcroft still received [[Mail|post]] which had been addressed simply to: Maurice Flitcroft, Golfer, England.

In 2017 comedian and writer Simon Farnaby, who co-wrote a biography of Flitcroft, stated that he was writing a film script based on the book.&lt;ref name=chortle /&gt;

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London’s [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his "first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer &amp; Shepherd-Wynn 2012, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 15, 2013 |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Prodigy Astronomer |url=http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182841/http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=Parlemagazine.com |accessdate=May 27, 2013 |archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was a faculty member at [[Cornell University]], tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies.&lt;ref name=Whitaker2000 /&gt; In his book, ''The Sky Is Not the Limit'', Tyson wrote:

{{quote|My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention.

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity.

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Space Chronicles|Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier]]'' Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [[Exploration of Mars|humans to Mars]], will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [[United States Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-how-space-exploration-can-make-america-great-again/253989/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: How Space Exploration Can Make America Great Again |first=Chris |last=Heller |website=theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Tyson collaborated with the organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA |url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted PETA an interview in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/05/peta-neil-degrasse-tyson-peta_n_912491.html |title=Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson Featured In PETA Ad |journal=Huffington Post |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/worlds-sexiest-astrophysicist-neil-degrasse-tyson-in-peta-ad-video.html |title="World's Sexiest" Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson In PETA Ad (Video)) |publisher=Treehugger |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |author=Kessler, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47915">''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' is an online team-based [[first person shooter]] developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], and released worldwide in May 2016. Normally played in matches of six-vs-six, players select from one of [[Characters of Overwatch|29 heroes]], broadly classified into the three categories of Tank, Damage, and Support, and work with their team to attack or defend map objectives. Each hero has a unique set of weapons, abilities, and skills, which players can coordinate to overpower the other team. ''Overwatch'' supports both casual and ranked matchmaking, as well as a rotating set of arcade modes, and the game has since become a popular [[eSport]], featuring a professional [[Overwatch League]] that started in 2018. The game has been both a critical and financial success for Blizzard, exceeding over 30 million players and obtaining over $1 billion in revenue within its first year.

To support ongoing interest in the game, Blizzard has run several seasonal events, typically coinciding with worldwide events and holidays. These events last for two to three weeks, updating [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to incorporate elements of that theme, and provide new game modes along with the opportunity to acquire unique cosmetic options. Players keep their earned character cosmetic options after the event ends, but the rest of the themed elements return to normal.

== Overview ==
Over the course of developing ''Overwatch'', Blizzard opted against using a [[downloadable content]] model to extend the game and bring post-sale revenues, as they had developed the game around the mechanic of allowing players to switch out to new heroes during the course of a match as to meet current strategic conditions; by requiring players to purchase new heroes, such a model would have hampered this approach.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: Development"/&gt; Instead, they opted to include [[microtransaction]]s through which players can buy [[loot box]]es, which contain four randomized cosmetic items, including characters skins, victory poses, emotes, spray tags, highlight introductions, and player icons. This allowed them to create an incentivized [[experience level|level progression system]] that would reward players with a loot box for every level they earned from experience gained in playing matches.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Progression"/&gt; Working alongside this, players can earn in-game coins through some loot box rewards or as a consolation prize for receiving a duplicate loot box reward. These coins can be used to purchase any of the available cosmetic items (with the exception of player icons), the cost reflecting the rarity of obtaining the item through a loot box.

Beginning in August 2016, Blizzard began introducing seasonal events, starting with the Summer Games event which corresponded with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. ''Overwatch''{{'}}s director Jeff Kaplan said the goal of these seasonal events was to make the game "feel alive", correlating with real-world events.&lt;ref name="VG247: Seasonal"/&gt; The company has a history of creating in-game seasonal events, such as the Valentine's Day and New Year's events in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Other competitor games, such as ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', also implement in-game seasonal events.&lt;ref name="IGN: more"/&gt;

Events have generally included at least one new game mode, which typically is only available to play while that event is active; one exception is the "Capture the Flag" mode introduced during the Chinese New Year event in early 2017, which has been brought back to the game as a permanent feature in the game's casual Arcade matchmaking mode. Players are typically rewarded with loot boxes for playing matches in these seasonal game modes, and the game offers unique [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] and associated cosmetic rewards for completing certain goals within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/173914/overwatch-uprising-achievements-how-to-unlock-all-the-new-event-sprays#.m0kj9F4sw|title=How to unlock all the new 'Overwatch' sprays during the Uprising event|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to new games modes, these seasonal events include unique cosmetic items that can be obtained primarily during the event. Blizzard develops a large amount of content for these events, not all which ends up available to players.&lt;ref name="USGamer: Events 2017"/&gt; Initially, these items could only be obtained through event-themed loot boxes that are guaranteed to contain at least one event-themed item, which could either be earned through leveling up, completing the event game modes, or through microtransactions;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer"/&gt; however, in response to player feedback and avoid an apparent [[paywall]] access to these items, Blizzard allowed players to purchase these items with in-game currency at a higher cost than a non-event item of the same rarity, starting from the second seasonal event onward.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer Problem"/&gt; When the event is completed, the themed loot boxes and cosmetic items are no longer are available until the event is run again. However, players retain and can use all unique event items they have earned after the event.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; Not all event items will be limited in this manner, as Blizzard plans to have certain event items be possible loot obtained from a regular loot box in the future.&lt;ref name="Kotatu: Special Skins to Regular Loot"/&gt;

Several seasonal events, such as Summer Games, Halloween Terror, and Winter Wonderland, have recurred. However, on bringing these events back, the development team has added new changes to the event to keep them fresh and to reflect any new heroes or other content added to the game since the previous event's occurrence; for example, the 2017 Halloween "Junkenstein's Revenge" included a new endless mode and support for some of the newer heroes.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Returning Seasonal"/&gt; Recurring events also feature new themed cosmetic items for these recurring events, along with the return of the previous cosmetics which can be found in the event loot boxes or bought for a reduced coin amount.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; Not all seasonal events are designed for recurrence, such as the lore-heavy "Uprising" event which took place in April 2017. Kaplan said that Blizzard has plans as to how these events will evolve in the future.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2016 events ==
=== Summer Games ===

In August 2016, Blizzard released its first seasonal event in celebration of the concurrent [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Both Blizzard's "Summer Games" and the Olympics ran throughout the month. Summer Games added 100 new cosmetic character options and a new game mode, Lúcioball.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;

Lúcioball was designed as a futuristic [[soccer]] game in which two teams of three Lúcio characters attempt to push a ball into their opponents' goal. Played in four-minute matches on the special stadium map, Estádio das Rãs, players use two kinds of attacks to control the ball's movements: primarily, a melee attack and a secondary, powerful sonic boom that could knock back opponents as well (frequently called "booping" by players). Players can also use the level's environmental perks (e.g., jump pads and speed-boosting walls) to secure strategic advantage on the field.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' felt that the mode felt closer to a "multiplayer carnival game than a fleshed-out, standalone mode".&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror ===

Blizzard released its second seasonal event for [[Halloween]], which lasted throughout the month of October 2016. It included over 100 new cosmetic items (in [[jack-o'-lantern]]-themed loot boxes) and the game's first [[player versus environment|game mode against computer players]], Junkenstein's Revenge.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt; Several characters received new Halloween-themed cosmetic skins. ''PC Gamer'' wrote that they were among the game's best add-ons,&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt; and ''[[Kill Screen]]'' felt the new character skins were much more enjoyable compared to those offered for the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="Kill Screen: Halloween"/&gt; Players could now purchase the seasonal add-ons with in-game credits (at a premium), in response to criticism Blizzard received from players during the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt;

In Junkenstein's Revenge, four players [[co-op video game|cooperatively]] guard a castle door from oncoming waves of enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. Set in a themed section of the game's Eichenwalde map, players select a [[difficulty level]] and choose between the characters [[Ana (Overwatch)|Ana]], [[Hanzo (Overwatch)|Hanzo]], [[McCree (Overwatch)|McCree]], and [[Soldier:_76]], before fighting off approaching mindless "zomnic" drones, long-range "zombardiers," exploding tires, and costumed versions of the characters [[Reaper (Overwatch)|Reaper]], [[Roadhog (Overwatch)|Roadhog]], [[Symmetra (Overwatch)|Symmetra]], [[Mercy (Overwatch)|Mercy]], and [[Junkrat]] (as the titular Dr. Junkenstein).&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; The game mode includes new voice work and is based on a companion comic book released concurrently.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

The new mode was generally praised by commentators. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that the event resembled a similar event run on the team shooter ''Team Fortress 2'' since 2012. Though the reviewer found the Junkenstein mode pleasant, he wrote that in comparison to ''Team Fortress 2''{{'s}} [[Mann vs. Machine]] mode, Junkenstein felt "shallow" and similar to Lúcioball in its simplistic map flow, giving little room for player movement. He also wondered why the mode was limited to four specific characters.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Robert Purchase found the event fun and considered it a good distraction from ''Overwatch''{{'}}s main modes, but also recognized that if it was kept on after the Halloween Terror event, it would become a stale game mode.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Halloween"/&gt; Heather Alexandra for  ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the mode demonstrated that a co-operative player-versus-environment mode would fit well as a permanent feature within ''Overwatch'' as it required good team coordination to complete more challenging matches.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween"/&gt;

The event ended a few hours earlier than had been planned, leaving some players upset as they were waiting for as long as possible collecting the themed loot boxes in-game before trying to spend in-game coins or purchasing loot boxes to get the cosmetic items they were missing.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween early end"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland ===
The holiday-themed Winter Wonderland event ran for the latter half of December 2016 through the first days of the new year. Like previous events, it added over 100 themed cosmetic items for players to obtain via loot boxes or in-game currency, as well as provided snowy versions of two of the game's maps.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; One cosmetic items included the first Legendary skin for Mei since the game's release, a Santa-like outfit; with this skin equipped, it also changed the appearance of Mei's Cryo-Freeze from a simple block of ice to a frozen snowman.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Players criticized the skin, feeling that it did not vary as much from Mei's normal outfits and appeared to be a simple recoloring of her default skin, in comparison to what other characters' Legendary skins had been.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Blizzard admitted that their "'cool meter' was off" when they designed this skin, believing that players would take to the Cryo-Freeze effect as a reason to value the skin. Blizzard stated that they had plans for another Mei Legendary skin, along the lines of what players would expect, in early 2017.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei Response"/&gt;

The event featured a new [[deathmatch]] mode called "Mei's Snowball Offensive". The mode took place on the smaller Ecopoint: Antartica map, introduced in the previous months for standard deathmatch play. Six players each play Mei, but where her Endothermic Blaster, which normally fires a stream of damaging cold, can only fire a single snowball. Players must find a snowball pile scattered around the map to reload the weapon. Further, her Ultimate ability allows her to fire a machine-gun-like string of snowballs for a brief period. Otherwise, Mei's other abilities (Ice Wall and Cyro-Freeze) remain the same. A single snowball hit kills the struck until the round is complete.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; Kotaku claims this mode was generally not well received by players as the act of having to reload the Blaster made one too vulnerable, and with the [[permadeath]] mechanic in play, the mode was not fun nor captured the spirit of a snowball fight.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter"/&gt;

== 2017 events ==
=== Year of the Rooster ===
A [[Chinese New Year]]-themed event launched a few days before the actual holiday on January 28, 2017, and centered on celebrating the Year of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]. As with past events, the Chinese New Year event introduced over 100 new cosmetic items, including the promised new Legendary skin for Mei to make up for the poorly-received one she had gotten during the Winter Wonderland event.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY"/&gt; Other skins for Roadhog, Reinhardt, Winston and Zenyatta alluded to the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Leak"/&gt;

The event introduced the first [[Capture the Flag]] mode for ''Overwatch'' called "Capture the Rooster"; Blizzard had looked at adding such a mode for a few years during ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development but had difficulty with the mechanics due to the vastly different set of abilities offered by the characters that could imbalance the mode towards fast-moving characters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF"/&gt; Played on the Lijiang Tower map, normally used for Control modes, each team has a flag near their base. To capture the other opponent's flag, a character must stay near the flag and not take damage for a few seconds. Once they have taken the flag, they then must return it to their team's base, scoring a point if they do so. If they die while bringing the flag back, either a teammate can try to capture it, or the opposing team must stay near the flag, avoiding taking damage for a few seconds, to return it to their base. Teams can score with the opposing team's flag even if their team's flag has been taken. The first team to three scores, or the team with the highest score after five minutes, wins the match.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Start"/&gt;

Following the event, Blizzard introduced a more general Capture the Flag mode, playable on any of the Control maps, into the Arcade modes as well as making it an option for custom games with several adjustable parameters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF added"/&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Uprising ===
Uprising ran for most of the month of April 2017, and was the first seasonal event not tied to any real-world event, but instead used to expand the lore of ''Overwatch''. The story centered around one of the last official missions of the Overwatch team before they were disbanded—having to end the threat of a hostile Omnic force known as the Null Sector in its attack on the citizens of London—; which also happened to be [[Tracer (Overwatch)|Tracer]]'s first mission. Over 100 new cosmetic items were added with this event, many based on the uniforms and backstory of the original Overwatch forces.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt; A digital comic retelling this story was released alongside the event.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt; According to Kaplan, the Uprising event was something Blizzard felt had been asked for by players since they started offering the seasonal events. Players had requested non-holiday-themed events, as well as sought more details on the setting and history of the ''Overwatch'' world.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt;

The event added a new cooperative player-versus-environment mode called "Uprising", played on the King's Row map set in London. In the standard mode, which can be played at one of four difficulty levels, four players select from the characters of Tracer, [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]], [[Torbjörn (Overwatch)|Torbjörn]], and Mercy. From there, the players are directed by in-game narration to take several control points while fighting against waves of Null Sector Omnics that try to stop them. Eventually, they must then escort an explosive weapon to a sealed door in order to access the heart of the Null Sector facility and end their threat for good. If a player was downed, any of the other still-surviving players could help them up by interacting with that character for a few moments (or through Mercy's Ultimate ability of Resurrection). If all four players are downed, or the explosive is destroyed before reaching the sealed doors, the round ends as a loss.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising"/&gt;  A separate mode allowed players to complete the same mission without being limited in character selection, but without any of the character-specific dialogue; Blizzard added this based on feedback from Junkenstein's Revenge, so as to provide a less restrictive way to enjoy the game mode.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising"/&gt;

The Uprising mode was considered a much-improved version of a player-versus-environment mode compared to Junkenstein's Revenge from the Halloween event. Cecilia D'Anastasio for ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt the mode was much more dynamic since it required players to move throughout the map rather than stay in one general location, and as the four default characters represent a balanced team, the mode calls for more careful teamwork and strategy. D'Anastasio also felt that with new voice lines to support this mode, it helped to establish the game's lore for players.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising Review"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' argued that the Uprising event demonstrated the potential for a strong team-based story-driven campaign developed within the ''Overwatch'' narrative.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising Review"/&gt;

The event had mistakenly ended a few hours earlier than expected on May 1, 2017; Blizzard apologized and extended the event for an additional day into May 2 to allow players to finish acquiring and purchasing the event loot boxes and skins.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising Ended"/&gt;

While the event was just named "Uprising" at its release, Blizzard stated in 2018 that they considered it to be the first "''Overwatch'' Archive" annual event that will be used to explore the history of the characters and narrative.&lt;ref name="polygon archives"/&gt;

=== Anniversary ===
The Anniversary event, ran from the end of May 2017, celebrated ''Overwatch''{{'}}s first year since release. Gameplay-wise, it added three new Arena maps used for the smaller-scale Elimination games, and which will remain in rotation after the events' conclusion. The Eliminate mode also received two variants. In one-on-one "Limited Duel" matches, each player is presented with the same selection of three random heroes for play for that round. In three-on-three "Lockout Elimination", the heroes used by the winning team on a round are locked out for the next round.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt;

In addition, over one hundred new cosmetic items are available, including new dancing emotes for each of the characters.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt; The dance emotes were found to evoke references to popularized dance moves in other works, such as Mei's dance being similar to the "Hare Hare Yukai" dance used at the end credits for the anime ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance 2"/&gt;

=== Summer Games 2017 ===
A second Summer Games event was held from August 8 to August 29, 2017.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt; This event brought back the 3-on-3 soccer-like mode, Lucioball, introduced from the first Summer Games, adding additional arenas for the event to be played in, but removing the ability to "boop" other players.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; In addition to casual matchmaking for Lucioball, Blizzard also introduced a ranked play system for Lucioball, separate from the game's normal Competitive mode. By participating in this "Copa Lucioball" mode, players earned Competitive Points (CP), the same in-game currency earned playing Competitive matches, and used towards purchasing special weapon skins (such as golden weapons).&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

The previous skins and other cosmetic items offered from the first Summer Games were made available again to obtain in loot crates or purchasable from in-game coins at a lower cost, while additional Summer Games skins were added, purchasable at their normal cost.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2017 ===
The Halloween Terror 2017 event ran from October 10 to November 2, 2017. The event brought back "Junkenstein's Revenge" from the previous year's event, but added an endless-mode variant that challenges players to defend the door through as many waves as possible. This mode allowed players to have four additional characters to select from, Genji, Torbjorn, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta, in addition to McCree, Soldier: 76, Ana, and Hanzo. Teams lasting the longest were tracked via an online scoreboard.&lt;ref name="VG247: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

New skins and cosmetic items were added to the event, along with the items from the previous Halloween Terror. With the exclusion of the tombstone victory poses introduced in the previous event, all these could be obtained from loot boxes or in-game coin purchase. Blizzard opted to remove the tombstone victory poses from loot box rewards as they believed these no longer fit with the characters' personalities, but still allowed players to purchase them in-game.&lt;ref name="Dot Esports: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland 2017 ===
The winter-focused "Winter Wonderland 2017" event ran from December 12, 2017 through January 1, 2018. It brought back the previous year's "Winter Wonderland" content, including the "Mei Snowball Offensive" mode and previous cosmetic items, along with new skins and other cosmetics. It also added a new Arcade mode, "Yeti Hunter". In this [[asymmetric gameplay|asymmetric mode]], five players, each playing as [[Mei (Overwatch)|Mei]], attempt to defeat one player controlling [[Winston (Overwatch)|Winston]] (acting as the Yeti) in a boss battle on Nepal's Village stage. Yeti Hunt is the first Overwatch mode to use role selection; players can indicate their preference to play as a Mei or as the Yeti. The Winston player must elude the Mei team, which can freeze him, use ice walls to impede his movement, or catch him in a snare trap (which replaces Mei's usual Ultimate). After collecting four pieces of meat, which spawn randomly in predetermined locations around the map, Winston unleashes his Ultimate ability for a short period which temporarily boosts his health, reduces his jump cooldown, and gives him powerful melee attacks. When a Mei player dies, they will respawn after a short delay and cost their team a life. The match is over once the Mei team either defeats Winston or loses all five of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter 2017"/&gt; Kaplan described the Yeti Hunt as a light-hearted mode to be played for a few matches rather than hundreds of hours.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2018 events ==
=== Year of the Dog ===
The Chinese New Year event reoccurred from February 8 to March 5, 2018, now reflecting the Year of the [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]].&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/lunar-new-year-seasonal-event-returns-to-overwatch-next-week-w516267 | title = Lunar New Year Seasonal Event Returns to 'Overwatch' Next Week | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = February 1, 2018 | accessdate = February 1, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; New cosmetic items relating to the theme were released, in addition to the existing cosmetics from the previous event. A new map, "Ayutthaya", inspired by [[Thailand]] and specifically designed for the Capture the Flag mode, was introduced in this event. Additionally, new Capture the Flag rules for all modes were updated, replacing the potential to have these end as draws by instead playing tie-breaking rounds with the teams' flags starting closer to each other on each subsequent round. The changes also eliminated the short period before players could pick up the flag, now able to pick up the flag instantaneously, but any use of a character's active skills or ultimate abilities that provide mobility or invulnerability would force them to drop the flag, and render the flag unable to be picked up for a few moments. These changes were to make games feel "much more offensive, and much more action-packed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/this-week-s-year-of-the-dog-event-in-overwatch-will-bring-a-new-map-486573.phtml | title = This week's Year of the Dog event in Overwatch will bring a new map | first = Jordan | last = Devore | date = February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 6, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a competitive mode for Capture the Flag, following a similar format as the competitive Lucioball mode in the 2017 Summer Games event, was run during the event, rewarding players with Competitive Points and unique items for the end-of-event placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/overwatch-celebrates-lunar-new-year-with-new-map-w516551 | title = 'Overwatch' Celebrates Lunar New Year With New Map and Capture The Flag Mode | first = Blake | last= Hester | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the event, Blizzard featured its inaugural "Puppy Rumble", modeled after the ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', on February 19, 2018, featuring puppies dressed in ''Overwatch'' character outfits in mock events. All of the animals during the event were put up for adoption through the event's co-sponsor [[Petfinder]], as well as promoting animal adoption through other local adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-puppy-rumble-celebrates-the-year-of-the-dog-with-real-dogs/ | title = The Overwatch 'Puppy Rumble' celebrates the Year of the Dog with real dogs | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = February 19, 2018 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Retribution ===
The ''Overwatch'' Archive event from the previous year returned, and ran from April 10, 2018. It brought back the narrative-driven player-versus-environment mode introduced in Uprising. It also featured a new mode titled "Retribution", which will take place on a new map, Rialto, which entered the game's map rotation as a Payload map outside of the Retribution event, on May 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-map-rialto-is-launching-this-week-f/1100-6458660/ | title = Overwatch's New Map, Rialto, Is Launching This Week For Everyone | first =Eddie | last = Makuch | date = May 1, 2018 | accessdate = May 1, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a four-player co-operative mode, based on the characters Reaper, McCree, Moira, and Genji as they escape from Talon forces; alternatively, this mode also includes an All-Hero mode where players can select any of the available characters. New skins and cosmetic items were available in loot boxes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/29/17176928/overwatch-uprising-event-start-date-2018 | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns in April | first = Allegra | last=  Frank  |date = March 29, 2018 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17189214/overwatch-archives-retribution-uprising-event | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns as Overwatch Archives | first=  Ryan | last = Gilliam | date = April 2, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/4/4/17193808/overwatch-archives-retribution-trailer-reveal-pve | title = Overwatch Archives: Retribution is this year’s Blackwatch PVE brawl | first=  Ryan | last = Gillian | date = April 4, 2018 | accessdate =April 4, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Retribution event was aimed to provide a more replayable experience compared to the prior Uprising event. This included eliminating the waypoint approach they as to reduce elements on the user interface and instead allow players to naturally figure out how to progress in the mission. They also included "specials", unique enemies with special abilities to pose an immediate threat to the players rather than just waves of strong enemies, and included an enemy [[artificial intelligence]] systems to better react to players, including in the All-Hero mode. Much of the ideas of this mode were based on concepts from the ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-retribution-development-heroes-specials-hanzo | title = Left 4 Dead was "a huge inspiration" for Overwatch Retribution | first = Matt | last=  Purslow | date = April 12, 2018 | accessdate = April 12, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anniversary 2018 ===
The second anniversary event ran from May 22 to June 11, 2018. Also with new cosmetic items, the event included a limited time competitive [[deathmatch]] mode with an exclusive map, Petra. In addition to previous Anniversary cosmetic items, all Anniversary loot boxes included cosmetic items from all previous seasonal events, and these are also available to buy with in-game gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/5/14/17348534/overwatch-second-anniversary-event-cosmetics-deathmatch-details | title = Overwatch’s second anniversary event starts May 22 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date =  May 15, 2018 | accessdate = May 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-skins-and-more-out-now-with-annivers/1100-6459128/ | title = New Overwatch Skins And More Out Now With Anniversary Event | first=  Patrick | last=  Faller | date = May 24, 2018 | accessdate = May 24, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer Games 2018 ===
The third Summer Games event ran from August 9–30, 2018. The Lucioball event returned with a new stadium map based on [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/8/2/17646222/overwatch-summer-games-2018-august-9th | title= Overwatch’s Summer Games return August 9th | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = August 2, 2018 | accessdate = August 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2018 ===
The 2018 iteration of Halloween terror ran from October 10–31, 2018. The Dr. Junkenstein's Revenge mode was updated to include changes made throughout the previous year, such as the changes to Symmetra. The player-versus-environment map remained largely unchanged, with the 2 modes and 4 difficulties each of the last year's event. Brigitte and Tracer were made playable for the game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/10/1/17922306/overwatch-halloween-terror-2018-event-date | title = Halloween Terror returns to Overwatch on October 9 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = October 1, 2018 | accessdate = October 1, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Precious Moloi-Motsepe''' is a [[South Africa]] fashion entrepreneur and a philanthropist. Her company ran the [[Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week]] in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

==Life==
Moloi-Motsepe was brought up in [[Soweto]]. Her father was a teacher and her mother was a nurse.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Opinion/winning-women-revving-africas-engine-20170903-2|title=Winning Women: Revving Africa’s engine|work=Fin24|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[University of the Witwatersrand|Wits University]] and became a hospital physician and general practitioner. In 1993 she opened a women’s health clinic in Johannesburg.&lt;ref name=award/&gt;

In 1989, she married [[Patrice Motsepe]], a lawyer who was also brought up in [[Soweto]].

''Forbes'' Magazine estimated her family's wealth at $2.5 billion and noted that they were South Africa's wealthiest black couple. They have said that they intend to donate half their wealth to charity.&lt;ref name="mag"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.africa.com/africas-top-power-couples/|title=Africa’s Top Power Couples|website=www.africa.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the head of the Motsepe Family Foundation in 2017. She has a strong interest in fashion and in 2007 she founded an organisation called [[African Fashion International]] which encourages young South African designers. She ran the [[Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week]] in her home city and in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/dr-precious-moloi-motsepe-celebrates-a-decade-of-fashion-with-afi-20170326|title=Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe celebrates a decade of fashion with AFI|work=Channel|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Cape Town event was abandoned by Moloi-Motsepe after high winds in March and rescheduled for the following April.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/03/25/mercedes-benz-fashion-week-cape-town-was-a-windy-mess_a_22011784/|title=Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Cape Town Was A Windy Mess|date=2017-03-25|work=Huffington Post South Africa|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case."&lt;ref&gt;The Age, Melbourne, 23 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Helsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by ngo’s , governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.

The '''Solomon curve''' is a [[graphical representation]] of the collision rate of automobiles as a function of their speed compared to the average vehicle speed on the same road. The curve was based on [[research]] conducted by David Solomon in the late 1950s and published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Solomon | title=Accidents on main rural highways related to speed, driver, and vehicle | date=July 1964, Reprinted 1974 | publisher=Technical report, U.S. Department of Commerce/Bureau of Public Roads (precursor to Federal Highway Administration)| work = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research suggests significant biases in the Solomon study, which may cast doubt on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement on Rural Roads | date=July 2001 | publisher=Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University | url=http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/ruralspeed/RURALSPEED.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original research ==
In 1964, Solomon researched the relationship between [[average]] [[speed]] and the [[collision]] [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] of [[automobile]]s and plotted the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Meyer | first = John Robert | authorlink = |author2=José A.

== Subsequent research ==
In 1968, Julie Cirillo conducted a similar study of 2,000 vehicles on interstate highways that addressed speed variation’s impact on crashes that involved two or more vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cirillo |first=J. A.|title = Interstate System Accident Research Study II, Interim Report II, Public Roads, 35 (3) |year = 1968|pages = 71–75 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cirillo data produced a U-shaped curve similar to the Solomon curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cost-Benefit Evaluation of Large Truck- Automobile Speed Limit Differentials on Rural Interstate Highways|journal=University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering|date=November 2005|first=Steven L.|last=Johnson|author2=Naveen Pawar|volume=|issue=|pages=Page 25|id=|url=http://ww2.mackblackwell.org/web/research/ALL_RESEARCH_PROJECTS/2000s/2048/Final%20MBTC%20Report%202048%2011-8.doc|format=MS Word|accessdate=2009-03-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051900/http://ww2.mackblackwell.org/web/research/ALL_RESEARCH_PROJECTS/2000s/2048/Final%20MBTC%20Report%202048%2011-8.doc|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Research Triangle Institute]] conducted a study in 1970 where data was collected on 114 crashes involving 216 vehicles on a state highway in Indiana to address these concerns by (1) combining automated, embedded speed-monitoring stations with trained on-scene crash investigators, and (2) distinguishing data on vehicles slowing to negotiate a turn from vehicles moving slowly in the flow of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Research Triangle Institute, "Speed and Accident, Volume II," Report No. FH-11-6965, National Highway Safety Bureau, June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on these results in 1971, academics West and Dunn confirmed the findings of Solomon and Cirillo,&lt;ref name="Impacts and Issues Related to Proposed Changes in Oregon’s Interstate Speed Limits"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.its.pdx.edu/speedlimits/final%20interstate%20speed%20review%20report%20(9.12).pdf | title=Impacts and Issues Related to Proposed Changes in Oregon’s Interstate Speed Limits | accessdate=3-1-2009 | author=Monsere, C. M., Newgard, C., Dill, J. Rufolo, A., Wemple, E., Bertini, R. L., and Milliken, C. | date=September 2004 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H4UFKRFH?url=http://www.its.pdx.edu/speedlimits/final%20interstate%20speed%20review%20report%20%289.12%29.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but found that crashes involving turning vehicles accounted for 44 percent of all crashes observed in the study and that excluding these crashes from the analysis greatly attenuated the factors that created the U-shape of the Solomon curve.&lt;ref&gt;West, L. B., Jr. and Dunn, J. W. (1971). "Accidents, Speed Deviation and Speed Limits." Traffic Engineering. 41 (10), 52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Fildes, Rumbold, and Leening collected self-reported crash data from 707 motorists in Australia with fewer than 200 reporting that they had been in a collision but, unlike Solomon and Cirillo, the researchers found no relationship between slower speeds and increased crash involvement.&lt;ref name="Speed Behaviour and Drivers’ Attitude to Speeding"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/reports/muarc016.html | title=Speed Behaviour and Drivers’ Attitude to Speeding | accessdate=3-2-2009 |vauthors=Fildes BN, Rumbold G, Leening A | date=June 1991 | location = Monash University Accident Research Centre, Victoria Australia, | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the many studies over the years, in testimony before the Ohio Senate Highways and Transportation Committee on June 10, 2003, Julie Cirillo, Former Assistant Administrator and Chief Safety Officer for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ([[FMCSA]]), testified that "up to the present time there has been no evidence to alter Solomon’s original finding that variance from the mean operating speed is a major contributor to accidents".&lt;ref name="Testimonyof2003"&gt;{{cite news|title=Testimony of Julie Anna Cirillo |date=2003-06-10 |publisher=OOIDA |url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Special_Reports/2003/June03/Cirillo_Testimony.htm |work=Land Line Magazine |pages= |accessdate=2009-03-02 |language= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040816035301/http://www.landlinemag.com/Special_Reports/2003/June03/Cirillo_Testimony.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Kloeden CN, Ponte G and McLean AJ of the Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University quantified the relationship, "... between free travelling speed and the risk of involvement in a casualty crash in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia" using a case control study design. They found, "..the risk of involvement in a casualty crash increased more than exponentially with increasing free travelling speed above the mean traffic speed and that travelling speeds below the mean traffic speed were associated with a lower risk of being involved in a casualty crash." Outlining past research in this area, they suggest that, in the Solomon research, "Both the numerator (number of crashes in a particular speed band) and the denominator (number of vehicle-miles travelled in that same speed band) may have been quite inaccurate for relatively low speeds." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement on Rural Roads | date=July 2001 | publisher=Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University | url=http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/ruralspeed/RURALSPEED.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical foundation ==
Hauer provided a theoretical foundation for the Solomon curve in 1971—“for example, if I drive at 45 mph, while the [[median]] of the pack is 60 mph, how many cars will pass me in an hour and hence have a chance to collide with me?”—that showed that the theoretical [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] was nearly identical to the Solomon curve.&lt;ref name="Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFhkehz-Ky0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=%22The+Solomon+Curve%22 | title=Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy | accessdate=3-1-2009 |author1=John Robert Meyer |author2=José A. Gómez-Ibáñez |author3=William B. Tye |author4=Clifford Winston | pages=Page 276 | isbn=978-0-8157-3181-8 | date=1999-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implications ==
While Solomon’s research focused on speed deviation, and not speed per se, some commentators have cited Solomon’s research to support the conclusion that raw speed and crash risk are not directly related.&lt;ref name="Is speed killing us?"/&gt; On the other hand, while recognizing Solomon's research reveals the importance to safety of variability around average speed, Leonard Evans concludes in ''[[Traffic Safety and the Driver]]'' that control of absolute driver speed, and not variability, should be the primary focus of traffic safety regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Leonard| title = Traffic Safety and the Driver | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | year = 1991 | location = New York, New York | pages = 155–56 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=OyuGJJ6rKQ0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=%22Traffic+Safety+and+the+Driver%22+Solomon| isbn = 0-442-00163-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both views support the fact that the seminal research underlying the Solomon curve shows that the greater the difference between a driver’s speed and the average speed of traffic—both above and below that average speed—the greater the likelihood of involvement in a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Transportation Research Board | first = Committee for Guidance on Setting and Enforcing Speed Limits | title = Managing Speed | publisher = National Research Council (U.S.) | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pARs53U6NAQC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22drive+with+the+flow+of+traffic”+Solomon | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-309-06502-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many states and safety organizations advise drivers to “drive with the flow of traffic”.&lt;ref name="Testimonyof2003" /&gt;

'''The Fifth Column Podcast''' is an American politics, news and humor podcast founded in April, 2016.  The show is hosted by [[Kmele Foster]], with co-hosts [[Michael C. Moynihan]], [[Matt Welch]] and produced by contributor [https://www.anthonylfisher.com/ Anthony L. Fisher] and Daniel Bier.  The podcast is described as in each episode as an “...almost weekly thoughtful commentary on the news, those who make it and occasionally ourselves”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wethefifth.com/episodes/2018/3/12/stormy-social-media-q-mdf8t-gwmfc-mlw4s-dlwdt-xxtzd-psbc3-xmyrf-6ml8a-bgcn4-ns82z-ny8yb-ww44l-sr9ce-2zhfh-3zbfs-ez68r-zsjyw-ymsts-glnfc-p77pw-mwa47-hb2fy-85b74|title=116 w/ Harry Siegel "Soros' Paid Protest Mobs, Team Woke vs Team Resentment"|last=|first=|date=|website=wethefifth.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The show is closely associated with independent-leaning, libertarian and anarcho-capitalist ideology as presented by the show hosts and guests, but is not explicitly so. 

=== Background and Format ===
'''[http://wethefifth.com/ The Fifth Column Podcast]''' first aired on iTunes April 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition/id1097696129?mt=2|title=The Fifth Column Podcast - iTunes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show markets itself as “Analysis. Commentary. Sedition” on Instagram&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/we.the.fifth/|title=The Fifth Column Podcast - Instagram|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as “@MattWelch @mcmoynihan @Kmele pick apart the news, interrogate their guests and question just about everything #someidiotwrotethis” on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wethefifth|title=wethefifth - Twitter|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The introduction to the podcast typically describes itself as:  “…your almost weekly rhetorical assault on the news cycle, the people who make it and occasionally ourselves…”.  Credit for the shows creation has been attributed to the encouragement of [[Kennedy (commentator)|Kennedy]] (Lisa Kennedy Montgomery) and her husband Dave Lee, who are associates of the hosts.  The name of the podcast has been attributed to a suggestion by [[Katherine Mangu-Ward]] as revealed in Episode 13 (3:05 mark)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition/id1097696129?mt=2|title="Islamic [REDACTED] and OJ Simpson"|last=|first=|date=June 21, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The original music that opens and closes the podcast includes a soundbite of F.D.R.’s speech given 1940/05/27 warning prejudices exploited by Fifth [[iarchive:1940-05-27_FDR_Warns_of_Fifth_Column|Columnists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">[[File:Lockerbie disaster memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A memorial is often established to remember lives lost in a tragedy such as the [[Lockerbie air disaster]]]]
A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W. C. Ashley  |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-59473-240-9 |page=86 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Analemma fishburn.tif|right|thumb|An [[analemma]] illustrates the changing [[position of the Sun]] over the course of a year, as viewed from a fixed [[standard time|time of day]].]]

A '''year''' is the [[orbital period]] of the [[Earth]] moving in [[Earth's orbit|its orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]]. The current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

In [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.

A [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.

In astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.) Reprinted from: {{cite journal |first=George A. |last=Wilkins |url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf |title=The IAU Style Manual |year=1989 |journal=IAU Transactions |volume=XXB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''year'' is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the [[seasonal year]], the [[fiscal year]], the [[academic year]], etc. Similarly, ''year'' can mean the orbital period of any [[planet]]; for example, a [[Martian year]] and a [[Venus|Venusian year]] are examples of the time  a planet takes to    transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "year", entry 2.b.: "''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
English ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''ġēar'' ({{IPA|/jɛar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''ġēr'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*jǣran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#ē₁ and ē₂|ē₁]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ran&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
Cognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''jār'', [[Old Norse]] ''ár'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:𐌾𐌴𐍂|jer]]'',&lt;!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--&gt; from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh₁-|*yeh₁r-om]]}}'' "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''yārǝ'' "year", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὥρα}} (hṓra) "year, season, period of time" (whence "[[hour]]"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jarŭ'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' "of this year". &lt;!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁ey-]] "go", needs reference to deal with the "laryingealistic" problems--&gt;

Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''annī'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''annō'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h₂et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''aþn'' "year" (only the dative plural ''aþnam'' is attested).

Although most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh₁r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh₁-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh₁-ro-'' and ''*h₂et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", ''*h₁ey-'' and ''*h₂et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''éti'' "goes", ''atasi'' "thou goest, wanderest").
A number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means "each year", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means "in the year of the Lord".

The Greek word for "year", {{lang|grc|ἔτος}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' "old", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' "year", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' "year" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' "bull calf",  English ''wether'' "ram" (Old English ''weðer'', Gothic ''wiþrus'' "lamb").

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:年|年]] "year", originally [[:wikt:秂|秂]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/godъ|godŭ]]'' "time period; year" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/lěto|lěto]]'' "summer; year".

In the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.

== Intercalation ==
No astronomical year has an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months, so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.

=== Julian calendar ===
In the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name "[[Leap Day]]" is applied to the added day.

The [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, 
has 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;).
In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Miriam Nancy. (1924). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924PA.....32..407S "The New Calendar of the Eastern Churches], ''Popular Astronomy'', Vol. 32, p.407. Courtesy NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gregorian calendar===
The Gregorian calendar attempts to cause the [[northward equinox]] to fall on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the [[tropical year|northward equinox year]], or [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziggelaar, A. (1983). [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=209 "The Papal Bull of 1582 Promulgating a Reform of the Calendar"]. In Coyne, Hoskin, Pedersen (eds), ''Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican Conference to Commemorate its 400th Anniversary''. Vatican City: Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Specolo Vaticano, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years,   the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is {{gaps|365.242|5}} days; with a relative error below one [[Parts per million|ppm]] (8·10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;)  relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ({{gaps|365.242|19}} days) and even closer to the current ''March equinox year'' of {{gaps|365.242|374}} days that it aims to match.   It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.

===Other calendars===
{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}
Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.
Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).

A modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.

==Year numbering==
A [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.

The worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]] era (but the label [[Common Era]] is preferred by some). It was historically introduced in the 6th century and intended as counting years from the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P. K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly state Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does state on page 585 the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes; the Gregorian calendar is used with the Anno Domini era.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] "in the year of the Lord"), or alternatively CE for "[[Common Era]]. Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].
Year numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no "year zero".
In the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], −1 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.

==Pragmatic divisions==
Financial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.

=== Fiscal year ===
A [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.

For example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.

=== Academic year ===
An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].

Some schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.

== Astronomical years == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] --&gt;

=== Julian year ===
{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}
The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit "year" (symbol "a" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].

In the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.

:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]

The [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.

=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===
{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}

Each of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.

The [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service. (2010).[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html IERS EOP PC Useful constants.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean [[ecliptic longitude]] of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G. (2013). Calendars. In S. E. Urban &amp; P. K. Seidelmann (Eds.), ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (3rd ed.). Mill Valley, CA: University Science Books. p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#longitude-ecliptic longitude, ecliptic]" and "[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#dynamical-equinox dynamical equinox]". (2018). In "Glossary", ''The Astronomical Almanac Online''. United States Naval Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt; the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.&lt;ref&gt;

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is {{val|365.259636}} days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).&lt;ref&gt;

The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is
:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).

This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Full moon cycle ===
The [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:
:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 34 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Lunar year ===
The [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].
A Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.

=== Vague year ===
The vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center&lt;/ref&gt;   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.

=== Heliacal year ===
A heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Sothic year ===
The [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.

=== Gaussian year ===
The [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:
:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).

=== Besselian year === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] --&gt;
The [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280°. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):&lt;ref&gt;

=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.
* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.
* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.
* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].

An average Gregorian year is 365.2425 [[day]]s (52.1775 [[week]]s, {{val|8765.82}} [[hour]]s, {{val|525949.2}} [[minute]]s or {{val|31556952}} [[second]]s).  For this calendar, a common year is 365 days ({{val|8760}} hours, {{val|525600}} minutes or {{val|31536000}} seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ({{val|8784}} hours, {{val|527040}} minutes or {{val|31622400}} seconds).  The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has {{val|146097}} days and hence exactly {{val|20871}} weeks.

== Seasonal year ==
{{Further|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a [[month]] from year to year.

== Symbols ==
In the [[ISO 80000-3|International System of Quantities]] the symbol for the year as a [[unit of time]] is ''[[a (year)|a]]'', taken from the Latin word ''annus''.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;

The joint document says that definitions such as the Julian year "bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth’s orbital movement", but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 AD (specified down to the millisecond), which suffers from the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norman E.

==== SI prefix multipliers ====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous]], from [[Template:Geologic time scale]] and from [[Theropoda]]. --&gt;
For the following, there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels, such as ''kilannus'', ''megannus'', etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.
* {{Anchor|Kiloannus|Kiloannum}} '''''ka''''' (for kiloannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[thousand]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E3 yr, also known as a [[millennium]] in [[anthropology]] and calendar uses. The prefix multiplier "ka" is typically used in geology, paleontology, and [[archaeology]] for the [[Holocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[period (geology)|periods]], where a non−[[radiocarbon dating]] technique: e.g. [[ice core]] dating, [[dendrochronology]], [[uranium-thorium dating]], or [[varve]] analysis; is used as the primary dating method for age determination. If age is primarily determined by [[radiocarbon dating]], then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years [[Before Present]].
* {{Anchor|Megaannus|Megaannum}} '''''Ma''''' (for megaannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[million]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E6 yr. The suffix "Ma" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as geology, paleontology, and [[celestial mechanics]] to signify very long time periods into the past or future. For example, the [[dinosaur]] species ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was abundant approximately 66 Ma (66 million years) ago. The duration term "ago" may not always be indicated: if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term, one can assume that "ago" is implied; the alternative unit "mya" does include "ago" explicitly. It also written as "million years" (ago) in works for general public use. In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author.
* {{Anchor|Gigaannus|Gigaannum}} '''''Ga''''' (for gigaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years. "Ga" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and geology to signify extremely long time periods in the past. For example, [[history of the earth|the formation of the Earth]] occurred approximately 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years) ago.
* {{Anchor|Teraannus|Teraannum}} '''''Ta''''' (for teraannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] years. "Ta" is an extremely long unit of time, about 70 times as long as the [[age of the universe]]. It is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small [[red dwarf]].
* {{Anchor|Petaannus|Petaannum}} '''''Pa''''' (for petaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[10^15|quadrillion]] years. The half-life of the nuclide [[cadmium|cadmium-113]] is about 8 Pa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = P.

 |quote=(c) Convention and abbreviations. – The age of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event, as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale, may be expressed in years before the present. The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with "a" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; years), Mega-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years), and Giga-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English "[[:wikt:year|year]]", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "22,000 years ago" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] ("BP") date.

Use of ''mya'' and ''bya'' is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being ''Ma'' and ''Ga'' for dates [[Before Present]], but "m.y." for the duration of epochs.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strat" /&gt; This ''ad hoc'' distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geological Society of America|title=Time Units|url=http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|accessdate=February 17, 2010| archivedate=June 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616100504/http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that on graphs, using ''ya'' units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left, which may seem counter-intuitive. If the ''ya'' units are on the vertical axis, time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

'''''You Me Bum Bum Train''''' is an [[Interactive theatre]] performance devised by Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd in 2004. The pair met as art students in Brighton, where they were studying illustration and film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/you-me-bum-bum-train-all-aboard-for-the-ride-of-a-lifetime-a2473106.html ''Evening Standard'' interview, 11 August 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''You Me Bum Bum Train'' gained critical acclaim in the United Kingdom when it was awarded the [[Samuel Beckett Award|Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |title=Barbican announces Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust award-winner|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730232240/http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while showing in a disused office in London. In 2010 it won the [[Evening Standard Theatre Award]] for outstanding newcomer. 

It returned in 2012 in a former postal depot in [[Holborn]], and a new version of the show – at Empire House in Stratford, east London in 2012 – was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |title=Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre - Olivier Awards|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402194001/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the show was mounted again, this time in at what had been [[Foyles]] bookshop on London's [[Charing Cross Road]] where their last show, started on 25 February 2016, finished on 29 April.

==Overview==
Visitors to the performance pass through a series of scenes of which they have no foreknowledge, in which they are either passive or where they must improvise a part without any preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Dickson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/11/best-theatre-2012-you-me-bum |title=Best theatre of 2012, No 9: You Me Bum Bum Train &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna Hanra, writing for ''Vice'', described it as a series of "highly detailed, absurd real life scenarios following one another on a nonsense high-paced narrative".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/you-me-bum-bum-train-378 ''Vice'' interview, 19 June 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The entertainment magazine ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' reported; "What was one of London's more obtuse treasures is set to become one of Great Britain's proudest moments." ''[[The Times]]'' said; "It leaves you questioning everything, and it's lots of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/style/article1480556.ece|title=Album review|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] magazine wrote; "My highlight of 2008 was You Me Bum Bum Train, if only real life were that interesting."

==Controversies==
''You Me Bum Bum Train'' has provoked controversy due to the fact that none of the performers gets paid, though the directors stress that performers and crew are involved on a voluntary basis, that many are not trained professionals and that they are under no obligation to stay during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Laura|title=You Me Bum Bum Train gives actors a bad ride, says union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/13/you-me-bum-bum-train-equity|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=Theguardian.co.uk|date=13 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/07/equity-warns-sell-out-show-of-possible-minimum-wage-breach/|title=Equity warns sell-out show of possible minimum wage breach - News - The Stage|author=Natalie Woolman|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was criticized for its ticketing system which caused problems for ticket buyers in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/ticketing-bum-bum-train-fire/|title=Ticketing for You Me Bum Bum Train under fire - Carousel, News - The Stage|author=Matthew Hemley|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the trade union Equity criticised their £150,000 Arts Council England funding as YMBBT were advertising for professional dancers but were not paying them, despite selling tickets "at rates typical of a West End show." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-questions-arts-council-funding-decision/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/bum-bum-train-comes-fire-actors-union/agencies/article/1374456&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the trade union BECTU criticised YMBBT for "exploiting workers after advertising for unpaid production interns." BECTU launched an investigation concerning "the legality of the “outrageous” internships, which would see successful applicants work at least two days each week for a minimum four hours each day." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/bectu-launches-probe-exploitative-bum-bum-train-internships/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2016/alistair-smith-show-producers-pay-stance-hits-a-bum-note/&lt;/ref&gt;
