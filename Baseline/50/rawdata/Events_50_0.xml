      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6204">The '''1990 October Revolution Parade''' was the last parade commemorating the 1917 [[October Revolution]] during the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence. It celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the revolution. It was the first and last parade attended by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in his position as [[President of the Soviet Union]]. At the chimes of the [[Kremlin Clock]], Gorbachev gave an address to the nation. It would be the first and last time a Soviet leader made an address on [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] during an October Revolution parade. After the anthem was played, the commander of the parade Colonel General [[Nikolai Kalinin]] reported to the parade inspector [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Dmitry Yazov]]. Providing the music for the parade was the head of the central orchestra of the [[Moscow Military District]], Major General Nikolai Mikhailov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RedSamurai84|title=HD Final Soviet October Revolution Parade, 1990 Парад 7 Ноября|date=2016-05-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxZux1KLhAQ&amp;list=PL0g-YW_Z9IPCaYXm13-jBZ8ohjSHgCO5_&amp;index=31|accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempted assassination of Gorbachev ==
At 11:00 AM, an hour after the parade began, an attempt to kill President Gorbachev was made by Alexander Shmonov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rbth.com/politics_and_society/politics/2017/02/16/the-last-soviet-terrorist-the-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-gorbachev_703611|title=The last Soviet terrorist: The man who tried to assassinate Gorbachev|last=Levkovich|first=Yevgeny|date=2017-02-16|work=Russia Beyond The Headlines|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bullets he fired missed and he was tackled to the ground by crowds of demonstrators. Shmonov was the last would-be-assassin of the Soviet period before the USSR's dissolution in 1991. He was sent to forced treatment which took a heavy toll on his mental state. Three weeks prior to the parade, Shmonov bought a double-barreled hunting rifle. He took out his rifle and was spotted immediately by the police, and as he was taking aim, an officer ran over and jerked the rifle by the barrel as the crowd jumped on him. Soviet Central television did not broadcast the assassination attempt and resumed its regular broadcasting at 11:25 AM.{{refn|group=nb|"Broadcast television was interrupted at 11:10 a concert of classical music and resumed at 11:25."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%A8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87&amp;oldid=87373265|title=Шмонов, Александр Анатольевич|date=2017-09-01|website=Wikipedia|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=March 2017}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="97670">[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Maynard Keynes]]]]Following the global [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], there was a worldwide '''resurgence of interest in Keynesian economics''' among prominent economists and policy makers. This included discussions and implementation of economic policies in accordance with the recommendations made by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in response to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s—most especially [[Stimulus (economics)|fiscal stimulus]] and expansionary [[monetary policy]].&lt;ref name = "resurgence"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the Great Depression until the early 1970s, [[Keynesian economics]] provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. The influence of Keynes's theories waned in the 1970s, due to [[stagflation]] and critiques from [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] and other economists, who were less optimistic about the ability of interventionist government policy to positively regulate the economy or otherwise opposed to Keynesian policies. From the early 1980s to 2008, the normative consensus among economists was that attempts at fiscal stimulus would be ineffective even in a recession, and such policies were only occasionally employed by the governments of developed countries.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is the evidence of this consensus?|date=January 2017}}

In 2008, a rapid shift of opinion took place among many prominent economists in favour of Keynesian stimulus, and, from October onward, policy makers began announcing major stimulus packages, in hopes of heading off the possibility of a global depression. By early 2009 there was widespread acceptance among the world's economic policy makers about the need for fiscal stimulus. Yet by late 2009 the consensus among economists began to break down. In 2010 with a depression averted but unemployment in many countries still high, policy makers generally decided against further fiscal stimulus, with several citing concerns over public debt as a justification. [[Unconventional monetary policy]] continued to be used in attempts to raise economic activity. By 2016, increasing concerns had arisen that monetary policy was reaching the limit of its effectiveness, and several countries began to return to fiscal stimulus.

==Background==

===Competing views on macroeconomic policy===
Macroeconomic policy focuses on high level government decisions which affect overall national economies rather than lower level decisions concerning markets for particular goods and services.

Keynes was the first economist to popularize macroeconomics and also the notion that governments can and should intervene in the economy to alleviate the suffering caused by unemployment. Before the [[Keynesian Revolution]] that followed Keynes's 1936 publication of his ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]'', the prevailing orthodoxy was that the economy would naturally establish [[full employment]]. So successful was the revolution that the period spanning the aftermath of [[World War II]] to about 1973 has been referred to as the ''Age of Keynes''. Stagnating economic performance in the early 1970s successfully shattered the previous consensus for Keynesian economics and provided support for a counter revolution. Milton Friedman's [[monetarism]] school was prominent in displacing Keynes' ideas both in academia and from the practical world of economic policy making.

For an overview on the different perspectives concerning optimal balance between public and private power in the economy, see [[International political economy#Traditional approaches|liberal, realist &amp; Marxist]]. For more detail on specific systems of thought relevant to debate on this fiscal policy see [[Keynesian economics]], [[Monetarism]], the [[Austrian School]], [[New classical macroeconomics]], [[Real business-cycle theory]], and [[New Keynesian economics]]. A key common feature of the anti-Keynesian schools of thought is that they argued for policy ineffectiveness or policy irrelevance. Although the theoretical justifications vary, the various schools all hold that government intervention will be much less effective than Keynes had believed, with some advocates even claiming that in the long run interventionist policy will always be counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2010|loc= p.1 – 30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynesian economics followed on from the Keynesian Revolution. In contrast to the recent resurgence of Keynesian policy making, the revolution initially comprised a shift change in theory.&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|1989|loc= Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been several experiments in policy making that can be seen as precursors for Keynes' ideas, most notably President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s famous "[[New Deal]]" in the United States. These experiments had been influenced more by morals, geopolitics and political ideology than by new developments in economics, even though Keynes had found some support in the US for his ideas about counter-cyclical public works policy as early as 1931.&lt;ref name="Skidelsky 2003 loc= chpt. 29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2003|loc= chpt. 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gordon Fletcher, Keynes' ''General Theory'' provided a conceptual justification for New Deal-type policies which was lacking in the established economics of the day. This was immensely significant, as in the absence of a proper theoretical underpinning there was a danger that ''ad hoc'' policies of moderate intervention would be overtaken by extremist solutions, as had already happened in much of Europe.&lt;ref name="F1"/&gt; However, Keynes did not agree with all aspects of the New Deal; he considered that the almost immediate revival of business activity after the program's launch could only be accounted for by dangerous-to-rely-on psychological factors,&lt;ref name="Skidelsky 2003 loc= chpt. 29"/&gt; such as the boost to confidence effected by Roosevelt's inspiring oratory.

===Keynesian ascendancy 1941–79===
{{Main|Keynesian Revolution}}

[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|150px|Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] (left) with King [[George VI]]. Attlee based the British post-[[World War II]] economic policy on Keynes' ideas.]]

While working on his ''General Theory'', Keynes wrote to [[George Bernard Shaw]] "I believe myself to be writing a book on economic theory which will largely revolutionize, not I suppose at once but in the course of the next ten years – the way the world thinks about economic problems ... I don't merely hope what I say, in my own mind I'm quite sure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2009|loc= p. 12- 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes's ideas quickly became established as the new foundations for mainstream economics, and also as a leading inspiration for industrial nations economic policy makers from about 1941 to the midseventies, especially in the English speaking countries. The 1950s and 1960s period, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, to many appeared in retrospect to have been a [[Post–World War II economic expansion|golden age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|1989|loc= xx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, in contrast to the decades before [[World War II|WWII]], the industrialized world and much of the [[Developing country|developing world]] enjoyed high growth, low unemployment and an exceptionally low frequency of economic crises. In late 1965 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran a cover article with the title inspired by [[Milton Friedman]]'s statement, later associated with [[Richard Nixon]], "[[We are all Keynesians now]]". The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing, and reported that "Washington's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes's central theme: the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency, but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government." The article also states that Keynes was one of the three most important economists ever, and that his ''General Theory'' was more influential than the ''magna opera'' of his rivals – [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= We are all Keynesians now|accessdate=2008-11-13 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-5,00.htm |publisher=Time magazine | date=1965-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement by monetarism and new classical economics 1979–99===
{{Main|Post-war displacement of Keynesianism}}
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Hayek]], Keynes' leading contemporary critic. [[Milton Friedman]] began to take over this role by the late 1950s.]]

A swelling tide of criticism of Keynesian economics, most notably from [[Milton Friedman]], a leading figure of [[monetarism]], and the [[Austrian School]]'s [[Friedrich Hayek]], was unleashed by the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s. A series of events that contributed to this economic situation included Richard Nixon's imposition of [[Incomes policy|wage and price controls]] on 15 August 1971 and unilateral cancellation of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1972, his [[Nixon shock|ceasing the direct convertibility]] of the United States dollar to gold, as well as the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[recession]] that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dorey.

''Economics as ideology: Keynes, Laski, Hayek, and the creation of contemporary politics''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2003. p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] of the [[Chicago school of economics]] introduced the [[Lucas critique]], which called into question the logic behind Keynesian macroeconomic policy making.&lt;ref name="Kumo"&gt;{{cite web

By the mid-1970s, policy makers were beginning to lose their confidence in the effectiveness of government intervention in the economy. In 1976 British Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] said that the option of “spending our way out of recession” no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= p. 107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as prime minister brought monetarism to British economic policy. In the US, the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] under [[Paul Volcker]] adopted similar policies of monetary tightening in order to control inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|1989|loc= xxi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of practical policy-making as opposed to economics as an academic discipline, the monetarist experiments in both the US and the UK in the early 1980s were the pinnacle of anti-Keynesian and the rise of [[perfect competition]] influence. The strong form of monetarism being tested at this time asserted that fiscal policy is of no effect, and that monetary policy should only try to target the money supply to control [[inflation]], without attempting to target real [[interest rate]]s. This was in contrast to the Keynesian view that monetary policy should target interest rates, which it held could influence unemployment.

Monetarism succeeded in bringing down inflation,&lt;ref&gt;The high interest rates under Volker have even been credited with causing [[The Great Moderation]]&lt;/ref&gt; but at the cost of unemployment rates in excess of 10%, causing the deepest recession seen in the developed countries since the end of the Great Depression and severe debt crises in the developing world. Contrary to monetarist predictions, the relationship between the money supply and the price level proved unreliable in the short- to medium-term. Another monetarist prediction not borne out in practice was that the [[velocity of money]] did not remain constant, in fact it dropped sharply. The US Federal Reserve began increasing the money supply above monetarist-advised thresholds with no effect on inflation, and discarded monetarism in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The End of the Age of Milton Friedman | accessdate=2008-11-13|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-madrick/the-end-of-the-age-of-mil_b_94228.html | publisher=Time magazine |first=Jeff |last=Madrick |date=2008-04-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081028172824/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-madrick/the-end-of-the-age-of-mil_b_94228.html| archivedate= 28 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Though the fed did not officially acknowledge they were unable to adhere to money supply targets until 1987 Bateman(2010) p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bank of England]] likewise abandoned its [[Pound sterling|sterling]] [[Money supply|M3]] money targeting in October 1985.

===Keynesian counter currents 1999–2007===
By 1999, the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and the harsh response by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) had already caused [[free market]] policies to be at least partially discredited in the eyes of developing world policy makers. The developing world as a whole stopped running current account deficits in 1999, largely as a result of government interventions to devalue the countries' currencies, which would help build foreign reserves to protect against future crises and help them enjoy export led growth rather than just rely on market forces.&lt;ref name="Wolf 2009 loc= p.31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2009|loc= p.31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advanced economies, while there was much talk of reforming the [[Global financial system|international financial system]] after the Asian crises, it was not until the market failure of the 2000 [[dot-com bubble]] that there was a significant shift away from free market policies.&lt;ref&gt;Though the shift was largely unnoticed both by the popular press and academic economists, see Bateman(2010), esp p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In America there was a return by the government of [[George W. Bush]] to a moderate form of Keynesian policy, with interest rates lowered to ease unemployment and head off recession, along with a form of fiscal intervention with emergency tax cuts to boost spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2010|loc= p. 9, 23 -26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Britain, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] had gone on record saying "the real challenge was to interpret Keynes's insights for the modern world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2009|loc= p18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet American and British policy makers continued to ignore many elements of Keynesian thinking such as the recommendation to avoid large [[Balance of trade|trade imbalance]]s and to reduce [[Government budget balance|government deficit]]s in [[Business cycle|boom]] years. There was no general global return to Keynesian economics in the first 8 years of the 2000s. European policy became slightly more interventionist after the start of the 21st century, but the shift in a Keynesian direction was smaller than was the case for the US and the UK. However, continental Europeans had not generally embraced free market thinking as wholeheartedly as had the [[English-speaking world]] in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2010|loc= p. 4, 51–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan had been using moderate Keynesian policies in the nineties, and switched to [[neoliberalism]] with the government of [[Junichirō Koizumi]] in 2001–06.&lt;ref name="Bateman 2010 loc= p. 4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2010|loc= p. 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first half of the 2000s, free-market influences remained strong in powerful normative institutions like the [[World Bank]], the IMF, and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Washington Consensus]] view that current account imbalances do not matter continued even in the face of a ballooning US deficit, with mainstream academic opinion only turning to the view that the imbalances are unsustainable by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2009|loc= p.114 – 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable anti-Keynesian view that remained dominant in US and UK policy making circles was the idea that markets work best if they are unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2010|loc= p. 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of popular opinion, there had been an upsurge in vocal but minority opposition to the raw free market, with [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization protests]] becoming increasingly notable after 1998. By 2007, there had been bestsellers promoting Keynesian or at least pro-[[mixed economy]] policies: [[Naomi Klein]]'s ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' and Song Hongbing's ''[[Currency Wars]]''.

In the academic world, the partial shift towards Keynesian policy had gone largely unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Bateman 2010 loc= p. 4"/&gt;

==On Keynesian resurgence==
In the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and the search for a way out of the crisis, a worldwide move toward Keynesian [[deficit spending|deficit]] financing and general resurgence of Keynesian policies resulted in a new economic consensus, which involved reassessment or even reversal of normative judgments on a number of topics. The Keynesian view receiving most attention has been [[Stimulus (economics)|fiscal stimulus]], [[National fiscal policy response to the Great Recession|applied by numerous states]] as a response to the [[Great Recession]]. The IMF managing director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] advocated for global fiscal stimulus already in January 2008.&lt;ref name="resurgence"/&gt;

Gordon Brown built support for fiscal stimulus among global leaders at September's [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], after which he secured George Bush's agreement for the first [[G-20 major economies|G20]] leaders summit.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008 and 2009 fiscal stimulus packages were widely launched across the world, with packages in G20 countries averaging at about 2% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], with a ratio of public spending to tax cuts of about  2:1. The stimulus in Europe was notably smaller than in large G20 countries elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2010|loc= 184-87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas where opinion has shifted back towards a Keynesian perspective include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/667/are-we-all-keynesians-now-political-ideology-and-state-deficit-spending-in-the-great-recession|title=Are We All Keynesians Now?

* ''[[Balance of payments#Imbalances|Global trade imbalances]]''. Keynes placed great importance on avoiding large [[Balance of trade|trade deficits or surpluses]], but following the ''Keynesian displacement'', an influential view in the West was that governments need not be concerned about them. From late 2008 imbalances are once again widely seen as an area for government concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2009|loc= p. 121-143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2010|loc= Chp 14, ''Current Global Imbalances: Might Keynes be of help'' by Anna M.

* ''[[Capital control]]s''. Keynes strongly favoured the use of controls to restrain international capital movement, especially short term speculative flows, but in the 1970s and 1980s opinion among Western economists and institutions swung firmly against them. During 2009 and 2010 capital controls once again came to be seen as an acceptable part of a government's macroeconomic policy toolkit, though institutions like the IMF still caution against overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* ''Skepticism concerning the role of mathematics in academic economics and in economic decision making.'' Despite his degree in [[mathematics]], Keynes remained skeptical about the usefulness of [[mathematical economics|mathematical models for solving economic problems]]. Mathematics, however, became increasingly central to economics even during Keynes' career, and even more so in the decades following his death. While the Keynesian resurgence has seen no general reversal of opinion on the utility of complex math, there have been numerous calls for a broadening of economics to make further use of disciplines other than mathematics. In the practical spheres of [[bank]]ing and [[finance]], there have been warnings against overreliance on [[mathematical model]]s, which have been held up as one of the contributing causes of the 2008–09 crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2009|loc= p. 29 – 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Manmohansingh04052007.jpg|thumb|150px|Economist and former prime minister of India [[Manmohan Singh]] spoke in favour of Keynesian fiscal stimuli at the [[2008 G-20 Washington summit]]]]
In March 2008, leading free-market journalist [[Martin Wolf]], chief economics commentator at the ''Financial Times'', announced the death of the dream of [[globalization|global free-market]] capitalism, and quoted [[Josef Ackermann]], chief executive of [[Deutsche Bank]], as saying "I no longer believe in the market's self-healing power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The rescue of Bear Stearns marks liberalization's limit|accessdate=2008-11-13|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8ced5202-fa94-11dc-aa46-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1| publisher=Financial Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward economist [[Robert J.

Much discussion among policy makers reflected Keynes's advocacy of international coordination of fiscal or monetary stimulus, and of international economic institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, which he had helped to create at Bretton Woods in 1944, and which many argued should be reformed at a "new Bretton Woods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was evident at the G20 and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] meetings in Washington, D.C., and Lima, Peru in November 2008, and in coordinated reductions of interest rates by many countries in November and December 2008. IMF and [[United Nations]] economists and political leaders such as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown advocated a coordinated international approach to fiscal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5572215.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Philippe | last=Naughton | title=UK recession unlike any other says Gordon Brown | date=2009-01-23| accessdate= 6 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Bank's President [[Robert Zoellick]] advocated that all developed countries pledge 0.7 percent of their stimulus package to a vulnerability fund for assisting developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/opinion/23zoellick.html?ref=opinion | work=The New York Times | first=Robert B. | last=Zoellick | title=A Stimulus Package for the World | date=2009-01-23| accessdate= 6 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Markwell]] and others argued that the absence of an effective international approach in the spirit of Keynes would risk a return of economic causes of international conflict, which Keynes had identified back in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first nation to  announce a substantial fiscal stimulus was Great Britain, with  [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Alistair Darling]] referring to Keynes as he unveiled plans for fiscal stimuli to head off the worst effects of recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Darling invokes Keynes as he eases spending rules to fight recession |accessdate=2008-11-13|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/economy-recession-treasury-energy-housing| publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Allegra | last=Stratton | date=2008-10-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023063713/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/20/economy-recession-treasury-energy-housing| archivedate= 23 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures were later described by [[Ed Balls]] as the first time a postwar British government had been able to meet a recession with a "classic Keynesian response".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Darling's stimulus announcement was swiftly followed by a similar declaration from China,  and over the next few weeks and months from European countries, the U.S. and other countries across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2008/11/09/china-stimulus-economy-biz-cx_pm_1109notes.html |title=China Announces Massive Stimulus Package |publisher=Forbes.com |author=Paul Maidment |accessdate=2008-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112053515/http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/11/09/china-stimulus-economy-biz-cx_pm_1109notes.html |archivedate=November 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered in March 2009 entitled ''Reform the International Monetary System'', [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]], revived Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global [[reserve currency]]. Dr Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that Keynes's [[bancor]] proposal was not accepted at [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] in the 1940s. He argued that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies as a result of the [[Triffin dilemma]] – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards adopting IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The People's Bank of China—Speeches |url=http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6500&amp;id=178 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327070907/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6500&amp;ID=178 |archivedate=2009-03-27 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderlini |first=Jamil |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7851925a-17a2-11de-8c9d-0000779fd2ac.html |title=China calls for new reserve currency |publisher=FT.com |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2009 the ''Financial Times'' reported that both government officials and private investors were seeing signs of recovery, such as rises in commodity prices, a 13% rise in the Chinese stock market over a period of 10 days, and a big increase in lending – reflecting the government's success in using state-owned banks to inject [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] into the real economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Reviewing events from 2010, economics commentator John Authers found that the stimulus and associated expansionary monetary policy had a dramatic effect in reviving the Chinese economy. The [[SSE Composite Index|Shanghai index]] had been falling sharply since the September 2008 [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]], but the decline was halted when news of the planned stimulus leaked in late October. The day after the stimulus was officially announced, the Shanghai index immediately rose by 7.3%, followed by sustained growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Authers|2010|loc= p. 159-166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Speaking at the 2010 [[World Economic Forum#Activities|Summer Davos]], Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] also credited the stimulus for good performance of the Chinese economy over the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As late as April 2009, [[central bank]]ers and finance ministers remained cautious about the overall [[World economy|global economy]], but by in May the ''Financial Times'' was reporting that according to a package of [[Economic indicator|leading indicators]] there were signs that recovery was imminent in Europe too, after a trough in March. The US was one of the last major economies to implement a major stimulus plan, and the slowdown there looked set to continue for at least a few more months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In an article looking back at 2009, economist [[Arvind Subramanian]] wrote in the ''Financial Times'' that economics had helped to redeem itself by providing advice for the policy responses that successfully prevented a global slide into depression, with the fiscal policy stimulus measures taking their "cue from Keynes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2010 economics journalist Robin Harding wrote for the ''Financial Times'' that most American economists are in agreement regarding the large influence of the US stimulus on the economy, though he mentioned high-profile dissenters such as [[Robert Barro]] and [[John B.

A July 2010 paper by [[Moody's Investors Service]]'s chief economist Mark Zandl and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman [[Alan Blinder]] predicted that the US recession would have been far worse without the government intervention. They calculate that in the absence of both a monetary and fiscal response, unemployment would have peaked at about 16.5% instead of about 10%, the peak to trough [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] decline would have been about 12% instead of 4%. Despite the lack of [[deficit spending]], without the intervention the 2010 and 2011 [[United States federal budget|US federal budget]] deficit was forecast to be almost two times larger, due to the predicted collapse of tax receipts.&lt;ref&gt;

===Calls for further extensions===
In 2009 there were several books published by economists advocating a further shift towards Keynesian thinking. The authors advocated further reform in academic economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= ''passim'', esp 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2009|loc= p. 29–45, 179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akerlof|2009|loc= ''passim'', esp p. 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
policy making&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= ''passim'', esp 168 – 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akerlof|2009|loc= ''passim'', esp p. vii – xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2009|loc= ''passim'', esp p 14–20, 134–151, 179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and even the public's general ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= ''passim'', esp p. 133–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theoretical arguments regarding the relative merits of [[free market]] versus [[mixed economy]] policies do not always yield a clear conclusion. In his 2009 book ''[[Keynes: The Return of the Master]]'', economic historian [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Lord Skidelsky]] has a chapter comparing the performance of the world economy between the "[[Post–World War II economic expansion|golden age]]" period of 1951–73, when Keynesian policies were dominant, with the [[Washington Consensus]] period of 1981–2008, when free market policies were adopted by leading governments. [[Samuel Brittan]] of the ''Financial Times'' called this part of the book the key chapter for the practically inclined reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Using data from the IMF, Skidelsky finds superior economic performance on a whole range of [[Performance metric|metrics]], except for inflation where he says there was no significant difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= p 116–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable sortable"

|Average unemployment (France)||1.2%||9.5%
|-
|Average unemployment (Germany) ||3.1% ||7.5%
|-
|Average unemployment (Great Britain) ||1.6% ||7.4%
|}

Skidelsky suggests the high global growth during the golden age was especially impressive given that during that period Japan was the only major Asian economy enjoying high growth – the exceptional growth of China and other Asian emerging economies, raising the global average, happened later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= p. 116–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also comments that the golden age, compared with other periods, was substantially more stable. [[Martin Wolf]] found that in 1945–71 (27 years) the world saw only 38 financial crises, whereas in 1973–97 (24 years) there were 139.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2009|loc= p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skidelsky also reports that inequality was generally decreasing during the golden age, whereas since the Washington Consensus was formed it has been increasing. He notes that South America has been an exception to the general rise in inequality – since the late 1990s inequality has been falling there, which [[James K. Galbraith]] explains as likely due to the region's early [[Pink tide|"retreat from neoliberal orthodoxy"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc= p. 123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 book ''The Keynes Solution'', [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] economist [[Paul Davidson (economist)|Paul Davidson]] makes another historical case for the effectiveness of Keynesian policy, referring to the experience of the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. He notes how economic growth and employment levels increased for four successive years as the [[New Deal]] policies were pursued by President Roosevelt. When government spending was cut back in 1937 due to concerns about the budget deficit, all the gains were lost in one year, and growth only resumed after spending increased again from 1938, as a response to growing acceptance of deficit spending in a recession and later due to [[World War II]]. For Davidson, this experience validates the view that Keynesian policy has the power to deliver [[full employment]] and prosperity for a government's entire labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2009|loc= p. 18-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson also wrote that both price stability and employment in the Keynesian age were superior even to the classical [[gold standard]] era that was terminated by [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 8 November 2008, Paul Davidson and Henry C.K. Liu co-authored an open letter to world leaders attending the November 15 [[White House]] summit on financial markets and world economy, urging reconsideration of Keynes' analytical system that contributed to the golden age of the first quarter century after World War II. The letter, signed by many supporting economists, advocates a new international financial architecture based on an updated 21st century version of the Keynes Plan originally proposed at [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1944.

The letter ends by describing this new international financial architecture as aiming to create (1) a new global monetary regime that operates without currency hegemony, (2) global trade relationships that support rather than retard domestic development and (3) a global economic environment that promotes incentives for each nation to promote full employment and raise wages for its labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==In academia==
A marked shift towards Keynesian thinking took place among prominent economists. Some, such as Paul Krugman, James Galbraith and Brad Delong, were already Keynesians, but in 2008 began to get considerably more attention for their advocacy of Keynesian policy. Others, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Martin Feldstein]], had previously been associated with anti-Keynesian thinking, yet by 2009 publicly converted to Keynesian economics, which made considerable impact on other economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner's 2009 book, ''[[A Failure of Capitalism]]'', was a critique of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and its ideologues.&lt;ref name="questions"&gt;"Seven questions for Richard Posner," Interview with Richard Posner, ''[[The Economist]]'', 6 June 2009, found at [https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/06/seven_questions_for_richard_po.cfm ''The Economist'' website]. Accessed September 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift towards Keynesian thinking was widely shared by many politically active economists across the world. In the years leading up to the resurgence, Germany had been home to some of the most outspoken critics of Keynesianism, yet according to economist Sebastian Dullien writing in December 2008, "important voices in the German economic profession are now calling for a large stimulus package, passed as quickly as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that in the March 2008 annual meeting of the [[American Economic Association]], economists had remained hostile or at least sceptical about the government’s role in enhancing the market sector or mitigating recession with fiscal stimulus. But already during the January 2009 meeting virtually everyone voiced their support for such measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/business/economy/07spend.html?_r=2&amp;ref=economy |title= Economists Warm to Government Spending but Debate Its Form |publisher= New York Times |author= Louis Uchitelle | authorlink=Louis Uchitelle |accessdate=2009-03-11 | date=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a few high-profile known dissenter economists, such as Robert Barro and [[Eugene Fama]],  but in 2008 and early 2009 their objections had little influence on the mainstream debate. A dissenter from Germany had been [[Stefan Homburg]], who in January 2009 complained "I simply cannot understand how so many economics professors have done a complete U-turn. Have they all gone mad?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Among the less publicly prominent economists, who tend to debate only with their fellows and write mainly in technical journals,  a substantial shift in opinion was less obvious. Speaking in March 2009, Galbraith stated that he had not detected any changes among academic economists, nor a re-examination of orthodox opinion in the journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/books/05deba.html?ref=books |title= Ivory Tower Unswayed by Crashing Economy |publisher= New York Times |author= Patricia cohen |accessdate=2009-03-14 | date=2009-03-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131018060708/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/books/05deba.html?ref=books| archivedate=October 18, 2013&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2008, the consensus among most mainstream economists was that fiscal stimulus did not work. [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesians]] and [[New classical macroeconomics|New Classical]] economists had previously agreed [[monetary policy]] was sufficient for most downturns and the two schools of thought debated only technicalities. The extent of the recession made the New Keynesians re-evaluate the potential of large stimulus, and their debates with New Classical economists, who often opposed stimulus entirely, became substantive.  Some economists (primarily [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesians]]) accused the New Keynesian system of being so integrated with pro-free market neo-classical influences that the label 'Keynesian' in this case could be considered a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rotheim | first = Roy | title = New Keynesian Economics/post Keynesian Alternatives | year = 1998 | chapter= passim, esp forward | pages = viii |publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 financial crisis has led  economists to pay greater attention to Keynes's original theories. In February 2009, Robert Shiller and [[George Akerlof]] argued in their book ''[[Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism|Animal Spirits]]'' that the current US stimulus package was too small, because it did not take into account loss of confidence or do enough to restore the availability of credit. In a September 2009 article for ''The New York Times'', on the lessons economists should learn from the crisis, Paul Krugman urged economists to move away from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] models and employ Keynesian analysis:&lt;ref&gt;

{{cquote|So here's what I think economists have to do. First, they have to face up to the inconvenient reality that financial markets fall far short of perfection, that they are subject to extraordinary delusions and the madness of crowds. Second, they have to admit ... that Keynesian economics remains the best framework we have for making sense of recessions and depressions. Third, they'll have to do their best to incorporate the realities of finance into macroeconomics.}}

By mid-2010, interest in Keynes' ideas was still growing within academia, even though the apparent consensus among prominent economists had fractured and the revival in Keynesian policy making had to some degree stalled.&lt;ref name="markets"&gt;{{cite web

==Criticisms==
Keynesian ideas also attracted considerable criticism in this time period. While from late 2008 to early 2010 there was broad consensus among international leaders concerning the need for coordinated stimulus, the German administration initially stood out in their reluctance to fully embrace Keynesian policy. In December 2008, Finance Minister [[Peer Steinbrück]] of Germany criticised Gordon Brown's advocacy of Keynesian stimulus, saying "The switch from decades of [[Supply-side economics|supply-side]] politics all the way to a crass Keynesianism is breathtaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[George Osborne]], at the time [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] British chancellor, opposed a return to Keynesian policy from as early as October 2008, saying "even a modest dose of Keynesian spending" could act as a "cruise missile aimed at the heart of recovery."&lt;ref name="D 177"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Critics argued that Keynesian policy would be counter-productive – for the reasons of being inflationary, creating more income disparity, and causing consumers to rein in their spending even more as they anticipated future tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/think-piece/economy/how-to-promote-the-free-market-in-2009/ |title=How to promote the free market in 2009 |publisher= The Adam Smith Institute |author= Tom Clougherty |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforliberty.com/article.php?view=15 |title=Tooth Fairy Economics |publisher=Campaign for Liberty |author=Tom Woods |accessdate=2009-03-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hQqEyFR1?url=http://www.campaignforliberty.com/article.php?view=15 |archivedate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, more than 300 professional economists, led by three [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureates in economics]], [[James M. Buchanan]], [[Edward C. Prescott]], and [[Vernon L. Smith]], signed a statement against more government spending, arguing that "Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Petition |url=http://www.cato.org/special/stimulus09/alternate_version.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5PAndsn?url=http://www.cato.org/special/stimulus09/alternate_version.html |archivedate=2009-09-26 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Barro, an economics professor at [[Harvard University]] (author of the 1974 [[Ricardian equivalence]] hypothesis postulating that government stimuli are inefficient in a perfect market), argued that US stimulus spending might be unwise because of one of the factors the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|US stimulus package]] depended on for its effectiveness, the "multiplier effect". The [[fiscal multiplier]], required to be over the value of one for the effect to take place, was in practice close to zero – not 1.5 as he said the Obama team were assuming – which means the extra employment generated by the stimulus would be cancelled out by less output and investment in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123258618204604599 |title=Spending Is No Free Lunch |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |author=[[Robert J.

&lt;/ref&gt; and economist Eugene Fama argued that stimulus plans are unlikely to have a net positive effect on employment, and may even harm it. Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] doubted a positive effect because the stimulus and associated policies "may work in the short term but they threaten to produce still greater crises within a few years".&lt;ref&gt;

There have also been arguments that the [[Great Recession]] of the early 21st century was caused not by excessively free markets but by the remnants of Keynesian policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?e6d31da4-0cd9-4587-a557-f4d3eb52292d |title=The Free-Market Hasn't Failed Us, Keynesian Economics Has |publisher=Hawaii Reporter |author=Chad Crosier |accessdate=2009-06-24 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iVbifEH5?url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?e6d31da4-0cd9-4587-a557-f4d3eb52292d |archivedate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luigi Zingales]] of the [[University of Chicago]] argued that "Keynesianism is just a convenient ideology to hide corruption and political patronage".&lt;ref name=TheEconomist&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, historian [[Thomas Woods]], an adherent to the [[Austrian School|Austrian school of economics]], published the book ''[[Meltdown (book)|Meltdown]]'', which places blame for the crisis on government intervention and points to the Federal Reserve as the primary culprit behind the financial calamity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woods|2009|loc= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[John Bellamy Foster]], a sociologist, questioned whether the resurgence had been truly Keynesian in character. He suggested those few economists he regards as genuinely [[Progressivism|progressive]], such as James Galbraith, were now far from the centre of government. He also asserted that it is [[Karl Marx]], not Keynes, that society should look to for a full solution to economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;

==Aftermath: 2010 and later==
According to [[Henry Farrell (political scientist)|Henry Farrell]] and [[John Quiggin]], by late 2009 the previous apparent consensus for Keynesian policy among prominent economists began to dissolve into "dissensus". There was no reversal to the previous free market consensus, but the apparent unity of the previous year had gone. In part this was due to objections from anti-Keynesians like Robert Barro attracting wider attention, in part to the intervention of elite economists who had previously kept out of the debate (specifically from the [[European Central Bank|ECB]], but also others, including Jeffery Sachs). The lack of consensus among expert opinion made policy makers vulnerable to calls for abandonment of Keynesian policy in favour of fiscal consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In April 2010 a communiqué from the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] meeting of finance ministers called for continuation of the stimulus policies until the recovery is firmly entrenched with strong private sector activity, though it accepted that some countries had already begun to exit from the policies. By mid-2010, the earlier global consensus for ongoing Keynesian stimulus had fractured, mirroring the "dissensus" that had emerged among prominent economists.

Especially in Europe, there was an increase in rhetoric calling for immediate fiscal tightening, following events such as the [[European debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]] and the displacement of the UK [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government with a coalition dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 elections]]. While some high level officials, particularly from the US and India, continued advocating sustained stimulus until the global recovery is better established, a communiqué from the G20, issued after their June 2010 meeting of finance ministers in [[Busan]], welcomed the trend towards fiscal consolidation rather than further deficit financed stimulus. The G20 did reiterate that forceful government intervention had been the correct response in 2008 and 2009. Then IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had been a leading advocate for stimulus spending from as early as January 2008, said he was comfortable with the reversal.&lt;ref name="resurgence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April 2011, Professor [[Patrick Dunleavy]] wrote that the resurgence has caused a "backlash against the State", starting in America with movements like the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and later spreading to Europe.

In September, [[Steven Rattner]] opined that the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 US presidential election]] was shaping up to be a contest between the economic policies of Keynes and Friedrich Hayek - "a clash of ideologies the likes of which America has not seen in decades." Republican candidates openly praised Hayek and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. According to Rattner, while the Democrats economic strategy remained largely based on Keynes, the economist's name was now rarely mentioned; "Keynes" had become an almost politically toxic word due to the extensive criticism of the 2009 Keynesian stimulus. Rattner refers to the work of Alan Blinder and [[Mark Zandi]], which determined that the 2009 US stimulus saved about 8.5 million jobs, and with Obama's  third stimulus, a $450 billion ''Jobs plan'' was projected to create 1.9 million jobs in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Murphy sees the resurgence as having faded out by late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|2011|loc= ''passim'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential figures that had come out against Keynesian policy, even from left of center politics, include the UK Labour Party's [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|Maurice Glasman]], whose favorite economist is Hayek,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davis|2011|loc= xi, 55, 200  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2012, Philip Stephens repeated his earlier view that the markets once again have decisive influence on economic policy making, also noting a decline in the public's trust in government in both Europe and the US, along with greater concern over [[Government debt|public debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In March however, while accepting that the resurgence had stalled, Paul Krugman expressed optimism about the long term prospects of achieving a lasting shift towards Keynesianism in both mainstream economics and policy making.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In May, Krugman  published the book ''End this Depression Now!'', where he repeated his calls for greater use of fiscal stimulus, though according to the ''Financial Times'' his proposals were both "modest" and "cautious", reflecting the resistance to such measures since the end of resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In June Krugman and [[Richard Layard, Baron Layard|Richard Layard]] launched ''A manifesto for economic sense'', where they call for greater use of stimulatory fiscal policy to reduce unemployment and boost growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By mid-2012, with the ongoing [[European debt crisis|Euro crisis]] and persistent high unemployment in the US, there had been renewed consideration of stimulus policies by European and American policy makers, but no return to the pro-stimulus consensus that existed in  2009. After the [[38th G8 summit|2012 G8 summit]], leaders issued a statement recognising the range of opinions concerning the best measures to strengthen their economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

But at the same time the ''Financial Times'' published Wolfgang Münchau's article ''US joins misguided pursuit of austerity'', as the great power was abandoning the relatively stimulatory policy it had adopted prior to 2013, repeating, in the author's view, Europe's mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In July 2013, [[Philip Mirowski]] wrote that not only had the Keynesian resurgence subsided, but the rival economic orientation of [[neoliberalism]] had emerged from the financial crisis stronger than ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In May 2016, three IMF economists published new research findings and criticized some of the fundamental assumptions of the neoliberal doctrine. They warned that austerity policies could do more harm than good because of their social costs – increased inequality, which "in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth". Speaking of capital account liberalization, that is unrestricted movement of capital across international borders ("openness") and fiscal consolidation, meaning policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels ("austerity"), they wrote: "Since both openness and austerity are associated with increasing income inequality, this distributional effect sets up an adverse feedback loop. The increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, the very thing that the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth".&lt;ref name="neoliberalism oversold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm|publisher=International Monetary Fund, Finance &amp; Development|date=June 2016|accessdate=2016-06-01|authors=Jonathan D. Ostry, Prakash Loungani, Davide Furceri|title=Neoliberalism: Oversold?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, they recommended actively combating inequality by redistributing wealth via taxes and government spending, noting "the evidence of the economic damage from inequality suggests that policymakers should be more open to redistribution than they are" and "the fear that such policies will themselves necessarily hurt growth is unfounded".&lt;ref name="neoliberalism oversold"/&gt;

By October 2016 there had been recent increases in fiscal stimulus for many countries, along with calls for this return to fiscal stimulus and demand management policies to increase further, or at least for  further research into clarifying the scope for such policies to be effective. Sources for these calls included the [[IMF]],  [[Janet Yellen]] and senior Whitehouse economist [[Jason Furman]].  While some economists and government policy makers remain sceptical,  Martin Sandbu for the Financial Times said a return to Keynes original positive views about demand management is underway. Sandbu calls this "paleo-Keynesianism" to differentiate from "new Keynesianism" thinking which had relatively little to say in favour of state intervention in the economy.&lt;ref name = "return2016"&gt;{{Cite news

On 25 December 2016, a [[Tupolev Tu-154]] jetliner of the [[Russian Defence Ministry]] crashed into the [[Black Sea]] shortly after taking off from [[Sochi International Airport]], Russia, while en route to [[Khmeimim Air Base]], Syria.

On 27 December it was reported that an investigative source had told the [[Interfax]] news agency that Russian investigators believed a fault with the aircraft [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] had caused the crash. The Life.ru news portal was reported to have obtained a recording of the last words of one of the pilots: "Commander, we are going down." There was no official confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-airplane-black-box-idUSKBN14G0CY|title=Wing flap fault main theory behind Black Sea Russian jet crash|date=27 December 2016|agency=Reuters |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/flaps-damn-it-russian-pilots-last-words-before-tu-154-plunged-into-black-sea-1598312|title='The flaps, damn it,' Russian pilot's last words before Tu-154 plunged into Black Sea|first=Vasudevan|last=Sridharan|date=28 December 2016|work=International Business Times |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December it was announced by the Flight Safety Service of the Russian Ministry that a preliminary analysis of data from the cockpit voice recorder showed that no explosion had occurred on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/world/923191|title=Defense Ministry: Terror attack possibility in Tu-154 crash not discarded|agency=TASS|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January the [[Interstate Aviation Committee]], the civil authority in aviation accident investigation, announced that its representative would participate in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mak-iac.org/en/rassledovaniya/tu-154b-2-ra-85572-25-12-2016|title=TU-154B-2 RA-85572 25.12.2016 investigation|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January Interfax reported that, during the underwater search, remains had also been found of a Soviet [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas A-20 Havoc/DB-7 Boston]] bomber, supplied from the U.S. through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreement, which crashed on 15 November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.ru/russia/546071|title=Американский бомбардировщик времен войны найден под Сочи в ходе поисков Ту-154|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2017, Russia's ''[[Kommersant]]'' said all the evidence pointed to the pilot, Maj Roman Volkov having suffered from [[somatogravic illusion]]. Analysis of the flight data suggested that the pilot had "lost his bearings and ignored his instruments, believing that the jet was climbing too sharply." Tiredness was thought to be a factor. Experts said that he was already feeling unwell on the ground and had trouble getting the plane on to the correct runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kommersant.ru/doc/3313458|title=Управляемая катастрофа|language=Russian|date=31 May 2017|trans-title=Managed catastrophe |quote=The Commission fully confirmed as set out in the "b" version of another January 9 that managing their pilot lost orientation in space, hitting the power of the so-called somatogravic illusions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40117209|title=Russia Black Sea air crash: Pilot error blamed|publisher=BBC News|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/defence-ministry-says-december-plane-crash-caused-by-disorientation-58133|title=Deadly TU-154 Christmas Day Plane Crash Caused by Human Error, Says Russian Defence Ministry |publisher=The Moscow Times |accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhagat wrote this novel after quitting his job as an investment banker. This is his fourth book after ''[[Five Point Someone]]'', ''[[One Night @ the Call Center]]'' and ''[[The Three Mistakes of My Life]]''.

== Plot summary ==

2 States: The Story of My Marriage is partly autobiographical. The story is about a couple, Krish and Ananya, who fall from two different states of India, Punjab and Tamil Nadu respectively, are deeply in love and want to get married.

The story begins in the IIM Ahmedabad mess hall, where Krish, a Punjabi boy from Delhi sights a beautiful girl, Ananya, a Tamilian from Chennai, quarreling with the mess staff about the food. Ananya was tagged as the "Best girl of the fresher batch". They become friends within a few days and decide to study together every night. In the mean time, they become romantically involved. They both get jobs, and have serious plans for their wedding. At first Krish tries to convince his girlfriend Ananya's parents and at last convinces them by helping Ananya's father to do his first PowerPoint Presentation, her brother, Manju, by giving him IIT tuition and later convinces her mom by asking her to sing in a concert organised by Krish's off City at CitiBank. She is convinced as her biggest dream of singing at a big concert comes true. Then they try to convince Krish's mom. But the problem is Krish's mother's relatives who don't quite like this. They say that Krish should not marry a Tamilian but end up agreeing with them when Ananya tries to help one of Krish's cousin to get married and succeeds to do so. Krish has had a hatred on his father. He never shares his feelings or doesn't share a harmonious bonding with him. Now as they have convinced both their parents they now try to introduce each other's parents. They go to Goa. But this dream of theirs end as Ananya's parents finds something fishy between Krish's mom and him. Ananya's family end up deciding that Krish and Ananya will not marry each other.  Krish started becoming workaholic and started living badly. But, at last, Krish's father, who was like an enemy for Krish, helps Krish and Ananya to get married as he convinces Ananya's family well. Now Krish realizes his Dad's love for him. They really do very hard to convince each other's parents and finally make it. It is narrated in a first person point of view in a humorous tone, often taking digs at both Tamil and Punjabi cultures . The novel ends with Ananya giving birth to twin boys. He says that the babies belong to a state called 'India'; with a thought to end inequality.

==Film adaptation==
{{main|2 States (film)}}
When a film adaptation of the novel was first announced, it was to be directed by [[Siddharth Anand]] and the lead roles were played by [[Arjun Kapoor]] and [[Alia Bhatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/1245384/Saif--Priyanka-in-Siddharth-Anands-adaptation-of-Chetan-Bhagats-2-States|title=Saif &amp; Priyanka in Siddharth Anand's adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's '2 States' {{!}}  Bollywood News {{!}} Hindi Movies News {{!}} News - BollywoodHungama.com|last=Hungama|first=Bollywood|website=Bollywood Hungama|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music to be composed by [[Vishal Shekhar|Vishal-Shekhar]]. However, the project was called off due to creative differences over script.

Later, it was announced that the screen adaptation of 2 States would be produced by [[Sajid Nadiadwala]] with [[Shahrukh Khan]] and Priyanka Chopra in the lead roles and [[Vishal Bhardwaj]] would be directing the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Shah-Rukh-Khan-Priyanka-Chopra-re-ignite-2-States/articleshow/8960147.cms|title=Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra re-ignite 2 States | newspaper=Times of India|date=23 June 2011|first=Subhash K|last=Jha|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since Shahrukh Khan did not want to appear in back to back romantic movies, the director had to look at other options. It was later declared that [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]] will be playing the male lead in the movie. But then, due to clash of dates, Imran and Priyanka had to opt out of the movie as well. After a lot of brainstorming, it was finally confirmed by producers [[Karan Johar]] and [[Sajid Nadiadwala]] that [[Arjun Kapoor]] and [[Alia Bhatt]] will be seen playing the lead pair in the movie. [[Amrita Singh]] and [[Ronit Roy]] were cast as Arjun Kapoor's parents and [[Revathy]] and [[Shiv Kumar Subramaniam]] were cast as Alia Bhatt's parents.

This movie was released on 18 April 2014.

[[File:Daten_crash_recorder.jpg|thumb|Example of a data curve of a crash recorder that is recorded in a traffic accident.]]
The '''accident data recorder''' (ADR, German commonly abbr.: '''UDS''', also accident (data) writer),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Wolfgang Hugemann, Karl-Heinz Schimmelpfennig|Periodical=[[VKU Verkehrsunfall und Fahrzeugtechnik]]|Title=Der Unfallschreiber - Funktionsprinzipien, Genauigkeit, Auswirkung auf die Tätigkeit des Sachverständigen|Volume=30|Issue=2|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;49–59|Date=1992|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Switzerland also ''Restwegaufzeichnungsgerät'' (abbr.: RAG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragen rund um die Unfalldaten- (UDS) und Restwegaufzeichnungsgeräte (RAG) bei Feuerwehrfahrzeugen (Infoblatt der Aargauer Gebäudeversicherung)|periodical=agv-ag.ch|publisher=|url=https://www.agv-ag.ch/media/filer/pruefung_rag.pdf|deadurl=|format=PDF|accessdate=2018-09-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115045755/http://www.agv-ag.ch/fileadmin/NewsletterFeuerwehr/2010-01/Pruefung_RAG.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-15|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent electronic device that records before, during, and after a [[traffic accident]] relevant data and thus resembles a [[flight recorder]].

It can be installed in motor vehicles ([[cars]], [[trucks]], [[buses]], [[motorcycles]], [[trams]], and special vehicles) on a voluntary basis in order to obtain more accurate information about the events in an [[accident]]. In some countries there are regulations for mandatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art. 102 Datenaufzeichnungsgerät (Verordnung über die technischen Anforderungen an Strassenfahrzeuge (VTS) in der Schweiz)|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19950165/index.html#a102|accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; installation in different vehicles. The accident data recorder constantly records various data of the vehicle (such as [[speed]], direction of travel, longitudinal and transverse vehicle acceleration, status of the lights, turn signals and braking, etc.) and records them for some time before they are automatically cleared.

In the case of an accident (this is detected by a strong [[acceleration]] of the vehicle as a result of an impulse), certain periods of time (usually in the two-digit seconds range) remain permanently stored before and after an event. This makes it much easier to reconstruct events after an accident, so that if necessary the question of [[Fault (legal)|fault]] can be clarified.

Many vehicles of authorities (such as [[police]] or [[ambulance]]) are equipped with it, as it often comes to disputes with collisions during driving with blues and twos about compliance with regulations. A side effect of vehicles equipped with UDS is that drivers behave more cautiously on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfalldatenspeicher (UDS) als möglicher Beitrag zur Verkehrssicherheit im Meinungsbild Jugendlicher und Heranwachsender (Seite 48)|periodical=d-nb.info|publisher=|url=http://d-nb.info/968495222/34#page=48|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-04-20|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Dirk-Antonio Harms|date=27 February 2003|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://motorzeitung.de/news.php?newsid=482247&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey by the EU Transport Commission, UDS users experienced a 20 to 30 percent decline in traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADAC warnt vor der Blackbox fürs Auto|periodical=|publisher=PS Welt|url=https://www.welt.de/motor/article108814877/ADAC-warnt-vor-der-Blackbox-fuers-Auto.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-22|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Robert Dunker|date=27 August 2012|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident data recorder is often used by [[Expert witness|experts]] or institutions in [[crash tests]] as a measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Alexander Wiek|Periodical=[[VKU Verkehrsunfall und Fahrzeugtechnik]]|Title=Die UDS-Plattform – Ein Hilfsmittel zur schnellen und einfachen Anwendbarkeit des UDS von VDO-Kienzle als Messgerät für den Sachverständigen|Volume=37|Issue=9|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;237–239|Date=1999|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UDS-AT.jpg|thumb|Accident data recorder UDS-AT (third generation)]]
[[File:Crash_Recorder_mit_Hand.jpg|thumb|Crash Recorder]]
The installation (also later) costs about 700 euros&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Datenspeicher verbessert Unfall-Rekonstruktion|periodical=|publisher=Handelsblatt|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/auto/nachrichten/gute-erfahrungen-mit-uds-datenspeicher-verbessert-unfall-rekonstruktion/2420704.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-10-01|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2004-10-20|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can lead to a deduction for some [[insurance policies]]. The accident data recorder can be read by an expert via interface cable. The accident data recorder (older generations) has a switch with which the driver can delete the stored data immediately after an accident so as not to burden himself with the later question of guilt. However, this feature may be disabled, for example for use in company vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfalldatenspeicher (UDS) als möglicher Beitrag zur Verkehrssicherheit im Meinungsbild Jugendlicher und Heranwachsender (Abschnitt 3.9 UDS bei WKD Security, Seite 51)|periodical=d-nb.info|publisher=|url=http://d-nb.info/968495222/34#page=51|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-04-20|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Dirk-Antonio Harms|date=27 February 2003|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Accident data recorders work to measure the accelerations, depending on the equipment in two or three spatial directions, with [[Accelerometer|micromechanical sensors]]. Often several sensor systems with different resolutions are used in order to be able to log the driving dynamic processes on the one hand and the collision dynamics themselves on the other. Higher-class systems also offer a possibility for measuring the rotational movements as well as the vehicle speed. The latter can e.g. be calculated from the signal of the vehicle's [[wheel speed sensor]]. The recording of any signals that are available on the vehicle's own [[CAN bus]], is possible with higher-class devices as well as the detection of a [[GPS]] signal for position and speed determination. Depending on the manufacturer, about 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;s are recorded before and 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;s after an event.

Are known today (as of 2018) in the German-speaking countries essentially two suitable for retrofitting accident data recorder. Blacktrack Ltd. offers a low-cost solution, which is mainly used by the insurance industry (e.g. [[AXA]] Winterthur in Switzerland). By contrast, the UDS-AT developed by the company consortium Peter Systemtechnik GmbH and Kast GmbH offers extended possibilities of recording and integration into a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colliseum.net/wiki/UDS-AT&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual path recording devices (RAG) from Mobatime AG are external devices that rely on existing on-board signals (distance, speed, operating states of status inputs) and store them in a ring buffer for at least the last 12 km.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mobatime.ch/de/fahrzeuggerate/datenaufzeichnungsgeraete/restwegaufzeichnung/rag-2000&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to an accident data recorder, they do not have their own measuring sensors.

== Evaluation ==
[[File:UDS-AT_Rohdaten_Real-Beispiel.jpg|thumb|Measurement data of a real accident from an accident data recorder]]
Reading out the data of an accident data recorder requires special software.

The evaluation and interpretation of measurement data of a traffic accident require special knowledge in the areas of [[vehicle dynamics]], [[accident reconstruction]], [[metrology]] and last but not least the accident data storage technology itself. For UDS there is a separate order area for expert witnesses in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://svv.ihk.de/svv/content/home/home.ihk&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture on the right shows the (unprocessed) data curves of a real accident recorded with a UDS. The measured accelerations, the speed and various status channels are plotted over time. It can be seen, for example, that vehicle special signals were switched on prior to the collision and the driver was previously still applying the brake.

== History ==
The nowadays known accident data recorder was invented by [[Kienzle Computer|Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH]], which applied for a patent in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=EP |number=0635153 |title=ACCIDENT DATA MEMORY |pubdate= August 18, 1994 |fdate=January 21, 1994 |pridate=February 6, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE |number=4218397 |title=Device for recording a short distance of motor vehicles |pubdate=December 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development began in Germany in the early 1980s with the two companies [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] and Kienzle, who pursued different concepts. In general, the black box was taken as a model, which was developed in the early 1950s in Australia by [[David Warren (inventor)|David Warren]]. Already in 1973, General Motors applied for a patent for a "vehicle crash recorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DE2322299 - Aufprallschreiber bei Fahrzeugen|periodical=[[European Patent Organisation|register.epo.org]]|publisher=|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=DE&amp;NR=2322299A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=1&amp;date=19731108&amp;DB=&amp;locale=#|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-21|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mannesmann Kienzle delivered the first accident data recorder in early 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Unfalldatenschreiber sorgt für Klarheit im Rechtsstreit Der "Polizist im Auto" verringert auch die Kosten bei der Rekonstruktion des Unfallhergangs.|periodical=|publisher=F.A.Z.

== Motorsport ==
In [[motorsport]], accident data recorders (ADR) must be used in various series as specified by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. Starting with the 2015 season, the use of an ADR in the [[Formula 4]] championship was compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalinstitute.org/2016/02/29/accident-data-recorders/&lt;/ref&gt; In the higher series, the use has been mandatory for some time. In addition to the data of the acceleration sensors mounted on the vehicle, the loads on the driver are also measured with an in-ear accelerometer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fiafoundation.org/blog/2016/june/safety-measures&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the higher speeds in formula sports compared to road traffic, the sensors have a measuring range of ± 150&amp;nbsp;g with a resolution of 0.1&amp;nbsp;g. 2&amp;nbsp;s are recorded before an event. With an event duration of 30&amp;nbsp;s, 10 events can be stored.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motec.com.au/adr/adrfeatures/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demarcation ==
Both in a [[flight recorder]] and in a UDS, the constantly recorded data runs in a [[ring buffer]]. However, the flight recorder usually records for longer periods of 17 to 25 hours. In contrast, the UDS only saves a few seconds before and after an event is triggered (e.g. collision) permanently.

The term ''drive data recorder'' is generally understood to mean a continuous and permanently available recording of data and signals during the operation of a vehicle, independently of an accident. Such systems are often used in locomotives or trams. Often, however, an [[electronic logbook]] is referred to as drive data recorder. [[Dashcam]]s are sometimes referred to as drive data recorder or ''video event data recorder'' (VEDR).

{{Main|Event Data Recorder}}
A so-called ''Event Data Recorder'' (EDR) is not an accident data recorder in the sense of an autonomous, more or less vehicle-independent device, since an EDR is usually an additional electronic module in an existing [[Engine control unit|control device]] (e.g. from the [[Airbag]]) in a car. EDRs rely exclusively on on-board signals, while UDS have their own inertial sensors. Vehicles with airbag systems store accident-relevant data (impact accelerations, belt buckle conditions, seat positions, trip times) in the internal memory of the tripping electronics. However, the data size varies depending on the manufacturer and only extends over a few seconds or fractions. [[NHTSA]] regulations call for uniform data sets for all systems manufactured from 2010 onwards.

'''Adrian Legg''' is an English guitar player who has been called "impossible to categorize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guitar |last=Chapman |first=Richard |authorlink= |author2= |year=2005 |publisher=DK Publishing |location= |isbn=0-7566-0945-3 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_olAAAACAAJ |quote=Impossible to categorize as a player, Adrian Legg incorporates virtually every genre on his guitar in a virtuosic instrumental style with effects. He brought electric approaches to acoustic playing, creating a modern cross-over amalgamation in the tradition of eclectic folk playing that goes back to the 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He plays custom guitars that are a hybrid of electric and [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]], and his [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerstyle]] picking technique has been acknowledged by the readers of ''[[Guitar Player]]'' who voted Legg the "best acoustic fingerstyle" player four years in a row (1993–1996).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010125080900/http://adrianlegg.com/reviews.htm Interview with Chris Fetters] for [http://www.whatsup-magazine.com/ What's Up!] magazine, Walla Walla Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his early start as a bench technician customising electric guitars, Legg moved into guitar instruction, publishing books and videos on guitar technique. In 1996 and 1997, Legg shared the stage with acclaimed guitar experts [[Joe Satriani]], [[Eric Johnson]] and [[Steve Vai]] as part of the [[G3 (tour)|G3 tour]]. Vai called Legg "Uncle Adrian"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019073531/http://www.adrianlegg.com/Archives/SleeveNotes/GB.htm Adrian Legg. Archives. Sleeve Notes. ''Guitar Bones – Adrian Legg''.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Satriani said of Legg's musicianship "He's simply the best acoustic guitar player I've ever heard. I don't know anyone else who can create such a cascade of beautiful notes... Adrian plays like he's got hammers for fingers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010125081300/http://adrianlegg.com/quotes.htm Guitar magazine, October 1997.

==Early career==
[[File:Adrian legg.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Legg at the Hare and Hounds pub in North London, 27 March 1987]]
Legg was born 16 May 1948 in [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], east London. He studied the [[oboe]] as a child but in teenage years his interest shifted to the guitar.

In the early 1970s, Legg won both the composition and performance sections of a competition run by the now defunct Guitar magazine, published by Musical New Services of Denmark Street, which led to his being asked to contribute articles to the magazine.  From then on, his technical flair produced a stream of articles in UK music press in the 1970s and early 1980s, culminating in the Kaye and Ward book "Customising Your Electric Guitar", 1981. He spent from 1979 to 1981 as a technician at Rose Morris Ltd., who then handled Marshall amplification, [[Ovation Guitar]] and [[Takamine Guitars]], and designed original and well-reviewed passive circuits for the then relaunched Vox guitars. In 1990, he was involved in the prototyping and launch of the highly successful Trace Acoustic amplifiers, and continues to maintain technical relationships with the musical instrument industry.

From a 1983 promotional flyer (Technopickers) from Spindrift Records; Having demonstrated Ovation guitar for a number of years and with sessions with Tom Robinson, a tour with Richard Thompson and appearing on Radio One's in Concert programme all have helped established Adrian.

==Going global==
Legg's first US release, ''Guitars and Other Cathedrals'' in 1990, pleased guitar fans. Over the years, he's played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] and toured with Richard Thompson, David Lindley, Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson and as part of the G3 Tour featuring Satriani, Johnson and [[Favored Nations]] founder [[Steve Vai]].&lt;ref name=LeggPress/&gt; For G3, Legg served as an opening act in 1996 and a headlining act in 1997. An infrequent singer, Legg helped with vocal duties on the collaborative G3 performance of [[Red House (song)|''Red House'']] by [[Jimi Hendrix]].

He's also shared the wealth of his talent and experience with teaching DVDs, videos and books. In recent years, he has also been a commentator-at-large for National Public Radio's "All Things Considered", and even more recently, regular listeners have heard his guitar versions of the show's theme music.&lt;ref name=LeggPress&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000623213929/http://www.adrianlegg.com/press_page.htm Adrian Legg. ''Press Page''.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Adrian Legg in Spain 2006.jpg|thumb|Legg performing at the ''Auditorio Maestro Padilla'' in [[Almería, Spain]], 18 July 2006]]
Legg plays [[fingerstyle guitar]], mixing an [[alternating-bass]] style with [[harmonics]], banjo-peg retuning and single or double-string bending. Often he will play a piece entirely in [[arpeggios]] similar to a classical guitar style. He makes extensive use of altered tunings and [[capo]]s.

Legg has said that his true home is onstage. "Playing live is the whole point... Everyone makes a journey, an effort; we all come together – me, the audience, the people who run the venue – to share this wonderful, universal, human emotional interaction. This is where music lives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041011191729/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=4060 All About Jazz. News. ''Favored Nations Acoustic Delivers Adrian Legg’s “Inheritance”''. August 24, 2004.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant part of a performance by Legg is the wryly funny storytelling patter he uses between songs, some of these stories included on ''Adrian Legg Live'' (2017). His distinctive wit is also in written evidence everywhere from his liner notes to his tablature books.

Legg included the use of modeling technology and [[MIDI]] for fingerstyle guitar on his 2004 album ''Inheritance'', which features extensive use of [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar synthesisers]] and modeled guitar sounds. This stands in contrast to the more acoustic sound of ''Guitar Bones''.

In an interview with Frets, a Guitar Player publication, Adrian listed some of the signal processors and effects that he utilizes to shape his acoustic tone.  This included several notable effects boxes such as the [[Effectrode]] PC-2A compressor, a [[Wampler|Wampler Pedals]] Black '65 Overdrive, and an [[Effeectrode]] Helios fuzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/newbay/frets_201502/#/6|title=Frets - February 2015|website=www.nxtbook.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian is also endorsed by [[Neunaber Audio]] and is currently using a [[Neunaber Audio]] Immerse Reverberator for his reverb needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neunaber.net/pages/adrian-legg|title=Adrian Legg|website=Neunaber Audio|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander of Abonoteichus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀβωνοτειχίτης}} ''Alexandros ho Abonoteichites''), also called '''Alexander the Paphlagonian''' ({{circa|105|170}} CE), was a [[Greece|Greek]] mystic and [[oracle]], and the founder of the [[Glycon]] cult that briefly achieved wide popularity in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] world. The contemporary writer [[Lucian of Samosata|Lucian]] reports that he was an utter fraud – the god Glycon was supposedly constructed out of a glove puppet. The vivid narrative of his career given by Lucian might be taken as fictitious but for the corroboration of certain coins of the emperors [[Lucius Verus]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]], ''Doctrma Nummorum veterum'', ii. pp. 383, 384&lt;/ref&gt; and of a statue of Alexander, said by [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]] to have stood in the forum of [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexander the Paphlagonian|volume=1|page=567}} This cites:
*[[Lucian]], {{Polytonic|Άλεξάνδρος ἢ ψευδόμαντις}}
*Samuel Dill, ''Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius'' (1904)
*[[Ferdinand Gregorovius|F. Gregorovius]], ''The Emperor Hadrian'', trans. by M. E. Robinson (1898).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], ''Apology'', {{circa|26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is further evidence from inscriptions&lt;ref&gt;See Dessau, [https://archive.org/stream/inscriptioneslat21dessuoft#page/134/mode/2up ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'', nos 4079-80]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lucian describes him as having swindled many people and engaged, through his followers, in various forms of thuggery.&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander the False Prophet," translated with annotation by A. M. Harmon, Loeb Classical Library, 1936. [http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of Lucian's venom against Alexander is attributed to Alexander's hate of the [[Epicureans]]. Lucian admired the works of [[Epicurus]], a eulogy of which concludes the piece, and whether or not Alexander was the master of fraud and deceit as portrayed by Lucian, he may not have been too different from other oracles of the age, when a great deal of dishonest exploitation occurred in some shrines.&lt;ref name=nutall&gt;Nuttall Costa, Charles Desmond, ''Lucian: Selected Dialogues'', p. 129, Oxford University Press (2005), 0-199-25867-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Not much is known about the early life of Alexander. He apparently worked in travelling medicine shows around Greece and might have been a prophet of the goddess [[Soi (goddess)|Soi]] or a follower of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]. In Lucian, his partner in profession is given as one Cocconas of [[Byzantium]]. After a period of instruction in medicine by a doctor who also, according to Lucian, was an impostor, in about 150 CE he established an oracle of Aesculapius at his native town of [[Abonoteichus]] (''femin''.: Ἀβωνότειχος; later [[Ionopolis]]), on the [[Euxine]], where he gained riches and great prestige by professing to heal the sick and reveal the future.&lt;ref&gt;Masson, John, ''Lucretius, Epicurean and Poet'', pp. 339-340, John Murray (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CatholicEnc&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before 160 CE Alexander formed a cult around the worship of a new snake-god, Glycon, and headquartered it in Abonoteichus. Having circulated a prophecy that the son of [[Apollo]] was to be born again, he contrived that there should be found in the foundations of the temple to [[Aesculapius]], then in course of construction at Abonoteichus, an egg in which a small live [[snake]] had been placed. In an age of superstition no people had so great a reputation for credulity as the Paphlagonians, and Alexander had little difficulty in convincing them of the second coming of the god under the name of Glycon. A large tame snake with a false human head, wound round Alexander's body as he sat in a shrine in the temple,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurther, David, ''Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt and the Problem of the Category of Macician'', in Schäfer, Peter and Kippenberg, Hans Gerhard, ''Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium'', p. 115, BRILL (1997), {{ISBN|90-04-05432-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave "autophones", or oracles unasked.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The numerous questions asked of the oracle were answered by Alexander in metrical predictions. In his most prosperous year he is said to have delivered nearly 80,000 replies, concerning bodily, mental, and social afflictions, for each of which he received a [[drachma]] and two [[Obolus|oboli]].&lt;ref name=CatholicEnc /&gt;

Healing instructions were commonly combined with [[oracle]]s, but Alexander did more; he instituted [[mystery cult|mysteries]] like those of [[Eleusis]]. Through the cult Alexander achieved a certain level of political influence – his daughter married [[Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus]], the governor of the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. He found believers from [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] to [[Rome]] through pretended arts of soothsaying and magic and was revered and consulted as a prophet by many notable individuals of his age.&lt;ref&gt;Neander, Johann August W, ''General history of the Christian religion and Church'' (1850), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Antonine Plague|plague of 166]] a verse from the oracle was used as an [[amulet]] and was inscribed over the doors of houses as a protection and an oracle was sent, at [[Marcus Aurelius]]' request, by Alexander to the Roman army on the [[Danube]] [[Marcomannic Wars|during the war]] with the [[Marcomanni]], declaring that victory would follow on the throwing of two lions alive into the river. The result was a great disaster and Alexander had recourse to the old quibble of the [[Delphic oracle]] to [[Croesus]] for an explanation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His main opponents were [[Epicurean]]s and [[Early Christianity|Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergurson, Everett, ''Backgrounds of Early Christianity'', p. 218, (2003), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8028-2221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian's account of Alexander represents the Christians—along with the Epicureans—as the special enemies and as the principal objects of his hate: Epicureans had too little religion or superstition to give in to a religious pretender; and the Christian faith was too deep-rooted to dream of any communion with Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Rainy, Robert D. D., ''The Ancient Catholic Church: From the Accession of Trajan to the Fourth General Council, (A.D. 98-451)'', p. 32, Charles Scribner's Sons (1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucian's own close investigations into Alexander's methods of fraud led to a serious attempt on his life. The whole account gives a graphic description of the inner working of one among the many new oracles that were springing up at this period. Alexander had remarkable beauty and the striking personality of the successful charlatan, and must have been a man of considerable intellectual abilities and power of organization. His usual methods were those of the numerous oracle-mongers of the time, of which Lucian gives a detailed account: the opening of sealed inquiries by heated needles, a neat plan of forging broken seals, and the giving of vague or meaningless replies to difficult questions, coupled with a lucrative blackmailing of those whose inquiries were compromising.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Alexander died of [[gangrene]] of the leg in his seventieth year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Modern scholarship ==
Scholars have described Alexander as an oracle who perpetrated a hoax to deceive gullible citizens,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David, ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: A Critical Edition'', p. 175, Oxford University Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-19-825060-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Marmin W., ''The Ancient Mysteries: A Sourcebook'', p. 43, University of Pennsylvania Press (1999), {{ISBN|0-8122-1692-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a [[false prophet]] and charlatan who played on the hopes of simple people. He was said to have "made predictions, discovered fugitive slaves, detected thieves and robbers, caused treasures to be dug up, healed the sick, and in some cases actually raised the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander the False Prophet'', ch. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Stephen A. Kent]], in a study of the text, compares Lucian's Alexander to the "[[malignant narcissist]]" in modern psychiatric theory, and suggests that the "behaviors" described by Lucian "have parallels with several modern cult leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Kent. "Narcissistic Fraud in the Ancient World: Lucian's Account of Alexander of Abonoteichus and the Cult of Glycon," ''Ancient Narrative'' (University of Groningen), Vol. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Freckelton has noted at least a surface similarity between Alexander and [[David Berg]], the leader of a contemporary religious group, the [[Family International|Children of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Freckelton. "'Cults' Calamities and Psychological Consequences," ''Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'', 5(1), pp. 1-46. {{DOI|10.1080/13218719809524918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AmazinSpidermanObama.jpg|thumb|From ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 583 Variant (January 2009)&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Phil Jimenez]] &amp; [[Barry Kitson]].]]
[[Barack Obama]] has appeared as a character in comic books published by a number of publishing companies, sometimes appearing as a realistic fictionalized version of himself and sometimes as a spoof.

==Publication history==
Obama made his first appearance as a comic book character in July 2007 in ''Licensable BearTM'' No. 4 by [[Nat Gertler]], where he appeared as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]. The comic only had a print-run of 1,050 issues. A year later, in September 2008, Obama appeared in [[Erik Larsen]]’s ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' No. 137.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan V. |last=Last |title=It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's... Obama |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124719493132621465 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue featured a variant cover which showed Obama with the Savage Dragon, who proclaims that he is endorsing him for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=394436 |title=''Savage Dragon'' No. 137 |publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue sold out four print runs.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; A month later, the comic was followed up by ''Presidential Material: Barack Obama'' by [[Jeff Mariotte]] and in November 2008 with ''Obama: The Comic Book'' by Rod Espinosa.

In November 2008, two things led to an explosion in popularity of the Obama comic book character. One of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' titled, "Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know." In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects "[[Spider-Man]] and [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swaine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/3401168/Barack-Obama-The-50-facts-you-might-not-know.html |title=Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then later that month, on November 4, 2008, Obama became the first African-American to be elected President of the United States.

When [[Marvel Comics]] discovered the president-elect was an avid collector of [[Spider-Man]] comics, they decided to have Obama the comic book character be put on the cover of their ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 583 (January 2009), for the story "[[Spidey Meets the President!]]" written by [[Zeb Wells]]. This particular release proved extremely popular and sold out in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Lining Up for Obama and Spider-Man|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/hundreds-brave-chill-for-obama-comic/?hp|accessdate=7 November 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after the release, the edition was sold for $300 on [[eBay]]. Prior to the Spider-Man story, the president-elect was featured in Secret Invasion #8; this is the first appearance of president-elect Barack Obama in a Marvel comic.

Obama the comic book character has been put on the cover and pages of many other comics including ''Savage Dragon'' No. 145 (February 2008) by Erik Larsen and ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' No. 8 (February 2008) by [[Rob Liefeld]]. The ''Savage Dragon'' No. 145 had a special edition variant only offered at the WonderCon 2009 in San Francisco in March 2009 (only 1,500 were produced). On the cover, Barack Obama can be seen holding an American flag and punching Osama Bin Laden in the face.

Barack Obama is the subject of graphic novel "Barack Hussein Obama" by [[Steven Weissman]]. In this, President Obama and his cast of characters (Secretary Clinton, VP Joe Biden, his family) experience life in a parallel universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven Weissman |url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/barackhusseinobama |title=Barack Hussein Obama |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |isbn=978-1-60699-623-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barack Obama has also appeared in [[Archie Comics]] Veronica #199, and Archie #616 and #617.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comics.org/issue/418372/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicmix.com/news/2010/09/22/obama-and-palin-meet-archie-andrews/&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama was in the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] Storyline of DC comics of 2011. He discusses the earth members of The Green Lantern Corp with [[Amanda Waller]].

'''Bernhard, schavuit van Oranje''' ([[English language|English title]]: '''''Bernhard, scoundrel of Orange''''') is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television program depicting the more than only turbulent life of a [[prince consort]]. It is a compelling drama concerning a man who tries to be himself, but must survive deep crises, finally to see the real meaning of love. Within the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch royal family]] there is actually no more talked about character than [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld]]. Whether it concerns [[Greet Hofmans]], extramarital affairs, or Lockheed, Prince Bernhard faced a lot of scandals throughout the course of his life. Besides this he was, and is a person, loved by many as a war hero. A man of extremes. In four parts Prince Bernhard tells the tale of his life. Not only through the spyglass, but especially to his grandson's wife, [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands]], who will be soon the Queen next to [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince Willem-Alexander]]. In a way, she takes the same position as Prince Bernhard did in his life. In their conversations and discussions it becomes clear how much they are different, but also how much they are the same. For [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands|Princess Máxima]] this is sometimes very confronting. The tale drags us throughout the course of the Prince's life, from [[Soestdijk]], his beloved German Reckenwalde, Berlin, London, [[Argentina]] and Canada.

'''''Bingo Crosbyana''''' is a 1936 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon short directed by [[Friz Freleng]], and notable for its title song, composed by Sanford Green and with lyrics by [[Irving Kahal]].

==Plot==
The plot revolves around a group of fun-loving [[anthropomorphic]] [[insects]] which have taken over a kitchen. The female insects promptly become enthralled by a [[crooning]] show-off of a fly, Bingo Crosbyana, "the crooning hit of all [[Havana]]", a caricature of the singer [[Bing Crosby]], who incurs the jealous resentment of their boyfriends. Bingo, however, literally shows his colors (yellow) when a [[spider]] invades the kitchen, leaving Bingo to cower in fear inside a roll of wax paper. After the boyfriends team up to trap the spider on a sheet of fly paper, Bingo emerges from the wax paper roll and attempts to resume his braggadocio, only to be put in his place decisively.

==Legal cases==
''Bingo Crosbyana'' was one of two [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons (along with ''[[Let It Be Me (cartoon)|Let It Be Me]]'') which Bing Crosby initiated lawsuits to suppress because they portrayed him in what Crosby considered a defamatory light. In this case, he objected to his portrayal as a vainglorious coward and to the imitation of his voice.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Hollywood Reporter]], [[Paramount Pictures]] was suing Warner Bros. alongside Crosby. Their law firm wanted the distribution of the film to cease. Apparently they lost their case.

'''Sir Robert John Parker''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM}} (born 13 January 1953) is a former New Zealand broadcaster and politician. He served as [[Mayor of Christchurch]] from 2007 to 2013.

==Early years==
Parker grew up in the [[Christchurch]] suburbs of [[Heathcote Valley]] and [[Somerfield, New Zealand|Somerfield]]. He attended [[Christchurch South Intermediate]] and [[Cashmere High School]]. He studied an intermediate year in [[zoology]] at the [[University of Canterbury]] before undertaking casual work.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/mayor/biography.aspx |title=Mayor Bob Parker – biography |publisher=Christchurch City Council |accessdate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222045858/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/mayor/biography.aspx |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting career==
Parker got his first job on radio, in Nelson. His broadcasting career then took him to Christchurch, Wellington and then Auckland.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He was the associate producer and original host (1984–1996) of the New Zealand version of the ''[[This Is Your Life (New Zealand TV series)|This is Your Life]]'' series after he purchased the New Zealand television rights for the show from Ralph Edwards Productions in California. He returned to Christchurch in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nztourismconference.co.nz/Programme---Highlights/Speakers-Biographies.asp |title=Speakers Biographies – Bob Parker |date=1 August 2008 |publisher=Tourism Industry Conference New Zealand |accessdate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105015652/http://www.nztourismconference.co.nz/Programme---Highlights/Speakers-Biographies.asp |archivedate=5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local body politics==
Parker's local government career spanned more than two decades. He first became politically active when he filled a councillor vacancy on the [[Banks Peninsula District]] Council in 1994.&lt;ref name="Press bio"&gt;{{cite news |title=Twenty years serving the community |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=19 June 2013 |page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Television star new mayor of Banks Peninsula|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=222678|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|agency=[[The Star (Christchurch)|The Star]]|date=13 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having lived in [[Akaroa]] for several years, he served as mayor of [[Banks Peninsula]] District for two terms (2001–2006). He favoured amalgamation of the district with Christchurch City and led a high profile and controversial campaign leading to a poll in 2005. Amalgamation with the City was supported by 65% of the Peninsula's voters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobparker.co.nz/index.html |title=bobparker.co.nz |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803041710/http://www.bobparker.co.nz/index.html |archivedate=3 August 2004 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amalgamation took place on 3 March 2006, at which Parker, after winning a by-election, became a Christchurch city councillor, and the sole Banks Peninsula representative on the council.&lt;ref name="Press bio"/&gt;

In 2006 Parker was elected as the independent chair of the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy. This saw the bringing together of four local councils—Christchurch, Selwyn, Waimakariri and the Canterbury Regional Council—for a major planning undertaking based on creating a sustainable growth plan for the greater Christchurch area. The Strategy was adopted in 2007 by all of the member councils and is today the basis for all spatial planning in the greater Christchurch area.

In October 2007, Parker successfully stood in the [[New Zealand local elections, 2007|local government elections]] for the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2007|Christchurch mayoralty]], after the retirement of [[Garry Moore (mayor)|Garry Moore]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10469695"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10469695 |title=New faces aplenty in local government shake-ups |author=Gay, Edward |date=13 October 2007 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received 47,033 votes, with [[Megan Woods]] (32,821) and [[Jo Giles]] (14,454) in the election contested by ten candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christchurch City Mayor |url=http://www.elections2010.co.nz/2007/elections/christchurch-city-mayor |publisher=Local Elections 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827073353/http://www.elections2010.co.nz/2007/elections/christchurch-city-mayor# |archive-date=27 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker announced in 2009 that he would seek re-election at the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2010|2010 Christchurch mayoral election]].&lt;ref name="Gordon candidacy"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/3597603/Gordon-announces-mayoral-candidacy |title=Gordon to enter race |last=Conway |first=Glenn |date=20 April 2010 |publisher=The Press |page=A2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |location=Christchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being the incumbent, he initially polled behind his major challenger&lt;ref name="UMR June opinion poll"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mayoralty SurveyChristchurch City Council |url=http://www.umr.co.nz/Media/Christchurch_MayoralElectionResearch_Jun10.pdf |publisher=UMR Research |accessdate=20 July 2010 |location=Wellington |format=PDF |date=June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195105/http://www.umr.co.nz/Media/Christchurch_MayoralElectionResearch_Jun10.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="umr_1"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1006/S00145.htm |title=Anderton Leading Parker In Race|publisher=UMR Research Ltd |date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4070928"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/4070928/ |title=Anderton leads in mayoral race |author=Conway, Glenn |date=28 August 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the large [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/3366146g.html Christchurch 7.1magnitude – 4.35am Sat 4th Sept 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905223314/http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/3366146g.html |date=5 September 2010 }}, Geonet, Christchurch Earthquake Reference&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 September 2010.

===2010 earthquake===
[[File:Band Together Concert For Canterbury.jpg|thumb|Parker performing with [[The Bats (New Zealand band)|The Bats]] at the Band Together Concert For Canterbury in October 2010]]
Parker was the incumbent mayor at the time of the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|September 2010 Canterbury earthquake]]. During the days following the quake, he worked with [[Civil Defence]], the police and the New Zealand Army to get the city back up and running. In October 2010, Christchurch band [[The Bats (New Zealand band)|The Bats]] and many others played at a free earthquake relief concert in [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]] in front of about 140,000 people. Parker joined The Bats for the performance and played guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rocking for right reasons |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4269120/Rocking-for-right-reasons |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bob and The Bats on show |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4217870/Bob-and-The-Bats-on-show |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the earthquake, some polls had Parker trailing Anderton but his high profile since 4 September and cool handling of the earthquake's aftermath won him widespread praise and the support of voters who overwhelmingly backed him to run the city for a second term.&lt;ref name="Parker re-elected"&gt;{{cite news |last=Conway |first=Glenn |title=Bob Parker re-elected Christchurch Mayor |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/local-elections-2010/4215351/Bob-Parker-re-elected-Christchurch-Mayor |accessdate=22 December 2011 |newspaper=stuff.co.nz |date=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 earthquake===
[[File:Mayor bob Parker speaks to ships' companies in Lyttelton.jpg|thumb|Mayor Parker speaks to ships' companies in the port town [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]]]]
Parker was the media face of the recovery efforts in the aftermath of the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], working with the police and the army and rescue squads, as well as answering the media's questions.

On 18 March 2011, Parker addressed the national Christchurch memorial service at [[Hagley Park (New Zealand)|Hagley Park]] of Christchurch in the presence of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], Prime Minister [[John Key]], Dame [[Malvina Major]], [[Hayley Westenra]], [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]] Choir, dignitaries, international rescue teams and tens of thousands of [[New Zealanders]].&lt;ref name="TVNZ_4071980"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-quake-memorial-service-happened-4071417/video?vid=4071980 |title=Christchurch quake memorial service: As it happened |date=18 March 2011 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the February earthquake the New Zealand Government brought in a special act of Parliament, [[The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act]], which essentially passed ultimate responsibility for the [[rebuilding of post-quake Christchurch]] to the Government. The Council was given the task of preparing a new plan to rebuild the central business district of the city. The project, chaired by Parker, was titled "share an idea". It won international acclaim for the Council, including the international "Co Creation" award - the first time this award had been granted outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stoppress.co.nz/blog/2011/11/strategys-share-an-idea-gets-international-co-creation-plaudits | title=Strategy's Share an Idea gets international co-creation plaudits | work=StopPress | date=28 November 2011 | accessdate=17 September 2014 | author=StopPress Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outrage was expressed at the Council, after Christchurch City Council CEO [[Tony Marryatt]] was given a near $70,000 pay rise in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christchurch protest over city chief's pay rise |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-protest-over-city-chief-s-pay-rise-4666796 |accessdate=22 December 2011 |newspaper=TVNZ |date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest was held at the City Council Building on 1 February 2012. Approximately 4000 citizens turned up to protest the decision of the City Council, and to call for a mid-term election.&lt;ref name="CCC protest"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachdeva |first=Sam |title=Protesters threaten rates revolt in Christchurch |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6351630/Protesters-threaten-rates-revolt-in-Christchurch |accessdate=4 February 2012 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 when the government announced the cost of the rebuild was going to be as much as $40 billion, Parker said it was "no surprise", and welcomed the extra investment as being "good for [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Dan |last = Satherley | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Rebuild-cost-jump-no-surprise---Parker/tabid/423/articleID/295852/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News NZ]] |title= Rebuild cost jump 'no surprise' - Parker| date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bob's Mob cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Residential protest against Parker and CEO [[Tony Marryatt]]]]
In mid-June 2013, Minister for Earthquake Recovery [[Gerry Brownlee]] revealed in a press conference that [[International Accreditation New Zealand]] (IANZ) had written to [[Christchurch City Council]] threatening to revoke its accreditation for issuing building consents. This caught Parker by surprise, as he knew nothing of this threat, and he criticised Brownlee for not communicating with him before the press conference; Parker famously labelled Brownlee's practice a "media missile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultimatum in consent crisis looms |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8794459/Ultimatum-in-consent-crisis-looms |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Council's 'arranged marriage' on the rocks |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/8794426/Councils-arranged-marriage-on-the-rocks |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] | date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownlee and Parker had at times a strained relationship, with the government taking an increasing amount of control in local decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Race to decide who's the boss |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8828396/Race-to-decide-whos-the-boss |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Parker announced on ''[[Campbell Live]]'' he would not be running for re-election in the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|2013 Christchurch mayoral elections]], citing exhaustion and not having the required energy for a third term as mayor. He stated that although staff had assured him they would satisfy the requirements of the consenting process the accreditation had been withdrawn;&lt;ref name="accreditation lost"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Callaghan |first1=Jody |last2=Young |first2=Rachel |last3=Cairns |first3=Lois |title=Govt to move on consent debacle &lt;!-- note that the printed version is somewhat different from the online version; the heading is from the printed version --&gt;|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8865188/Consents-Marryatt-must-front |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=2 July 2013 |location=Christchurch |pages=A1-A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Christchurch City Council CEO takes leave |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8873496/Christchurch-City-Council-CEO-takes-leave |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[Fairfax New Zealand]] |date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this had happened on "his watch" as Mayor he felt he should take responsibility for the loss.&lt;ref name=quits&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Callaghan |first=Jody |title=Embattled Mayor Parker quits&lt;!-- The online version of this article has the additional word "Embattled" in the title --&gt; |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/8885574/Embattled-Mayor-Parker-quits |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705203953/http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/8885574/Embattled-Mayor-Parker-quits |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=6 July 2013 |page=A1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conway |first=Glenn |title='This happened on my watch' - Parker |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/8887205/This-happened-on-my-watch-Parker |accessdate=6 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 an editorial in ''[[The Press]]'' noted that a tribute paid to Parker by the Prime Minister of New Zealand [[John Key]] was "well deserved".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/8966098/Editorial-Parker-tribute-well-deserved&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister in a speech to the [[Local Government New Zealand]] organisation in 2013 stated that Parker's "commitment to the city during its darkest hours will be his legacy".&lt;ref name="LGNZ"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.national.org.nz/news/news/media-releases/detail/2013/07/22/address-to-2013-local-government-new-zealand-conference | title=Address to 2013 Local Government New Zealand Conference | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=17 September 2014 | author=Rt Hon John Key|publisher=[[New Zealand National Party]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2014 New Year Honours]], Parker was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to local-body affairs and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2014 | title=New Year honours list 2014|date=31 December 2013 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''The Press'' stated that Parker had "fronted the media coverage of the two disasters and the ensuing civil emergencies to local and international media. His calm leadership throughout the emergency periods were noted for providing reassurance and hope to the people of Christchurch."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/9564989/Editorial-Controversial-but-deserved&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[manga]], [[Cesare Borgia|Cesare]]'s father [[Rodrigo Borgia]], a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], sells his infant son's soul to the [[Devil]] as part of a deal that will one day make him [[Pope]] (Rodrigo will become Pope with the name of [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]]).  Cesare is consequently shunned by his father, who is unable to see him as anything but an agent of darkness and reminder of his [[sin]].  Increasingly alienated, Cesare eventually comes to rely on the dark powers within himself.  He becomes obsessed with  the idea of conquest, and is aided in his political machinations by the [[assassination|assassin]] Don Michelotto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3049">'''Christian Rath''' (October 22, 1831-February 14, 1920) was a German-American soldier and businessman. Among his duties as an officer in the U.S. Army was to act as the executioner for several of the conspirators in the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="BoothieBarn"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ramirez Taylor |first1=Kate |title=Grave Thursday: Captain Christian Rath |url=https://boothiebarn.com/2017/01/05/grave-thursday-captain-christian-rath/ |website=BoothieBarn |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rath was born to Johann Adam and Anna Marie (Schlee) Rath in [[Pfalzgrafenweiler]], [[Landkreis Freudenstadt]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], in modern [[Germany]]. At the age of 18, he left home to participate in the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|revolutionary movement]] sweeping the region at that time.&lt;ref name="Find A Grave"&gt;{{cite web |title=Capt Christian Rath |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21138367/christian-rath |website=Find A Grave |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 19, he emigrated to the United States. He served in the [[United States Navy]] for a brief time, and then settled in [[Jackson, Michigan]].

==U.S. Army service==
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Rath enlisted in the [[17th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref name="MLive"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Leanne |title=Jackson resident played key role in execution of people convicted in plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln; his role was excluded from "The Conspirator" |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2011/04/jackson_resident_played_key_ro.html |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=MLive |date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution of Lincoln conspirators===
[[File:Execution Lincoln assassins.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Execution of (''left to right'') Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C.]]
While detailed to the staff of Major General [[John F. Hartranft]], Rath was assigned various duties related to the executions by [[hanging]] of [[Mary Surratt]], [[Lewis Paine]], [[David Herold]], and [[George Atzerodt]] on July 7, 1865, due their guilty verdicts stemming from the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. These duties included making and hanging the nooses, giving the command for the prisoners to be hung, and arranging for their bodies to be put into coffins and buried.

==Later life==
Rath was discharged from the Union Army on July 19, 1865, twelve days after his participation in the execution, and returned to his home in Jackson, Michigan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">'''Computer.com''' was a short-lived [[dot-com company]] founded in 1999. After spending half of its $7 million in venture capital on [[Dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV|ads during Super Bowl XXXIV]], it was sold to [[Office Depot]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="WeekAm"&gt;Shroeder, Charlie.

Accessed February 26 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is significant as a [[case study]] for business historians and others interested in the [[dot-com bubble]].

==History==
Prior to 1999, the domain computer.com was owned by [[Gary Kremen]], who sold it for $500,000.&lt;ref name="webarchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990801000000*/http://computer.com |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexdotcom.com/story/people/kremen |title=Gary Kremen &amp;#124; The Brutal Battle for Sex.com |website=Sexdotcom.com |date=1963-09-20 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Mike Ford and [[Mike %22Zappy%22 Zapolin]] founded Computer.com as a general-purpose website to teach people about various aspects of computing.&lt;ref name="WeekAm"/&gt; After raising $7 million in [[venture capital]],&lt;ref name="Note2" group="note"&gt;CNet.com gives the company's initial capital as $5.8 million.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer.com partnered with an advertising agency to create three Super Bowl advertisements six weeks before the game started.&lt;ref name="WeekAm"/&gt; Initially, they were dismayed, as due to their late entry, their time slot was located at the end of the game, at the two-minute warning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13755">The '''Cornish language revival''' ({{lang-kw|dasserghyans Kernowek|lit='resurrection of Cornish'}}) is an ongoing process to revive the use of the [[Cornish language]] of [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom. The Cornish language's disappearance began to hasten during the 13th century, but its decline began with the Anglo-Saxon invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Last speaker of the Cornish language|The last reported person]] to have full knowledge of a traditional form of Cornish, John Davey, died in 1891. The revival movement started in the late 19th century as a result of [[antiquarian]] and academic interest in the language, which was already [[Language extinction|extinct]], and also as a result of the [[Celtic revival]] movement. In 2009, UNESCO changed its classification of Cornish from "extinct" to "critically endangered", seen as a milestone for the revival of the language.

==Revival==
{{refimprove-section|date=January 2016|small=yes}}
[[File:DSCN1082JennerPlaque.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque on Henry Jenner's home with bilingual inscription]]
During the 19th century the Cornish language was the subject of antiquarian interest and a number of lectures were given on the subject and pamphlets on it were published. In 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist [[Henry Jenner]] published ''A Handbook of the Cornish Language''. The publication of this book is often considered to be the start of the current revival movement. The spelling in this book was based on that used when Cornish was last a community language in the 18th century.

===Unified Cornish===
{{Main|Unified Cornish}}
The first project to codify Cornish spelling and provide a regular orthography for the revived language was that of [[Robert Morton Nance]] who outlined his work in ''Cornish for All'' in 1929. Unlike the Late Cornish-based work of Jenner, Nance's orthography, called [[Unified Cornish]], was based mainly on the Middle Cornish of the 14th and 15th centuries. Nance believed that this period represented a high point for Cornish literature. As well as presenting a standardised spelling system, Nance also extended the attested vocabulary with forms based largely on [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and published a dictionary of Unified Cornish in 1938. Nance's purist approach favoured older 'Celtic' forms rather than the historically more recent forms deriving from Middle and Early Modern English.

Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish and his orthography was the only one in use for most of the 20th century. However, as the focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language seemed less suitable for a spoken revival. Also, Nance's phonology lacked some distinctions which later research showed must have existed in traditional Cornish. Unified Cornish is still in use by some speakers who, while acknowledging its shortcomings, feel it has served well for the first decades of the revival.

===Kernewek Kemmyn===
{{Main|Kernewek Kemmyn}}
In 1986, in response to dissatisfaction with Unified Cornish, [[Ken George]] undertook a study of the sounds of Cornish and devised a new orthography, ''Kernewek Kemmyn'' or ''Common Cornish'', based on his research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ferdinand, Siarl (2-December-2013). "A Brief History of the Cornish Language, its Revival and its Current Status" (PDF). e-Keltoi 2: 199-227. Retrieved 18 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Like Unified Cornish, Kernewek Kemmyn retained a Middle Cornish base but implemented an orthography that aspired to be as [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] as possible. George argued that this much closer relationship between sounds and writing would make Cornish much easier to teach and learn.

In 1987, after one year of discussion, the [[Cornish Language Board]] agreed to adopt it. Its adoption by the Cornish Language Board caused a division in the Cornish language community, especially since people had been using Nance's old system for many years and were unfamiliar with the new one. While it was adopted by a majority of Cornish speakers (various estimates put it at around 55–80%), it came under fierce criticism by academic linguists for its phonological base, as well as those who found its novel orthography too different from traditional Cornish spelling conventions.

===Unified Cornish Revised===
In 1995, ''Kernewek Kemmyn'' was itself challenged by [[Nicholas Williams]] who in his book ''Cornish Today'' listed 26 major flaws in ''Kernewek Kemmyn''. As an alternative, Williams devised and proposed a revision of Unified Cornish, called Unified Cornish Revised (or UCR). UCR built on Unified Cornish, making the spellings regular while keeping as close as possible to the orthographic practices of the medieval scribes. In common with Kernewek Kemmyn, UCR made use of Tudor and Late Cornish prose materials unavailable to Nance. A comprehensive English-Cornish dictionary of Unified Cornish Revised was published in 2000 and sold enough copies to merit a second edition. A response to the criticisms in ''Cornish Today'' appeared soon after in ''Kernewek Kemmyn – Cornish for the Twenty First Century'' by Ken George and Paul Dunbar. A counter-reply to the latter appeared in 2007.

===Modern Cornish===
{{Main|Modern Cornish}}
In the early 1980s, [[Richard Gendall]], who had worked with Nance, published a new system based on the works of the later Cornish writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, just before to the language died out. This variety, called [[Modern Cornish]], also known as Late Cornish, uses later, somewhat simpler grammatical constructions and a vocabulary and spelling that was more influenced by English. The orthography has undergone a number of changes. The main body promoting Modern Cornish is [[Cussel an Tavas Kernuak]].

===Cornish Language Partnership===
{{Main|Cornish Language Partnership}}
In practice these different written forms did not prevent Cornish speakers from communicating with each other effectively. However, the existence of multiple orthographies was unsustainable with regards to using the language in education and public life, as no single orthography had ever achieved a wide consensus. Following the recognition in 2002 of Cornish under Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and the subsequent establishment of the [[Cornish Language Partnership]], the need for consensus became more urgent. In response to this, the Partnership initiated a process to agree on a standard form for use in education and public life.

In 2007 an independent Cornish Language Commission consisting of sociolinguists and linguists from outside of Cornwall was formed to review the four existing forms (Unified, UCR, Late Cornish and Kemmyn) and consider whether any of these existing orthographies might be suitable for adoption as a standard form of Cornish, or whether a new fifth form should be adopted. Two groups made proposals of compromise orthographies:
* The ''UdnFormScrefys'' (''Single Written Form'') Group developed and proposed an orthography, [[Kernowak Standard]], based on traditional orthographic forms and having a clear relation between spelling and pronunciation, taking both Middle Cornish and Late Cornish dialects of Revived Cornish into account.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.kernowek.net Kernowek Standard website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of the Standard Written Form, Kernowak Standard has evolved to become a set of proposed amendments to the SWF.
* Two members of the CLP's Linguistic Working Group, Albert Bock and Benjamin Bruch, proposed another orthography called ''Kernowek Dasunys'' (Cornish Re-unified) which endeavoured to reconcile UC, KK, RLC, and UCR orthographies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dasunys.net/ Kernowek Dasunys website]&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was used as a source of input for the SWF but is not being used as a separate orthography.
* Members of a group called ''Kaskyrgh Kernewek Kemmyn'' (Campaign for Kernewek Kemmyn) did not agree with the creation of a new standard, and argued that the existing Kernewek Kemmyn orthography should become the standard.

The SWF process eventually decided that the existing orthographies were too contentious to be considered and that a new compromise orthography that all groups could support was needed.

===Standard Written Form===
{{Main|Standard Written Form}}
On 9 May 2008, the Cornish Language Partnership met with the specification for the Standard Written Form as the main item on the agenda. All four Cornish language groups, Unified Cornish, Unified Cornish Revised, Kernewek Kemmyn and Modern Cornish were represented at this meeting. Reactions to the proposed orthography were mixed from the various language groups, Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek, Cussel an Tavaz Kernûak, Kesva an Taves Kernewek and Agan Tavas, but the majority wanted resolution and acceptance. The Cornish Language Partnership said that it would 'create an opportunity to break down barriers and the agreement marked a significant stepping stone in the Cornish language'.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The vote to ratify the SWF was carried and on 19 May 2008 it was announced that the orthography had been agreed on. Eric Brooke, chairman of the Cornish Language Partnership, said: ''"This marks a significant stepping-stone in the development of the Cornish language. In time this step will allow the Cornish language to move forward to become part of the lives of all in Cornwall."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7074487.stm BBC News 19 May 2008 – Breakthrough for Cornish language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7408686.stm BBC News 19 May 2008 – Standard Cornish spelling agreed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=41352 Cornish Language Partnership – Standard Written Form Ratified]&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and final Standard Written Form draft was generated on 30 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/ Kernowek official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2009, the bards of the [[Gorseth Kernow]], under the leadership of [[Grand Bard]] Vanessa Beeman adopted, by overwhelming majority and after two decades of debate, to adopt the SWF for their ceremonies and correspondence. From the earliest days under Grand Bards [[Henry Jenner]] and Morton Nance, Unified Cornish had been used for the Gorseth ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/language-progress/article-1084119-detail/article.html "This is Cornwall" website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kernowek Standard===
{{Main|Kernowek Standard}}
''Kernowek Standard'' (Standard Cornish) is a proposed set of revisions to the SWF. It is based on the initial proposal (called ''Kernowak Standard'' and now designated KS1) for the SWF, developed by a group called UdnFormScrefys. After the publication of the SWF specification, members of this group established a new group, Spellyans, to identify shortcomings in the SWF and propose solutions for consideration when the SWF is reviewed in 2013. The orthography resulting from the application of these revisions, Kernowek Standard, has been used in a number of books, including an edition of the Bible and a comprehensive grammar, ''Desky Kernowek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Williams, Nicholas|title=Desky Kernowek: A complete guide to Cornish|publisher=Evertype|year=2012}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904808-99-2}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|978-1-904808-95-4}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cumero Fire''' was a [[wildfire]] burning southeast of [[Sasabe, Arizona]], on the US-Mexico border in the [[Coronado National Forest]] in [[Arizona]] in the United States. The fire was reported on July 5 and burned {{Convert|3925|acre|km2|0}}. As of July 8, the fire was 80 percent contained. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

==Events==

Smoke from the Cumero Fire was first spotted on July 5 southeast of [[Sasabe, Arizona]], along the US-Mexico border. The fire was burning in grass south of Cumero Mountain, with the majority of the fire on US land. Fire crews immediately focused on fire suppression. The fire threatened Garcia Ranch and cell phone communication towers. That evening, temporary flight restrictions were put in place. Coronado National Forest was put under evacuation warnings.&lt;ref name="IW75"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumero Fire Update July 5 - InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5894/43697/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 6, the fire had reached {{Convert|3825|acre|km2|0}} and was 40 percent contained. Of that acreage,{{Convert|3625|acre|km2|0}} was on US land. The majority of fire activity remained on the mountain, with fire suppression and containment being the focus.&lt;ref name="IW76"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumero Fire Update July 6  - InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5894/43728/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, July 7, the fire had expanded into [[Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name="IW77"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumero Fire Updated July 7 - InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5894/43768/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 8, the Cumero Fire had burned {{Convert|3925|acre|km2|0}} and was 80 percent contained.&lt;ref name="InciWeb"/&gt; 

==Impacts==

The Cumero Fire burned on the international border of the United States and [[Mexico]], impacting ranch lands, recreational areas, transportation, and cell tower equipment in the area. A temporary flight restriction was put in place for the fire impacted area on July 5.&lt;ref name="IW75"/&gt;

{{other uses|DOA (disambiguation)}}
{{unreferenced|date=November 2016}}
'''Dead on arrival''' ('''DOA'''), also '''dead in the field''' and '''brought in dead''' ('''BID''') indicates that a patient was found to be already [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] upon the arrival of professional medical assistance, often in the form of [[first responder]]s such as [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, or [[police]].

In some jurisdictions, first responders must consult verbally with a [[physician]] before officially pronouncing a patient deceased, but once [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] is initiated, it must be continued until a physician can pronounce the patient dead.

==Medical DOA==
When presented with a patient, medical professionals are required to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) unless specific conditions are met which allow them to pronounce the patient as deceased. In most places, these are examples of such criteria:
* Injuries not compatible with life. These include but are not necessarily limited to [[decapitation]] or other catastrophic brain trauma, [[incineration]], severed body, and injuries that do not permit effective administration of CPR. If a patient has sustained such injuries, it should be intuitively obvious that the patient is non-viable. 
* ''[[Rigor mortis]]'', indicating that the patient has been dead for at least a few hours. ''Rigor mortis'' can sometimes be difficult to determine, so it is often used reported along with other determining factors.
* Obvious [[Decomposition#Stages of decomposition|decomposition]].
* ''[[Livor mortis]]'' (lividity), indicating that the body has been pulseless and in the same position long enough for blood to sink and collect within the body, creating purplish discolorations at the lowest points of the body (with respect to [[gravity]]).
* [[Stillbirth]]. If it can be determined without a doubt that an infant died prior to birth, as indicated by skin blisters, an unusually soft head, and an extremely offensive odor, resuscitation should not be attempted. If there is even the slightest hope that the infant is viable, CPR should be initiated; some jurisdictions maintain that life-saving efforts should be attempted on all infants to assure parents that [[Futile care|all possible actions were performed to save their child, futile as the medical professionals may have known them to be]]. 
* Identification of valid [[do not resuscitate]] orders.

This list may not be a comprehensive picture of medical practice in all jurisdictions or conditions. For example, it may not represent the standard of care for patients with terminal diseases such as advanced cancer. In addition, jurisdictions such as [[Texas]] permit withdrawal of medical care from patients who are deemed unlikely to recover. {{further|Texas Futile Care Law}}

Regardless of the patient, a pronouncement of [[death]] must always be made with absolute certainty and only after it has been determined that the patient is not a candidate for resuscitation. This type of decision is rather sensitive and can be difficult to make.

Legal definitions of death vary from place to place; for example, irreversible brain-stem death, prolonged [[clinical death]],  etc.

==Colloquial use==
*When, as with computers, product complexity is high and diagnostics are involved, the medical metaphor is perhaps appropriate, as [[boot image control|complex diagnostics]] might be required to determine if the product "is really dead".
*In another context, "dead on arrival" may be used to describe an idea or product that is considered to be fundamentally flawed, and therefore viewed as an utter failure from the start.

[[File:The Diary of a Young Girl at the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg|thumb|A [[facsimile]] of the [[The Diary of a Young Girl|original diary]] of [[Anne Frank]] on display in [[Berlin]]]]

A '''diary'''  is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by [[Calendar date|date]] reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a [[list of diarists|diarist]]. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ''[[Hansard]]''), business [[ledger]]s, and military [[Service record|record]]s. In British English, the word may also denote [[diary (stationery)|a preprinted journal format]].

Today the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. The word "journal" may be sometimes used for "diary," but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.

Although a diary may provide information for a [[memoir]], [[autobiography]] or [[biography]], it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of [[Ned Rorem]], [[Alan Clark]], [[Tony Benn]] or [[Simon Gray]]) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous) or simply for profit.

By extension the term '''diary''' is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats (e.g. [[blog]]s).

==Etymology==
The word ''diary'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diarium'' ("daily allowance," from ''dies'' "day").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diary|title= Diary|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''journal'' comes from the same root (''diurnus'' "of the day") through [[Old French]] ''jurnal'' (modern [[French language|French]] for ''day'' is ''jour'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/journal?show=0&amp;t=1341691218|title=Journal|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of the word refers to a book in which a daily record was written was in [[Ben Jonson]]'s comedy ''[[Volpone]]'' in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diary&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Diary|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest extant diaries come from [[Middle East]]ern and [[East Asia]]n cultures, although the even earlier work ''To Myself'' (Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν), today known as the ''[[Meditations]]'', written in Greek by the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. [[Pillowbook]]s of [[Japan]]ese court ladies and [[Asia]]n travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China.

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] diaries were written from before the 10th century. The earliest surviving diary of this era which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna' in the 11th century. His diary is the earliest known to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Diary in Islamic Historiography: Some Notes|first=George|last=Makdisi|journal=History and Theory|volume=25|issue=2|date=May 1986|pages=173–85|doi=10.2307/2505304|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=2505304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursors of the diary in the modern sense include daily notes of [[Christian mysticism|medieval mystics]], concerned mostly with inward emotions and outward events perceived as spiritually important (e.g. [[Elizabeth of Schönau]], [[Agnes Blannbekin]], and perhaps also, in the lost vernacular account of her visions, [[Beatrice of Nazareth]]).

From the [[Renaissance]] on, some individuals wanted not only to record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'' that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the [[Florence|Florentines]] [[Buonaccorso Pitti]] and [[Gregorio Dati]] and the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Marino Sanuto the Younger]]. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.

In 1908 the [[Smythson]] company created the first featherweight diary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smythson.com/corporate-diaries|title=Smythson.com|work=smythson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling diaries to be carried about.&lt;ref&gt;p.181 Moss, Victoria ''The Archivists'' ''In Style'' October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published diaries==
[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Samuel Pepys]]]]
[[Image:200px-Faustina.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Faustina Kowalska]]]]

Many diaries of notable figures have been published and form an important element of [[autobiography|autobiographical]] literature.

[[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) is the earliest diarist who is well known today; his diaries, preserved in [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary beyond mere business transaction notation, into the realm of the personal. Pepys' contemporary [[John Evelyn]] also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important [[primary source]]s for the [[English Restoration]] period, and consist of [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of many great events, such as the [[Great Plague of London]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].

The practice of posthumous publication of diaries of literary and other notables began in the 19th century. As examples, the ''Grasmere Journal'' of [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] (1771–1855) was published in 1897; the Journals of [[Fanny Burney]] (1752–1840) were published in 1889; the diaries of [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] (1776–1867) were published in 1869.

Among important [[U.S. Civil War]] diaries are those of [[George Templeton Strong]], a [[New York City]] lawyer, and [[Mary Boykin Chesnut|Mary Chesnut]], the wife of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer. The diary of [[Jemima Condict]], living in the area of what is now [[West Orange, New Jersey]], includes local observations of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Since the 19th century the publication of diaries by their authors has become commonplace &amp;ndash; notably amongst politicians seeking justification but also amongst artists and litterateurs of all descriptions. Amongst late 20th-century British published political diaries, those of [[Richard Crossman]], [[Tony Benn]] and [[Alan Clark]] are representative, the latter being more indiscreet in the tradition of the diaries of [[Chips Channon]]. In Britain in the field of the arts notable diaries were published by [[James Lees-Milne]], [[Roy Strong]] and [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]].

One of the most famous modern diaries, widely read and translated, is the posthumously published ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' by [[Anne Frank]], who wrote it while in hiding during the German occupation of [[Amsterdam]] in the 1940s. [[Otto Frank]] edited his daughter's diary and arranged for its publication after the War. Many edits were made before the diary was published in other countries. This was due to the sexually explicit material, which also led to some libraries banning the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/section9.rhtml|title=SparkNotes: Diary of a Young Girl: March 14, 1944–April 11, 1944|work=sparknotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of diaries was also often practiced from the 20th century onwards as a conscious act of self-exploration (of greater or lesser sincerity) &amp;ndash; examples being the diaries of [[Carl Jung]], [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Anaïs Nin]].&lt;ref&gt;This practice is explored in Tristine Rainer, ''The New Diary'', 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Among important diaries by 20th-century literary figures are those of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and the French writer Paul Léautaud (1872–1956). The self-reflective ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'' written by [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina]] contains accounts of her visions and conversations with Jesus.

A strong psychological effect may arise from having an audience for one's self-expression, even if this is the book one writes in, only read by oneself – particularly in adversity. Anne Frank went so far as to address her diary as "Kitty." [[Friedrich Kellner]], a court official in [[Nazi Germany]], thought of his diary as a weapon for any future fight against tyrants and terrorism, and named it "Mein Widerstand," ''[[My Opposition]]''. [[Victor Klemperer]] was similarly concerned with recording for the future the tyrannies and hypocrisies of Nazi Germany and of its [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] successor state in his diaries. In none of these cases, however, did the authors anticipate early – or indeed any – publication.

==Internet diaries==
{{main article|Online diary|Blog}}

As [[internet]] access became commonly available, many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience. The first [[online diary]] is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's "Open Diary," published at the [[MIT Media Lab]] website from 14 November 1994 until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;a [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115535/http://geocities.com/pinhanez/open_diary/open_diary.htm copy] of his "open diary" is still in existence&lt;/ref&gt; Other early online diarists include [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal online diary-writing in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=9 June 2006 | first=Reyhan | last=Harmanci}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Burke, who started publishing "Carolyn's Diary" on 3 January 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diary.carolyn.org|title=Carolyn's Diary Museum|work=carolyn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary ''The Semi-Existence of Bryon'' in a [[USENET]] newsgroup on 19 April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.announce/browse_frm/thread/7a77561b5796150e/34c1097809c9529b#34c1097809c9529b|title= USENET announcement|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of [[Michael Shiner]], a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner.html John G. Sharp,  "The Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813-1869, ''Naval History and Heritage Command'', 2015, retrieved October 5, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based services such as [[Open Diary]] (started in October 1998) and [[LiveJournal]] (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate [[online publishing]], but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of [[blog]]s. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in an encrypted format, such as 256-bit AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device.

==Digital diaries==

With the popularization of [[mobile apps]], diary or journaling apps have become available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Proponents cite the following as primary reasons for journaling with digital applications: Ease and speed of typing; mobile portability; search capabilities; entry location, date, and other metadata from mobile phones; and, tags and other organizational features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://bakarichavanu.com/2014/07/08/10-reasons-i-prefer-digital-journal-writing-over-pen-and-paper/|title=10 Reasons I Prefer Digital Journal Writing Over Pen and Paper|date=14 July 2014| first=Bakari | last=Chavanu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital diaries also seem tailored towards shorter-form, in-the-moment writing, similar to user engagement with [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and other social media services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one |title =Day One: journal app nirvana in the Twitter age |first = E |last = Hamburger |date = 3 August 2012 |work = ''[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of diaries==

=== Personal organizer ===

A personal organizer is a form of diary to  list actions and tasks for the day are recorded in a   log, often  using symbols to differentiate and categorize items.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ward |first=Jewel |date=18 December 2013 |title=The 'bullet journal': a new time organizing method or a recycled idea? |url=http://www.tamingdata.com/2013/12/18/the-bullet-journal-a-new-time-organizing-method-or-a-recycled-idea/ |website=tamingdata.com |accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet journal===
A diet journal or food diary is a daily record of all food and beverage consumed as a means of tracking [[calorie]] consumption for the purpose of weight loss or other nutritional monitoring.

===Sleep diary===
A [[sleep diary]] or sleep log is a tool used in the diagnosis and treatment of [[sleep disorder]]s or to keep track of dreams had in order to gain insight to the subconscious or for other further contemplating.

===''Tagebuch''===
The [[German language|German]] ''Tagebuch'' ("day-book") is normally rendered as "diary" in English, but the term encompasses workbooks or working journals as well as diaries proper.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andreas Dorschel, 'Denktagebücher: Zur Poetik des philosophischen Journals', ''Philosophische Rundschau'' LX (2013), no. 4, pp. 264–298.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the notebooks of the Austrian writer [[Robert Musil]] and of the German-Swiss artist [[Paul Klee]] are called ''Tagebücher''.

===Travel journal===
A [[travel journal]], travel diary, or road journal, is the documentation of a journey or series of journeys.

===War diary===
A [[war diary]] is a regularly updated official record of a military unit's administration and activities during wartime maintained by an officer in the unit.

==Fictional diaries==
{{main category|Fictional diaries}}
There are numerous examples of [[fiction]]al diaries. One of the earliest printed fictional diaries was the humorous ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' by [[George Grossmith]] and his brother Weedon. 20th-century examples include radio broadcasts (e.g. ''[[Mrs. Dale's Diary]]'') and published books (e.g. the ''Diaries of [[Adrian Mole]]''). Both prompted long-running [[satire|satirical]] features in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'': the former entitled ''[[Mrs Wilson's Diary]]'' in reference to [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Wilson]], wife of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]], the latter entitled "The Secret Diary of John Major Aged 47¾" and written as a pastiche of the [[Adrian Mole]] diaries from the perspective of the then-Prime Minister [[John Major]]. Another famous example of fictional diaries as prose is Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''. A modern example includes the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid series|''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' series]] where each book of the series is written in a first-person view of the main character, as if the book were an actual diary. Other examples are the ''[[Bert Diaries]]'' and the cellphone diaries in the Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] television series ''[[Future Diary]]''.

'''Environmental emergencies''' are defined as “sudden-onset disasters or accidents resulting from natural, technological or human-induced factors, or a combination of these, that causes or threatens to cause severe environmental damage as well as loss of human lives and property.” (UNEP/GC.22/INF/5, 13 November 2002.)

Following a disaster or conflict, an environmental emergency can occur when people’s health and livelihoods are at risk due to the release of hazardous and noxious substances, or because of significant damage to the ecosystem. Examples include fires, [[oil spill]]s, [[chemical accident]]s, [[toxic waste dump]]ing and [[groundwater pollution]]. 

The environmental risks can be acute and life-threatening. According to the International Disaster Database ([http://www.emdat.be/ EM-DAT]), between 2003 and 2013, there were 380 industrial accidents reported, affecting 207 668 people and resulting in over US$22 million in losses. Climate change is having an unprecedented effect on the occurrence of natural disasters and the associated risk of environmental emergencies. With climate change already stretching the disaster relief system, future climate-related emergency events will generate increased and more costly demands for assistance.


== Context ==
All disasters have some environmental impacts.  

Some of these may be immediate and life-threatening – for example, when an earthquake damages an industrial facility, which in turn releases hazardous materials. In such cases these so-called ‘secondary impacts’ may cause as much damage as the initial causal factor. 

For example, Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda that struck the Philippines in November 2013, caused massive destruction and had a huge human toll but also generated a spill of around 800,000 litres of heavy oil, when a power barge ran aground in Estancia, Iloilo province, at the height of the typhoon. 

Disasters may also have longeOÑKL-term impacts. For example, natural disasters may cause long-term waste management or [[ecosystem]] damage.

== Major international conferences ==
The Environmental Emergencies Forum is a unique biennial international forum that brings together disaster managers and environmental experts from governments, [[UN]] agencies, industries, academies, NGOs and civil society to improve prevention, preparedness, response and overall resilience to environmental emergencies. It also provides guidance for the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, which provides a Secretariat to the meeting. The most recent meeting was held in Norway in June 2015. The next meeting will be held in Nairobi in June 2017.

== Relevant organizations ==

===United Nations===
The Joint [http://www.unep.org/ United Nations Environment Programme] (UNEP)/[http://www.unocha.org/ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] (OCHA) Environment Unit (JEU): By pairing the UNEP’s technical expertise with OCHA’s humanitarian response network, the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit (JEU) mobilizes and coordinates a comprehensive response to environmental emergencies to protect lives, livelihoods, ecosystems and future generations. The JEU can be reached 24 hours/day, seven days/week, all year round and operates at the request of affected countries. The JEU can be called by member states when acute environmental risks to life and health as a result of conflicts, natural disasters and industrial accidents are suspected. 

The JEU hosts the Environmental Emergencies Centre ([http://www.eecentre.org/ www.eecentre.org]),  an online tool designed primarily to provide national responders with a one-stop-shop of all information relevant to the preparedness, prevention and response stages of an environmental emergency.

== Green Star Awards ==
The biennial [http://www.gcint.org/green-star-awards Green Star Awards] recognize individuals, organizations, governments and companies who demonstrate achievements in prevention, preparedness and response to environmental emergencies. A joint initiative between Green Cross International, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Green Star Awards seeks to increase awareness of environmental emergencies by drawing attention to efforts made to prevent, prepare for and respond to such emergencies.

A '''fence''', also known as a '''receiver''', '''mover''', or '''moving man''', is an individual who [[mens rea|knowingly]] buys [[stolen goods]] in order to later resell them for profit. The fence acts as a [[wikt:middleman|middleman]] between [[thieves]] and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may not be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: ''The burglar fenced the stolen radio''. This sense of the term came from [[Thieves' cant|thieves' slang]], first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a ''defence'' against being caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.word-detective.com/2013/09/fence/ "Fence"] in the Word Detective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fence |title='&amp;#39;Online Etymology Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a "c" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly [[American English]]) is now spelled ''defense.''

The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he/she is able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for "hot" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. The thieves who patronize the fence are willing to accept a low [[profit margin]] in order to reduce their risks by instantly "washing their hands" of the [[black market]] loot and disassociating themselves from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups their investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing [[serial numbers]]) and reselling the goods as near to the [[white market]] price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a [[pawnshop]], [[flea market]] or [[street vendor]]) in order to "launder" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. &lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wilber |first= Del Quentin |authorlink= Del Quentin Wilber |title= D.C.

==Approach==

[[File:Car window burglary.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Car stereo thieves typically want to sell stolen items quickly. By selling to fences, they avoid the hassle and suspicion of selling directly to the final buyers.]]
The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to pay thieves a very low price for stolen goods. Thieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort ([[transaction costs]]), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any [[used good]]s, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement.

The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace [[serial number]]s on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognized. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle [[chop shop|may be disassembled]] so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops.

Fencing is often conducted through legal businesses.&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt; Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming "front" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, "front" businesses might be discount stores, [[used goods]] stores, a coin and gem store, [[auction house]], [[flea market]], or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each "front" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]] may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline.

The prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question.  Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value.  Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items.  At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt; For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.

Research on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based "wheeling and dealing".  They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods).  Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

There are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorizing fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorizing fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional "sideline" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the "master fences", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

The degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).

== History of receiving ==

The fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society.
 
=== Early modern England ===

Receiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious [[Jonathan Wild]]. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Receiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the [[Transportation Act 1717|1718 Transportation Act]], which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.&lt;ref name="B189"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.189-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
Proceedings stored in the [http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/ Old Bailey Online] archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664. Of these, 1973 have a verdict category of guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/stats.jsp?y=&amp;x=&amp;countBy=&amp;render=&amp;_offences_offenceCategory_offenceSubcategory=theft_receiving&amp;_verdicts_verdictCategory_verdictSubcategory=guilty&amp;_punishments_punishmentCategory_punishmentSubcategory=&amp;_defendantNames_defendantGender=&amp;defendantAgeFrom=&amp;defendantAgeTo=&amp;_victimNames_victimGender=&amp;victimAgeFrom=&amp;victimAgeTo=&amp;_divs_fulltext=&amp;kwparse=and&amp;fromMonth=&amp;fromYear=&amp;toMonth=&amp;toYear= Old Bailey Proceedings Online] (www.oldbaileyonline.org, 22 November 2015), Searched Old Bailey Proceedings for all offences where offence category is receiving and verdict category is guilty.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1718 Transportation Act also made a felony of returning goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.41-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers.
[[File:Ticket to the hanging of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|Ticket to the hanging of [[Jonathan Wild]]. ]]
In order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was in a better position to do so than [[thief-takers]]. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as "pretended Thiefe-taker" in a 1707 document,&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beattie, , J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.159-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.

Confirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of [[Charles Hitchen]], who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief-takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld. Hitchen controlled this network through his official (that is to say, legal) position as a thief-taker.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, pp.253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synergy between receiving, theft and corruption, as well as official activities such as thief-taking or pawnbroking was a huge dynamic bond where each element enhanced the others in a vicious circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The master of this powerful synergy of London underworld was [[Jonathan Wild]], who rapidly replaced his previous master, Charles Hitchen, in 1713, and rapidly gained control of London's crime and the title of "thief-taker general". His power was due to his ruthless thief-taking and intimidation activities as well as a complex web of intelligence also built around the diffusion of newspapers. However, overly bold receiving was his undoing,&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as "Jonathan Wild Act",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock and Schoemaker. Tales from the Hanging Court. London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from £40 to £140).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;

=== Early modern English literature ===

Receiving grew increasingly important in Early Modern society, and combined with the increasing interest of society on reading, it became the source for many writers, such as [[Daniel Defoe]], with [[Moll Flanders]] and [[John Gay]], with [[The Beggar's Opera]]. 
These works reflect how receiving was conceived and portrayed by authors.

==== Moll Flanders ====

''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is a novel intended to narrate the whole life of its protagonist, referred to as Moll Flanders, but a relevant part of it is about her becoming a master thief. Moll's activity as a thief largely relied on the protection and support of her governess, who acted also as a receiver for the goods stolen by her affiliates. She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates "I was now at a loss for a market for my goods,[...] At last I resolved to go to my old governess." Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves.&lt;ref name="gut"/&gt; With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London.

The Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market. Sometimes, such as in the case of a silver inscribed mug stolen by Moll, she smelts metals, in order to avoid getting caught while re-selling. Along with receiving activity, she actively protects and support many criminals and thieves in order to secure a steady income to her activity.

The same governess goes on in protecting and offering refuge to her affiliates whenever possible, or recruiting thieves into small groups, always via middlemen, in order to protect their thieves' identities in case some of them were caught and willing to confess.

She is also a main intelligence source and often a direct instigator to theft such as in a case of fire in a well-off house in the neighbourhood (more vulnerable to theft because of the sudden emergency), and finally becomes a broker for goods stolen by Moll to a drunken gentleman. In that case, the amount gained is allegedly greater than what she would have gained by standard re-selling in the secondary market.&lt;ref name="gut"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/370/370-h/370-h.htm The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders &amp;c. on Project Gutenberg], accessed on November 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governess embodies female social cunning in London's underworld, from Defoe's point of view. She is a typical receiver of her time, and whereas many male receivers used thief-taking as an official business, she relies on pawnbroking.

==Legal aspects==
Fencing is illegal almost everywhere, usually under a similar rationale as in the United States, where [[receipt of stolen property]] is a crime in every state, as well as a [[federal crime]] if the property crossed a state line. Occasionally federal agents will temporarily set up a false fence [[sting operation]].  Fencing is a common source of income for organized crime.  In [[England and Wales]], as in many U.S. states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

[[Pawnbroker]]s have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Bill.

== E-fencing ==

[[File:US Army 51805 Post, AAFES combat increases in juvenile shoplifting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stores have complained that increasingly, shoplifters are stealing goods with the intent of selling them anonymously online. In this photo, a store loss-prevention officer scans the security cameras for shoplifters.]]
E-fencing is the sale of items on the Internet that have been obtained illegally. It is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website [[eBay]], being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property.&lt;ref name="Ebay"&gt;April 11, 2009. EBay: brisk bidding in stolen goods. business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article6074448.ece&lt;/ref&gt;   Classified websites like [[Craigslist]], [[AutoTrader.com]], [[Pennysaver]] online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal [[darknet market]]s.

E-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen [[credit card]]s or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with [[Carding (fraud)|carding]], which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means.

Crime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand.  In the United States, major retailers such as [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing.  Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and [[Amazon.com]]) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property.  Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.&lt;ref name ="seattletimes"&gt;Spencer, Jim.

[[Minneapolis]] ''[[Star Tribune]]''.  Accessed June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[eBay]] spokesman has stated, "Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay," and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm Online auctions are the newest place to hawk stolen goods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225090233/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm |date=February 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierce |first=Tarik |url= http://www.investortrip.com/how-to-solve-ebays-efencing-problem/ |title=Efencing Theft Problems on eBay |publisher=Investortrip.com |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Francop Affair''''' was a [[high seas]] incident on November 4, 2009 in which the [[Israeli Navy]] seized the cargo ship [[MV Francop|MV ''Francop'']] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and its cargo of hundreds of tons of weapons allegedly bound from [[Iran]] to [[Hezbollah]]. The incident is also known by its military operation name, '''Operation Four Species'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126397.html|title=Report: U.S. stopped Israel from attacking 'Hezbollah arms ship'|date=6 November 2009|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Israeli commanders had received intelligence reports that the ship {{MV|Francop}} was carrying weapons originating from [[Iran]], which were to be transferred to [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The ship was about {{convert|160|km|-1}} off the coast of [[Israel]], near [[Cyprus]], when it was stopped.

On November 4, 2009, the ship was radioed by an Israeli Navy [[missile boat]], which ordered it to halt and prepare for inspection. [[Shayetet 13]] naval [[commando]]s then boarded the ship without resistance.  The navy said that the crew was not aware of the purported smuggling and cooperated with the commandos.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; The commandos broke open the shipping containers and discovered crates of weapons and munitions hidden between sacks of polyethylene stacked along the openings and sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLCLYVjwomQ|title=IDF Navy commandoes board the Francop|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) said the ship was carrying "dozens of shipping containers, carrying numerous weapons, disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board". After boarding, the Israeli navy directed the ship to the Israeli [[port of Ashdod]] where a thorough inspection was held.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in [[Damietta]], [[Egypt]]; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Iran]] on October 25.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anshel |last=Pfeffer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126069.html |title=Israel seizes ship in Mediterranean carrying more than 3,000 rockets |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was then set to sail to [[Limassol]], Cyprus and then [[Latakia]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;  The IDF suspects that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. Following the war, [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Resolution 1701]] forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah. In 2010, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929]] authorized states to seize items, including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting.

An Israeli naval chief said that the amount of weapons found is ten times more than that found during [[Operation Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="Ynet"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hanan |last=Greenberg |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3800306,00.html |title=Navy: 10 times more arms on ship than on Karin-A |publisher=[[Ynet]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms shipment weighed 320 tons and were held in containers marked with Iranian shipping codes.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |first=Teibel |last=Amy |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h3S0DqyLu9CfgcBASy2XHOGCk0IAD9BPAIG80 |title=Hezbollah denies link to arms ship |publisher=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news | url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455195197&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708082606/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455195197&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-08 | title=The haul: 320 tons of Katyushas, other rockets, shells and bullets | last=Katz | first=Yaakov | date=2009-11-05 | work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | publisher=jpost.com | accessdate=2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seized weaponry consisted of 9,000 [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]], 2,125 107-mm [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]]s, 685 rocket fuses, 690 122-mm rockets, 21,100 F-1 fragmentation hand grenades, and 566,220 [[AK-47]] rounds.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh-pnuMJh3o&amp;feature=related|title=Slide Show of Weaponry Found on The 'Francop'|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Israeli military said that the shipment was equivalent to about ten percent of Hezbollah's stocks.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; The arms shipment was the largest ever seized by Israel.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The first austerity package was the first in a row of [[Greek government-debt crisis countermeasures|countermeasures]] to counter the [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. It was approved by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in early 2010.

The purpose was to reduce the [[Budget deficits|budget deficit]]. These measures preceded the [[First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece]] known as "momerandum". It emerged after the promise of the Greek prime minister in the [[World Economic Forum]] of [[Davos]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No EU bailout for Greece as PM promises to 'put house in order'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/28/greece-papandreou-eurozone|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised that he would take measures to cut the deficit. The package was implemented on 9 February 2010 and was expected to save €0.8 billion; it included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, as well as cuts in overtime workers, public employees and work-related travel.&lt;ref name="Austerity 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=130472 |title=Πάγωμα μισθών και περικοπές επιδομάτων ανακοίνωσε η κυβέρνηση |trans-title=Government announced cuts and a freeze in salaries |date=9 February 2010 |publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second austerity package was approved by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in March 2010.

On 5 March 2010, amid new fears of bankruptcy, the [[Greek parliament]] passed the "Economy Protection Bill", which was expected to save another €4.8&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ingrid Melander |title= Greek parliament passes austerity bill |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSATH00527020100305?type=usDollarRpt |agency=Reuters  |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures include:&lt;ref name="Austerity 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=issue.el.home&amp;date=04/03/2010&amp;id=137789 |title=Αξέχαστη (!) και δυσοίωνη η 3η Μαρτίου |trans-title=An unforgettable (!) and ominous 3 March |date=4 March 2010 |publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30% cuts in Christmas, Easter and leave of absence bonuses, a further 12% cut in public bonuses, a 7% cut in the salaries of public and private employees, a rise of [[VAT]] from 4.5% to 5%, from 9% to 10% and from 19% to 21%, a rise of the petrol tax to 15%, a rise in the taxes on imported cars of up to 10%–30%, among others.

On 23 April 2010, after realising the second austerity package failed to improve the country's economic position, the government requested that the [[First bailout package (Greece)|EU/IMF bailout package]] be activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Greece seeks activation of €45&amp;nbsp;billion aid package |work=The Irish Times |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0423/breaking28.html |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103195312/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0423/breaking28.html |archivedate=November 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece needed money before 19 May, or it would face a debt rollover of $11.3bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Greek minister says IMF debt talks are 'going well' |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8642941.stm |publisher=BBC |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Christos Ziotis and Natalie Weeks |title= Greek Bailout Talks Could Take Three Weeks; Bond Payment Looms |publisher=Bloomberg |url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-20/greek-bailout-talks-could-take-three-weeks-bond-payment-looms.html |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Steven Erlanger |title= Europe Looks at the I.M.F.

Shortly after the European Commission, the IMF and ECB set up a tripartite committee (the Troika) to prepare an appropriate programme of economic policies underlying a massive loan. The Troika was led by Servaas Deroose, from the European Commission, and included also [[Poul Thomsen]] (IMF) and Klaus Masuch (ECB) as junior partners. In return the government agreed to implement further measures.&lt;ref name="Austerity 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1129265 |title=Προσφυγή της Ελλάδας στο μηχανισμό στήριξης ανακοίνωσε ο πρωθυπουργός |trans-title=Prime Minister announced Greece appeal to support mechanism |date=23 April 2010 |publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third austerity package came with the signing of the [[First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece]] known as First Memorandum with the [[European Union]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB). It was announced in May 2010 and approved by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in June 2010.

On 1 May 2010, Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] announced a new round of austerity measures, which were described as "unprecedented".&lt;ref name="Helena Smith"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/09/greece-debt-crisis-euro-imf |title= The Greek spirit of resistance turns its guns on the IMF |author=Helena Smith |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes, which aimed to save {{Nowrap|€38 billion}} through 2012, represented the biggest government overhaul in a generation.&lt;ref name="NY Times protest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Reported Killed in Greek Protests|author=Dan Bilefsky|date=5 May 2010|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/world/europe/06greece.html?src=me|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was met with a [[2010–2011 Greek protests|nationwide general strike]] and massive protests, leaving three dead, dozens injured and 107 arrested.&lt;ref name="NY Times protest"/&gt;

The bill was submitted to Parliament on 4 May and approved on 6 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek parliament votes in favour of austerity measures|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8664161.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 August 2013|date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece agrees to cuts package|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-agrees-to-cuts-package-1964747.html|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=11 August 2013|location=London|date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of 160 MPs consisting the [[PASOK]] government majority, 157 MPs supported the bill, while 3 MPs abstained. [[New Democracy (Greece)|ND]], [[SYRIZA]] and [[KKE]] voted against the bill; however, [[Dora Bakoyianni]] of ND voted for the bill in principle and was subsequently expelled from ND. [[Popular Orthodox Rally|LAOS]] voted for the bill.

Further separate votes on 29 and 30 June were held to implement portions of the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/papandreou-wins-enough-votes-to-pass-greek-budget-bill-ensuring-bailout.html|title=Papandreou Wins Vote on Second Greek Austerity Bill in Bid for More EU Aid|last1=Weeks|first1=Natalie|last2=Bensasson|first2=Bensasson|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/30/greece-minister-eurogroup-idUSATH00622820110630|title=Greek finance minister welcomes austerity bill approval|last=Maltezeu|first=Renee|agency=Reuters|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implementation====

On 2 May 2010, a loan agreement was reached between Greece, the other eurozone countries, and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The deal consisted of an immediate {{Nowrap|€45 billion}} in loans to be provided in 2010, with more funds available later. The first instalment covered {{Nowrap|€8.5 billion}} of Greek bonds that became due for repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Greek Bailout Talks Could Take Three Weeks|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-20/greek-bailout-talks-could-take-three-weeks-bond-payment-looms.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, {{Nowrap|€110 billion}} was agreed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Gabi Thesing and Flavia Krause-Jackson |title= Greece Gets $146 Billion Rescue in EU, IMF Package |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a9f8X9yDMcdI | publisher=Bloomberg |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kerin Hope |title= EU puts positive spin on Greek rescue |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html |work=Financial Times  |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest for the eurozone loans is 5%, considered to be high for a bailout loan. The [[European Monetary Union]] loans would be ''[[pari passu]]'' and not senior like those of the IMF. The seniority of the IMF loans has no legal basis but is respected nonetheless. The loans should cover Greece's funding needs for the next three years (estimated at €30&amp;nbsp;billion for the rest of 2010 and €40&amp;nbsp;billion each for 2011 and 2012).&lt;ref name="citibank"&gt;Global Economics Flash, Greek Sovereign Debt Restructuring Delayed but Not Avoided for Long, 5 May 2010, "The amount of fiscal tightening announced over the next three years is even larger than we expected: €30 bn worth of spending cuts and tax increases, around 12.5% of the 2009 Greek GDP, and an even higher percentage of the average annual GDP over the next three years (2010–2012). With 5 percentage points of GDP tightening in 2010 and 4 percentage points of GDP tightening in 2011, the economy should contract quite sharply&amp;nbsp;– between 3 and 4 percent this year and probably another 1 or 2 percent contraction in 2011."&lt;/ref&gt; According to EU officials, France and Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Why the Euro Crisis is a Political Crisis |url= http://forexnewsnow.com/top-stories/why-the-euro-crisis-is-a-political-crisis |publisher=ForexNewsNow  |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; demanded that their military dealings with Greece be a condition of their participation in the financial rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Christopher Rhoads |title= The Submarine Deals That Helped Sink Greece  |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703636404575352991108208712 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=10 July 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010|5|12}}, the deficit was down 40% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="sd100514"/&gt;

====Negotiations====

====Approval====
In February, facing [[sovereign default]], Greece needed more funds from the IMF and EU by 20 March, and was negotiating over a €130 billion lending package. On 10 February, the Greek cabinet approved the draft bill of a new austerity plan, which was calculated to improve the 2012 budget deficit with €3.3 billion (and a further €10 billion improvement scheduled for 2013 and 2014). The austerity plan includes:&lt;ref name="SZ-staat-neu"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/sparpaket-in-griechenland-der-ganze-staat-soll-neu-gegruendet-werden-1.1282482 | title=Der ganze Staat soll neu gegründet werden | publisher=Sueddeutsche | date=13 February 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-13/greece-votes-in-favour-of-austerity-plan/3826308 | title=Greece MPs clear way for $170bn bailout | publisher=ABC News | date=13 February 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 22% cut in minimum wage from €750 to €585 per month
* Permanently cancel holiday wage bonuses (one extra month's pay each year)
* 150,000 jobs cut from state sector by 2015, including 15,000 by the end of 2012
* Pension cuts worth €300 million in 2012
* Changes to laws to make it easier to lay off workers
* Health and defence spending cuts
* Industry sectors are given the right to negotiate lower wages depending on economic development
* Opening up closed professions to allow for more competition, particularly in the health, tourism, and real estate sectors
* Privatisations worth €15 billion by 2015, including Greek gas companies [[DEPA]] and [[DESFA]]. In the medium term, the goal remains at €50 billion

The latest round of austerity measures meant that Greece would face at least another year of recession before the economy started to grow again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/95df9026-5983-11e1-8d36-00144feabdc0.html |title=Grim effects of austerity show on Greek streets |author=Kerin Hope |date=17 February 2012 |newspaper=The Financial Times |accessdate=19 February 2012 |quote="At least I'm not starving, there are bakeries that give me something, and I can get leftover souvlaki [kebab] at a fast-food shop late at night", [one homeless Greek] says.

Showing disagreement, transport minister [[Makis Voridis]] from the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] party, along with five deputy ministers from various ministries, resigned.&lt;ref name=smh2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek government approves debt deal|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/greek-government-approves-debt-deal-20120211-1sxxf.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February, Papademos warned of "social explosion and chaos" if the parliament did not approve the deal the next day. Speaking to members of Parliament before their vote, Papademos stated that if the majority voted against the austerity measures, the government would not be able to pay employee salaries. On 13 February, the Greek Parliament subsequently the measures 199 to 74. During the parliamentary debate, massive protests were witnessed in Athens that left stores looted and burned and more than 120 injured. The riot was one of the worst since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/12/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis/index.html|title=Clashes erupt as Greek Parliament debates austerity measures|date=12 February 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17003432|title=Buildings set ablaze as Greek MPs debate austerity plan|date=12 February 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its position as one of the ruling parties, the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] voted against the plan and withdrew from the government. Forty-three [[Member of parliament|MPs]] from the other two ruling parties (social democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] and conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]) also voted against the plan and were immediately expelled from their parties. This reduced the combined power of these two parties from 236 to 193 seats, still enough for a majority of the 300-seat parliament.&lt;ref name="bailout-vote"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/12/greece-bailout-vote.html | title=Greece passes new austerity deal amid rioting | publisher=CBC News | date=12 February 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was a major precondition for the EU and IMF to jointly release the funds, which are supposed to cover all financial needs in 2012 and 2013, with the hope that Greece can start lending again at the private capital markets in 2014.&lt;ref name="bbc-2012-02-09"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13798000 | title=Q&amp;A: Greek debt crisis | publisher=BBC News | date=9 February 2012 | accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The determination of the Greek leaders to implement the new austerity package was however doubted. For example, [[Antonis Samaras]] (leader of New Democracy) talked about renegotiating the deal, despite voting for the package. Because of this uncertainty, Eurozone finance ministers demanded that Greek main politicians sign a written assurance for their continued support to implement the austerity package, both before and after any elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaffin |first=Joshua |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7cb53ba0-573a-11e1-869b-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/world_europe/feed//product#axzz1mHXI7oHR |title=Eurozone divisions threaten Greece aid |publisher=FT.com |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing the package on 13 February, four other hurdles remained for Greece to receive the new €130 billion bailout loan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/13/uk-greece-steps-idUKTRE81C0XN20120213 | work=Reuters | first=Robin | last=Emmott | title=Factbox – Next steps on path to Greek bailout | date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* €325 million out of the total €3.3 billion austerity package for 2012 needed to be specified in the form of some exact "structural expenditure reductions", to be outlined and passed by a separate bill.
* Written commitments from the main party leaders had to be filed to guarantee their continued support for the program, both before and after elections in April.
* The debt restructure agreement, with a debt write-off worth €107 billion, needed to be implemented by a bond swap in early March, involving at least 95% of the private creditors. Under the terms, all the holders (banks, pension funds, insurers and others) of €206 billion in government bonds, would have to write down the face value of their holdings by 53.5%, by swapping bonds they held for longer-dated securities that pay a lower coupon. When calculated for the bonds with the longest maturity, the 53.5% reduction of face value would be equal to a 74% loss on the net present value of the debt. The agreement included a [[collective action clause]] to force recalcitrant holders to participate.
* A debt sustainability report by the Troika, based upon full implementation of the package and the debt agreement, needed to show a sustainable outlook for the Greek economy, reducing the debt relative to GDP to 120% in 2020.

The seventh austerity package was approved by the Hellenic Parliament in October 2012.

====Specific measures====
Some of the main elements are: 
* Bank recapitalisation
* Tax reform
* Labor market reform
* Pension reform
* The "Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16".

The fiscal plan is an extension of the [[First bailout package (Greece)|initial bailout package]], as it contain the framework for €5.3bn of additional measures (primarily tax hikes) to be implemented in 2015–16 along with the €13.5bn of measures for 2013–14. The extension (and accompanying agreement) were to be covered in more details by a new [[Third bailout package (Greece)|bailout program]] in November 2012

==== History====
The package and reforms were outlined in the [[Second bailout package (Greece)|second bailout agreement]] (March 2012). Initially, the package only dealt with those €13.5bn of measures (comprising €10bn spending cuts and €3.5bn tax hikes) for implementation in fiscal year 2013 and 2014. According to the implementation plan of the [[Second bailout package (Greece)|second bailout agreement]], the measures were expected to have been passed by [[Hellenic Parliament|the Greek parliament]] in June 2012.

The passage of the austerity package was delayed due to political turmoil.  Two parliamentary elections were held, on 6 May and 17 June. Subsequent political calls prompted by a worsened recession asked for a 2-year extension of the bailout programme, and for the politicians to settle the exact content of the measures. This was finalised on 29 October.

====Negotiations====
As of 1 October, the Troika and the government were negotiating a €13.5bn austerity package for 2013–14, of which €10bn was to be implemented as spending cuts and €3.5bn as tax hikes. The government's proposal was that the financial budget for 2013 should implement the first €7.3bn of spending cuts and €0.5bn of tax hikes; with the remaining cuts scheduled for 2014.  According to earlier Troika statements, the report would depend on the level of ambition and seriousness of the government's measures and on the progress on structural reforms and privatisation.

The Troika on 2 October explained to the government that the points agreed to in the [[Second bailout package (Greece)|March 2012 bailout agreement]] had to be effected before the €31.5bn capital payment:&lt;ref name="Negotiation status on 2 October 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_02/10/2012_464241|title=Troika steps up demands |publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* €13.5 billion austerity package for 2013 and 2014, of which the Troika needed the government to deliver a specification of how they would achieve €1.5 billion spending cuts for 2013 (mostly related to cuts for the health sector, defence, reform of local authorities and public sector) and €2 billion measures scheduled for 2014 (mostly related to tax hikes).
* Four structural reforms:
** Liberalization of professions previously legally protected against competition
** Deregulation of goods, services and energy markets
** Creation of a new body to manage state procurements
** Merging health insurance providers with the National Organization for Healthcare Provision (EOPYY)
The Troika reportedly pushed for lower minimum wages and a 30% reduction of the compensation paid to dismissed employees. This proposal was rejected by the government. Another point of disagreement was whether 20,000 civil servants should be simply laid off (recommended by the Troika) or placed in a so-called "labor reserve scheme" at a reduced wage for two years before having their status re-evaluated (preferred by the government).&lt;ref name="Negotiation status on 2 October 2012"/&gt;

On 3 October sources from the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Finance]] revealed that the Troika had asked the government to frontload the austerity package with measures of €9.3bn in 2013 with the remaining €4.2bn to be implemented in 2014. The Troika expected a slightly worse GDP decline in 2013 compared to the government forecast and that the economy subsequently would recover faster if the austerity package frontloaded its savings for 2013. According to ''Kathimerini'', the extra €0.6bn of increased savings in 2013 would most likely be found by removing all Christmas, Easter and summer bonus payments for civil servants, equal to €1000 per year for each civil servant.&lt;ref name="Negotiation status on 3 October 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_03/10/2012_464427|title=Troika wants faster cuts: Inspectors want Athens to increase reductions for 2013 to secure overall deal|publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Kathemerini'''s source, the Troika had also indicated they were willing to accept the large tranche of unspecified savings from structural reforms, if the government were ready to accept the frontload of the austerity package. IMF at the same time also called for a decision to liberalise the fuel sector, as their review report of the sector had concluded that Greeks on a yearly basis currently pay about $1bn more for fuel than they should.&lt;ref name="Negotiation status on 3 October 2012"/&gt;

The government attempted to sign a final deal with the Troika about the content and size of the austerity package and 2013 fiscal budget before the scheduled Eurogroup meeting on 8 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathremote_1_30/09/2012_463790|title=Contacts Troika in Athens|language=Greek|publisher=Kathimerini|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=1 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217172657/http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathremote_1_30/09/2012_463790|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Eurogroup approved the content of the negotiated deal, it would be submitted for a final approval by the European heads of state at the EU summit on 18 October.&lt;ref name="Schedule for approval of the austerity package"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_7718_01/10/2012_463997|title=Troika sticks to its guns in austerity talks |publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the exact content of the package needed to be revealed before the Troika can reach its conclusion about the sustainbility of the Greek economy, it was expected this important report appear in the first half of November.&lt;ref name="Troika report slated for Nov.2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100042_04/10/2012_497524 |title=Unsustainable debt, restructuring or new stimulus package |language=Greek |publisher=Kathimerini |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627091851/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100042_04/10/2012_497524 |archivedate=27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October the Troika released the following statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-789_en.htm|title=Statement of the Troika on the review of the Greek Programme|publisher=European Commission|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"The [Greek] authorities and [Troika] staff teams agreed on most of the core measures needed to restore the momentum of reform and pave the way for the completion of the review. Discussions on remaining issues would continue from respective headquarters and through technical representatives in the field with a view to reaching full staff level agreement over the coming days. Furthermore, financing issues would be discussed between the official lenders and Greece."

Responding statements from the government indicated that an agreement about core elements had been agreed. Disagreement remained about labor market reforms, with the government still resisting direct layoffs or wage/pension cuts for public workers. Another outstanding point was that the government requested that the Troika finance a 2-year delay of the fiscal targets in the bailout plan, to avoid the need for the government to pass an additional austerity package (in addition to the €13.5bn) to reach the initial fiscal targets. It was likewise hoped that these additional disagreements could be settled during additional talks with headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_16/10/2012_466346|title=Coalition partners lash out at troika |publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition)|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_18/10/2012_466378|title=Greece's lenders say near austerity deal for fresh aid |publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition)|date=18 October 2012|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the EU summit on 19 October, it was announced the Eurogroup would arrange a conference call on 29 October to approve the final version of the austerity package, and provided this package subsequently was passed by the Greek parliament before 11 November, the Eurogroup was ready to make the decision at  their ordinary meeting at 12 November to accept the release of the bailout funds.&lt;name="Approval roadmap for Austerity package in Q4-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_19/10/2012_466637|title=Samaras meets with Merkel in Brussels |publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition)|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16 October to 12 November===
* 16 Oct: Details for the bank recapitalisation were presented. The size of the recapitalisation was a potential €48bn, of which the first €18bn had already injected into the four biggest banks in the first half of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_19/10/2012_466701 |title=Eurobank: Bond-exchange initiative could trim recap needs |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining recapitalisation was to be performed in three stages. At first the [[Hellenic Financial Stability Fund]] (HFSF) would immediately inject capital to the banks to reach the required 9% capital ratio. At the second stage HFSF would provide financial tools until the end of January, and at the third stage the permanent capital increases should be covered by the private sector by the end of April 2013. Banks with remaining capital inadequacies would find a solution before mid-June 2013. The 3 biggest systemic banks would get the remaining capital amounts covered by HFSF through the issue of common shares (where HFSF in return would pay the banks with EFSF bonds), while smaller banks would have to be either liquidated by HFSF or bought by other banks. The plan is for private shareholders to retain administrative control of the systemic banks, so during the next five years they would have the right at any time to buy back the shares from HFSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_16/10/2012_466348 |title=Bank recapitalization to be split into three steps |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the Troika have dropped their previous requirement for the capital ratios to be further increased to 10% by the end of June 2013.
* 19 Oct: A new reform of the tax system was presented, with a flat rate 28% income tax for self-employed and enterprises, and a general 50% reduction in tax exemptions on property transactions, inheritances and parental donations. Starting from January 2013, all property owners would on a yearly basis have to pay the same single rate for property tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_19/10/2012_466711 |title=Realty tax discounts cut in half |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax-free bonus for families with children would be abolished, and a ceiling would be introduced on exempted expenditures related to healthcare. Another major change is that all social benefits (previously exempted) would be taxed as salary revenues. For corporations the biggest change was that the tax-free threshold of €5,000 per year would be abolished. All in all, the tax reform is expected to increase the government revenues by €3bn per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_24/10/2012_467287 |title=New tax bill to hurt households |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 29 Oct: The Eurogroup working group held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the current debt sustainability in Greece, and potential solutions to improve it. It was decided to reject the call from the Democratic Left to attempt a further revision of the already negotiated labor market reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_29/10/2012_467747 |title=Final stretch for Greece before Eurogroup |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 29 Oct: The government signed a new act that would assign [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek Finance Ministry]] inspectors to monitor public expenditures for all those ministries and state bodies that do not comply with fiscal targets. The act also introduced an automatic mechanism giving the Finance Ministry power to immediately stop excessive expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_29/10/2012_467823|title=Government introduces ministry monitoring system |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 30 Oct:  The country's privatisation agency revised the previous revenue target from €19bn by the end of 2015, to only €11bn by the end of 2016. The revenues collected from the privatisation program was in March 2012 forecasted not only to reduce the debt by €50bn, but also to generate an extra €60bn investments from the buyers, resulting in €3bn extra annual tax revenues for the government and 50,000 jobs; raising annual GDP growth by 1%. During the first 2.5 years after the May 2010 bailout, Greece had managed to sell public assets only worth €1.6bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_16/10/2012_466236 |title=Greece prepares second wave of privatizations |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform was expected to boost the value of exported goods 10%, while also creating 80,000 jobs and resulting in an extra GDP growth of 1.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_01/11/2012_468298 |title=Road map to facilitate export system |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 11 Nov: A draft version of the almost completed and long-awaited Troika surveillance report appeared that outlined the results for the Greek economy, reforms, privatisation programme and debt sustainability. Among other things it claimed that the 2-year extension of the bailout programme would cost €32.6bn of extra loans from the Troika (€15bn in 2013–14 and €17.6bn in 2015–16).&lt;ref name="Troika report November 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sup.kathimerini.gr/xtra/media/files/fin/troika_ekthesi.pdf |title=Troika report (Draft version 11 November 2012) |format=PDF |publisher=European Commission |date=11 November 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065720/http://sup.kathimerini.gr/xtra/media/files/fin/troika_ekthesi.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12 Nov: Eurogroup and IMF agreed to consider a revised bailout plan. The Eurogroup proposed prolonged maturities and lower interest rates on existing loans and/or a debt-buy-back of the remaining privately held government bonds, then  listed with a face value of €63bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_02/11/2012_468463 |title=Debate over buyback, OSI heating up |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debt-buy-back would in practical terms mean that the Troika would buy all the remaining privately held bonds at a price close to the market price; an operation that would need the acceptance of private investors to sell at the offered price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_21/10/2012_466812 |title=German Finance Ministry mulls debt buy-back for Greece, says report |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; If all private investors accepted a debt-buy-back at 30% of face value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_07/11/2012_468857|title=Crucial Greek vote breathes life into bond trade|publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=7 November 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would require the Troika to issue €18.9bn of new debt to finance the transaction, resulting in a net debt reduction for Greece at €44.1bn (equal to a debt-to-GDP ratio decline of 23%).

The crucial passage of the Labor market reform, Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16 and Fiscal budget 2013 resulted in the exclusion of several MPs from the three coalition parties. New Democracy lost 4 of 125, PASOK lost 7 of 26 and Democratic Left lost 3 of 14. The combined majority was reduced to 165/300 and that the majority for the two most reform-friendly parties was only 151 MPs.

===Parliament approval===
On 7 November amidst protests of tens of thousands of people, the Greek parliament narrowly approved another austerity package worth €13.5 billion. Without the vote, the Troika warned, the next instalment of €31.5 billion in financial aid would not be granted.&lt;ref name="ORF-8Nov2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.orf.at/stories/2149983/2149982/ |title=Konservative und Sozialisten dafür |date=8 November 2012 |work=ORF online |publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] |accessdate=8 November 2012 |location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaras told MPs that this package was "definitely the last",&lt;ref name="guardian-7Nov2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/07/eurozone-crisis-greece-strike-austerity-vote |title=Greek parliament narrowly approves €13.5bn austerity package after mass protests – as it happened |author=Phillip Inman |date=7 November 2012 |work=Economics blog |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=8 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some commentators immediately disagreed.&lt;ref name="guardian-7Nov2012"/&gt;

The latest measures cut pension on average between 5% and 15% and increased the retirement age from 65 to 67. Wages of civil servants were cut again by up to 20%.

The parliament failed to elect a president and the [[Cabinet of Antonis Samaras|Samaras Cabinet]] collapsed. The [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|election]] took place on 25 January and the left-wing party [[Syriza]] won the election. The new government tried to adopt anti-austerity politics. In the first quarter of 2015 the Greek economy returned to recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece Back in Recession as Bailout Impasse Drains Economy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-13/greece-returns-to-recession-as-bailout-impasse-drains-economy|publisher=bloomberg.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economy staring at recession again|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168848/article/ekathimerini/business/economy-staring-at-recession-again|publisher=ekathimerini.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deterioration of economy forced the government to accept another bailout, known as the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece]] known as Third Memorandum. This bailout required a new austerity package.

The first round of measures was approved by the Greek parliament on 16 July 2015. The measures include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece debt crisis: Eurozone deal laws backed by MPs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33535205|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Αυτά είναι τα σκληρά μέτρα του νέου μνημονίου|url=http://www.protothema.gr/economy/article/493005/ti-allazei-se-forologia-kai-sudaxeis/|publisher=protothema.gr|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transfer of many products to the high rate [[VAT]] (23%). The lower 13% rate covers fresh food, energy, water and hotel stays. 6% rate covers medicines and press.

The eleventh austerity package was voted by the Greek Parliament as part of the agreement between the Tsipras Government and the 'quartet' of creditors (the IMF, ECB, ESM and EU) for a [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third loan]]. The law contains two parts. The first was the loan agreement while the second contained the measures agreed to secure the first tranche of the new loan.

It was tabled by the government on 13 August 2015 and was approved by parliament on 14 August 2015 with 222 votes for and 64 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Parliament approves third bailout but SYRIZA rebellion grows

====Vote in Parliament====

The Government tabled the Bill containing the measures and the loan agreement in the afternoon of August 13 and requested that it be discussed under the extremely urgent Parliamentary procedure. The bill passed the committees on August 13 and was discussed in the plenary session between 2 am and 10 am of August 14. At 6 am, the MPs decided by vote to shorten the discussion, thus the vote was held earlier than envisioned by the Standing Orders regarding extremely urgent procedures, at 10 am.

====Measures====

The measures passed by this bill were the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bailout deal brings wave of tax hikes|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/200514/article/ekathimerini/business/bailout-deal-brings-wave-of-tax-hikes|date=12 August 2015|accessdate=14 August 2015|website=[[ekathimerini.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human hunting''' refers to humans being [[hunting|hunted]] and killed for other persons' [[revenge]], [[pleasure]], [[entertainment]], [[Sport|sports]] or [[sustenance]]. There have been historical incidents of the practice being carried out during times of social upheaval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A 2016 report by Daniel Wright, senior lecturer in tourism at the University of Central Lancashire, predicts the hunting of the poor will become a hobby of the superrich in a future plagued by economic and ecological disasters and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Daniel |date=April–May 2016 |title=Hunting humans: A future for tourism in 2200|url=|journal=[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]|volume=78–79 |issue= |pages=34–46 |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.03.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical examples ==
*In Ancient Greece, the [[Spartiate|upper class]] of [[Sparta]] regularly practiced the stalking and murder of members of their servile ''[[helot]]'' population; such murders were carried out both by the secret police (''[[Crypteia]]'') as a means of keeping the helots cowed and unlikely to revolt, and as part of the military training (''[[agoge]]'') for Spartiate youths.
*During the [[Spanish Civil War]], a real-world version of this practice became popular among the sons of wealthy landowners. The hunts took place on horseback and targeted landless peasants as an extension of the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]]. They were jokingly referred to as "Reforma agraria" referencing both the grave their quarry would eventually be dumped into, and the [[Background of the Spanish Civil War|land reforms]] the lower classes had been attempting to attain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spain in Our Hearts|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=9780547973180|location=New York, New York|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Bidens took a limousine to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] where they boarded a train for [[Dover, Delaware]].

As former President and Mrs. Obama began their journey to a vacation in California, the Trumps and Pences joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in [[National Statuary Hall]] at the U.S. Capitol. Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former presidents and vice presidents.

A luncheon at the U.S. Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2017 inaugural luncheon, which in the past has often featured dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included more traditional dishes from around the country.&lt;ref name="menu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/trump-inaugural-lunch-menu/ |title=Here's Donald Trump's inaugural lunch menu |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |date=January 17, 2017 |author=Mueller, Eleanor |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121114047/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/trump-inaugural-lunch-menu/ |archivedate=January 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course consisted of [[Maine lobster]] and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, accompanied by a [[J.

For the 2017 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was [[George Caleb Bingham]]'s ''[[The Verdict of the People]]'', which depicts a Missouri town and its citizens both celebrating and mourning the election victory of what historians say was a likely [[proslavery]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/donald-trump-will-eat-his-inaugural-lunch-in-front-of-an-image-of-slavery/2017/01/13/961a31e0-d76e-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html |title=The controversy behind the painting that will hang at Trump's inaugural luncheon |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |date=January 13, 2017 |author=Kennicott, Philip |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122160543/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/donald-trump-will-eat-his-inaugural-lunch-in-front-of-an-image-of-slavery/2017/01/13/961a31e0-d76e-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html |archivedate=January 22, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The german [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) has hosted International Years of Science every year since 2007 with strategically important partner countries like [[China]], [[Brazil]] and [[Russia]] as part of the German government's Internationalization Strategy. The aim is to strengthen long-term cooperation in [[education]] and [[research]], be it through the expansion of [[university collaborations]], the initiation of research and development projects, support for [[vocational education and training]], or by intensifying [[cutting-edge research]].

== Objectives and Priorities ==
In order to achieve the goals of the International Science Years, the german BMBF and the corresponding ministry in the partner country invite research institutions and educational establishments to present their joint projects to the public, to strengthen exchange between young research talent and to launch new collaborations. Examples of activities which are eligible for funding include delegation visits, events, workshops, as well as ‘best practice’ projects which promote cooperation in education and research and in [[science]] and [[technology]].

The key activities of the International Years of Science reflect the research agendas of the respective countries (the "High-Tech Strategy" in the case of Germany) and bilateral agreements on scientific and technological cooperation (STC Agreements). As the previous International Years of Science demonstrate, more and more attention is being given to global challenges of the future like [[climate and energy]], [[health]] and [[nutrition]], [[Academic mobility|mobility]], [[security]] and [[communication]] as well as the task of supporting innovation. This has resulted in ever closer interaction between policy-makers, science and industry.

The goals and activities of the International Science Years are publicized on their own dedicated websites aimed at experts and the general public, which include background information and project descriptions as well as calendars of events. The Years of Science are backed up by a wide-ranging publicity campaign sponsored by the BMBF. 

The International Bureau of the BMBF at the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) supports the BMBF in the coordination and communications activities of the International Years of Science.

=== The German-Egyptian Year of Science and Technology 2007 ===
The motto of the German-Egyptian Year of Science and Technology was 'Linking Scientific Masterminds'. It was jointly launched by the Research Ministers of both countries on 15 January 2007 in [[Cairo]]. Its aim was to bring together scientists, initiate joint research projects and launch bilateral research projects that would strengthen scientific cooperation well beyond 2007. Six research networks in the fields of materials sciences, water, renewable energy, biotechnology, health research and the arts and social sciences represented the core fields of the Year of Science. The application focus and industrial relevance of the bilateral projects in particular were strengthened. In addition, the involvement of new university and non-university partners in Egypt provided a broader basis for cooperation. Examples include the implementation of a German-Egyptian Research Fund (GERF) or the German University of Cairo (GUC). The German-Egyptian Year of Science and Technology and the more than 150 associated events were well received by scientists and scholars as well as the general public. These events included the opening ceremony in Cairo, the multimedia show "Culturama" in Berlin, the open day on the [[research vessel METEOR]] in Port Said, the centennial celebration of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, the exhibition “Egypt’s Sunken Treasures” in Bonn, and the exhibition of mummies and an accompanying academic programme at the Landesmuseum in Stuttgart. As a gateway to the Arab world, Egypt remains one of Germany's most important partner countries in the Middle East. The German University in Cairo opened a campus in Berlin in January 2013.

=== The German-Israeli Year of Science and Technology 2008 ===
The aim of the German-Israeli Year of Science and Technology, which kicked off in [[Berlin]] on 8 April 2008, was to highlight the diversity and excellence of bilateral cooperation in science and to raise awareness in Israel about Germany as a key location for research. Special emphasis was given to cooperation between young scientists from both countries. The Year of Science provided new impetus, for example by focusing on application-oriented R&amp;D collaborations and also by strengthening the humanities and social sciences. The establishment of the Minerva Humanities Center was a milestone in this process. Further key areas of the Year of Science and Technology were the medical sciences, security research and environmental research. In order to improve the prospects of young scientists and scholars and give them special support in the context of German-Israeli cooperation, the BMBF introduced the Award for Research Cooperation and Highest Excellence (ARCHES) for young researchers, which is now conferred on an annual basis. The application and selection procedure is administered by the Minerva Foundation. A major focus of the German-Israeli intergovernmental consultations held in 2012 was on the successful cooperation in cancer research and the start of collaboration in battery research and electrochemistry.

=== German-Chinese Year of Science and Education 2009/10 ===
The slogan "Together on the road to knowledge" was the motto of the German-Chinese Year of Science and Education 2009/10, which took place from March 2009 to June 2010. German and Chinese players in science, education, politics and society came together at more than 200 events, workshops and delegation visits, which included the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]] with young Chinese research talent in attendance, and the BMBF's participation in events jointly organized by Germany and China in Shenyang and Wuhan on the topic of "sustainable urban development" during the campaign “Germany and China – Moving Ahead Together" (DuC), which attracted more than 300,000 visitors each. In addition, students and scientists gathered information on further activities of the Science Year, about German education and research institutions and research funding opportunities. In Germany the first ever “China Weeks” were held at 47 German universities to provide information about the partner country to the public and to draw attention to the potential of German-Chinese cooperation in higher education and research. A film contest was also launched during the Science Year. The BMBF provided funding worth some two million euros to German research projects with a focus on China. Key areas of the cooperation included cutting-edge research on climate, energy and health issues, as well as activities in the areas of vocational training and higher education. The first and second German-Chinese intergovernmental consultations (2011: Berlin; 2012: Beijing) raised cooperation between the two countries to a new level. In total, seven joint declarations on education and research topics were signed during the intergovernmental consultations. The range of topics in the cooperation between the BMBF and China in the higher education sector (students, graduate students, scientist exchanges, universities) and in vocational education and training was addressed in joint activities in various research disciplines such as innovation research, life sciences, environment/ecology, LED technologies, geosciences, marine research or cultural heritage.

=== German-Brazilian Year of Science, Technology and Innovation 2010/11 ===
A large number of events in the field of science, research and education were held in Germany and Brazil from April 2010 to April 2011. The slogan "sustainable:innovative" guided Brazilian and German universities, research institutions, scientists and students as they came together to exchange information on a wide variety of issues related to sustainability and innovation and to launch new bilateral projects. The aim of these activities was to raise awareness of the diversity and excellence of German-Brazilian bilateral science cooperation and to give fresh impetus to scientific and technological cooperation. More than 100 events took place, including 60 'best practice' projects which received more than 1 million euros in funding from the BMBF. Highlights of the Science Year included the Brazil Week at Münster University, a road show in Brazil which showcased Germany as a location for research, the "Eye of the Sky" touring exhibition of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and a promotional tour through Brazil to attract students to come to study in Germany. The German-Brazilian Year launched the foundation of an agricultural research laboratory at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) under the umbrella of the Helmholtz Research Centre Jülich. Since 2012 the two institutions have been working in close cooperation in the field of plant breeding. A workshop on the topic "Creating Value from Bio-Resources", also held during the Science Year, marked the start of greater cooperation in this field of research. The cooperation is meant to help both countries in the development towards a bio-based economy.

=== German-Russian Year of Education, Science and Innovation 2011/12 ===
The German-Russian Year's slogan "Partnership of Ideas" was the motto of more than 200 events held between May 2011 and May 2012. Priority areas included basic research in the field of physics, optical technologies, marine and polar research, information and communication technologies, biological research and biotechnology. A German-Russian collaboration in the area of vocational education and training (VET) led to the establishment of bilateral VET partnerships, and thanks to joint innovation partnerships research results were translated more efficiently into ready-for-market products. Special emphasis was given to the support of young talent: the qualifications of young scientists in both countries were enhanced through German-Russian exchange programmes and partnerships between institutions of higher education. Eighteen select German universities hosted "Russia Weeks" to raise awareness among students, scientists and the general public of the potential of German-Russian cooperation in the higher education sector. German and Russian scientific organizations, research institutions and universities and the ministries of both countries dedicated themselves to further strengthening ties in the areas of education, research and innovation and affirmed their intentions in a number of written agreements. 

The Russia country campaign, which runs from 2012 to 2014 as part of the "Promoting Innovation in Germany" initiative under the umbrella of "Research in Germany", is a continuation of the German-Russian Year of Education, Science and Innovation 2011/2012. Its objective is to further strengthen bilateral cooperation between research and science organizations. The country campaign also supports the marketing projects of German research institutes and innovative businesses. The focus areas of the country campaign are optical technologies, nanotechnology, resource efficiency and health. At the German-Russian intergovernmental consultations in April 2013 both countries emphasized their close cooperation in polar and marine research. Research in this field focuses on the shrinking of the Arctic ice cap and on the reconstruction of the history of the climate over the past 3.6 million years.

=== German-South African Year of Science 2012/2013 ===
The German-South African Year of Science brought together scientists from both countries under the slogan "Enhancing Science Partnerships for Innovation and Sustainable Development" to focus on seven thematic fields: climate change, bioeconomy, urbanization, health innovation, astronomy, social sciences &amp; humanities, and human capital development. One of the most important focus areas of German-South African research activity during the Year of Science was and still is research on climate change, its causes and effects. Projects and workshops on the topic were organized which focussed on closed ecosystems, biodiversity, management of water resources or changes in soils. A total of 200 events took place during the year, including the first joint German-South African expedition to Antarctica on the research vessel Polarstern. The ministries of the two countries sponsored 41 projects in the framework of an ideas competition; contests at schools, summer schools, lecture series and specialist conferences were also held. The establishment of a joint research chair was agreed at the end of the Science Year which will be devoted to one of the seven thematic fields and located at one of South Africa's top universities. Furthermore, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation launched the ‘Neville Alexander Memorial Fund’ with support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

The '''Iraqi conflict (2003–present)''' is a long-running armed conflict that began with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by a [[United States]]-led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|coalition]] that toppled the [[Ba'athist Iraq|government of Saddam Hussein]]. However, the conflict continued as an [[insurgency]] emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011, but became [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|re-involved in 2014]] at the head of a [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve|new coalition]].

==Background==
{{Main|Rationale for the Iraq War|Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations}}
The main rationale for the invasion of Iraq was based on [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] allegations that [[Saddam Hussein]] was developing [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and that he thus presented a threat to his neighbors and to the world community. The U.S. stated "on November 8, 2002, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|Resolution 1441]]. All fifteen members of the Security Council agreed to give Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its obligations and disarm or face the serious consequences of failing to disarm. The resolution strengthened the mandate of the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|UN Monitoring and Verification Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), giving them authority to go anywhere, at any time and talk to anyone in order to verify Iraq's disarmament."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/fs/2003/17926.htm UN Security Council Resolution 1441] Retrieved 30 January 2008  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109053513/http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/fs/2003/17926.htm|date=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 2000s, the administrations of [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] worked to build a case for invading Iraq, culminating in the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]]'s address to the Security Council one month before the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |code=securitycouncil/meeting_4701 |body= Security Council |meeting=4701 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk08 | speakername=[[Colin Powell]]| speakernation=United States|date=5 February 2003 | type= PV| accessdate=2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the invasion, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], and other intelligence agencies largely discredited evidence related to Iraqi weapons as well as links to [[Al-Qaeda]], and at this point the Bush and Blair administrations began to shift to secondary rationales for the war, such as [[Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq|the Hussein government's human rights record]] and promoting democracy in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Smith, Jeffrey R. 2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=R. Jeffrey|title=Hussein's Prewar Ties To Al-Qaeda Discounted|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/05/AR2007040502263.html|publisher=The Washington Post|date=April 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sandalow|first1=Marc|title=Record shows Bush shifting on Iraq war / President's rationale for the invasion continues to evolve|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/NEWS-ANALYSIS-Record-shows-Bush-shifting-on-2690938.php|publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polls showed that people of nearly all countries opposed a war without UN mandate and that the view of the United States as a danger to world peace had significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtin|first1=J.

Accusations of faulty evidence and alleged shifting rationales became the focal point for critics of the war, who charge that the Bush administration purposely fabricated evidence to justify an invasion that it had long planned to launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shakir|first1=Faiz|title=Bush Insists 'I Didn't Want War,' Overwhelming Evidence Suggests Otherwise|url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2006/03/21/4363/made-up-his-mind/|website=ThinkProgress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the war claim that the threat from Iraq and Saddam Hussein was real and that it had later been established. The U.S. led the effort for "the redirection of former Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) scientists, technicians and engineers to civilian employment and discourage emigration of this community from Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2003/27409.htm Redirection of Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Experts Short-term Program] Retrieved 30 January 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109074500/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2003/27409.htm |date=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War (2003–2011)==
{{Main|Iraq War}}

===2003 invasion===
{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}
The invasion of Iraq lasted from 20 March to 1 May 2003 and signaled the start of the [[Iraq War]], which was dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS21405.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Australia]] and [[Poland]] invaded [[Iraq]] and deposed the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist government]] of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.

160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait |publisher=CNN |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition forces also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

The invasion was preceded by an [[airstrike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Governorate|Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]] to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.

===Anti-Coalition insurgency===
{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency (2003–06)}}
Invading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. The rampant looting during this time period, and the inability of U.S.-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein's regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his army in any major battle; the Iraqi army forces simply melted away, often with their weapons, back to their homes. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"&gt;Abdullah, T.A.J., 2006, ''Dictatorship, Imperialism &amp; Chaos: Iraq since 1989'', London, Zed Books&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"/&gt; The de-Ba'athification Commission set up by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"/&gt;

In May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called "[[Sunni Triangle]]", especially in [[Baghdad]] and in the regions around [[Fallujah]] and [[Tikrit]]. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] and the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] militia. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.

Members of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba'ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba'ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim, A.S., 2003, The Insurgency in Iraq, ''Small Wars and Insurgencies'', Volume 14(3), pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, most former members of the Ba'ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces.  However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|disbanding of the Iraqi army]] by [[Paul Bremer]]; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba'ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% of the army officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia.&lt;ref&gt;Gaub, 2011, "Rebuilding Armed Forces: Learning From Iraq And Lebanon", ''Strategic Studies Institute'', pp 3&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners let out of prison by [[Saddam Hussein]] before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"/&gt; Finally, as O'Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlan, M.E., 2005, Iraq Without A Plan, ''Policy Review'', Issue 128, pp 33-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Between 2003 and 2004, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the Coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. Sadr's distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the [[Peace Companies|Mahdi Army]], whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of "evil." Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr's rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement. On March 29, they moved to close Sadr's newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Moqtada Sadr?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as "al-Hawza" and arrested one of his aides on murder charges. That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.

On April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut|al-Kut]], and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]], and [[Basra]]. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.
		
At the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four [[private military company|private military contractor]]s working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] were taking over responsibility for [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar province]], in which Fallujah is located, from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The intended [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] strategy of [[patrolling|patrols]], less aggressive raids, [[humanitarian aid]], and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched [[First Battle of Fallujah|Operation Vigilant Resolve]] to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city. Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in [[Ramadi]], over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]]. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens. Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against Coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months. A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the "Fallujah Brigade", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit's formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&amp;itemid=977 Fallujah Brigade to Disband, Join Resistance in Control of City]&lt;/ref&gt; The city remained under the control of insurgent forces. Reportedly, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.

By the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, [[Samarra]], [[Baqubah|Baquba]], and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi's group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba'athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas. U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's followers]] in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED's and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.

Meanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending the fighting.

On June 28, 2004, the occupation was formally ended by the Coalition, which transferred power to a new [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Ayad Allawi]]. Although many Iraqis were optimistic about the government, militants saw it as little more than an American puppet and continued the fight unabated. On July 18, guerrillas offered a $285,000 reward for Allawi's assassination.

===Sectarian violence===
{{Main|Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–2008)}}
In February 2006, the [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] organization [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn]] (also known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq) [[2006 al-Askari mosque bombing|bombed]] one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam - the [[Al-Askari Shrine|al-Askari Mosque]] in [[Samarra]].

In October 2006, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) and the [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] estimated that more than 370,000 Iraqis had been displaced since the 2006 bombing of the al-Askari Mosque, bringing the total number of Iraqi [[refugee]]s to more than 1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/452fa9954.html|title=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the UNHCR raised the estimate of refugees to a total of about 4.7 million (~16% of the population). The number of refugees estimated abroad was 2 million (a number close to CIA projections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=CIA World Factbook: Iraq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the number of internally displaced people was 2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/iraq?page=briefing&amp;id=4816ef534 UNHCR - Iraq: Latest return survey shows few intending to go home soon].

===Coalition withdrawal===
{{Main|Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
The withdrawal of [[United States Forces – Iraq|U.S. military forces]] from [[Iraq]] was a contentious issue in the United States for much of the 2000s. As the war progressed from its initial invasion phase in 2003 to a nearly decade-long occupation, American public opinion shifted towards favoring a troop withdrawal; in May 2007, 55% of Americans believed that the [[Iraq War]] was a mistake, and 51% of registered voters favored troop withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm|title=Quinnipiac University Poll}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April 2007 [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline for troop withdrawal but [[George W.

The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]'s (ISIS, ISIL) military campaign was very successful, and the group took swathes of territory in northern Iraq during 2014. Violence reached very high levels, with 1,775 people killed in the month of June alone.

===Iraqi–Kurdish conflict===
{{Main|2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict}}

The 2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict occurred in and around the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish region]] of northern [[Iraq]] that began on 15 October 2017, shortly after the [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017|Iraqi Kurdistan referendum in 2017]] was held on September 25. After the independence referendum, Prime Minister [[Haider al-Abadi]] demanded the referendum to be canceled. In October, the Iraqi military moved into the Kurdistan region after the entry of [[ISIL|Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. On 16 October 2017, the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] ignored a deadline given by Iraq to withdraw. This led to  [[Battle of Kirkuk (2017)]], and Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed PMU retaking Kirkuk and its province on 15 October 2017. Within 15 hours, the city of [[Kirkuk]] and the nearby [[K-1 Air Base]], along with surrounding oilfields, were retaken by Iraqi forces. This resulted in the conflict's end.

===Defeat of ISIL===
On December 9, 2017, the last ISIL-held areas in the al-Jazira Desert were captured by the Iraqi military. The prime minister later declared victory, and celebrations occurred soon after.

==ISIL insurgency (2017–present)==
{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2017-present)}}
Following ISIL's defeat, the group has continued an insurgency. However they have been greatly weakened and violence in Iraq has been sharply reduced in 2018. Only 95 people lost their lives during the month of May, the lowest figure in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdobs.com/archive/featured/violence-in-iraq-at-lowest-level-in-10-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J. D. Tippit''' (September 18, 1924 – November 22, 1963) was an American [[police officer]] who was an 11-year veteran with the [[Dallas Police Department]]. About 45 minutes after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, Tippit was shot dead in a residential neighborhood in the Oak Cliff section of [[Dallas]]. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was initially arrested for the murder of Tippit and was subsequently arrested for the killing of President Kennedy. Oswald was charged with both crimes shortly after his arrest. However, Oswald denied involvement in either of the cases. Because Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]] two days after the killings, he could not be prosecuted for either.

==Early life==
Tippit was born near the town of [[Annona, Texas|Annona]] in [[Red River County, Texas]].&lt;ref name=volume26&gt;{{cite book|title=Investigation of the Assassination of President John F.

Tippit married his high school sweetheart, Marie Frances Gasway, on December 26, 1946. The couple had three children: Charles Allan (born 1950), Brenda Kay (born 1953) and Curtis Glenn (born 1958).&lt;ref name="granberry"/&gt; That same year, he went to work for the Dearborn Stove Company.

==Career==
In January 1950, Tippit enrolled in a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] vocational training school at [[Bogata, Texas]].

At the time of his death, Tippit was assigned to Dallas Police vehicle #10, had badge #848 and was earning a salary of $490 a month (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|490|1963}}}} in 2015) as a Dallas police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/jfk50/reflect/20131102-for-slain-officer-j.d.-tippits-family-normal-life-gone-in-a-flash.ece|title=For slain officer J.D.

On November 22, 1963, J.D. Tippit was working beat number 78, his normal patrol area in south [[Oak Cliff]], a residential area of Dallas.&lt;ref name="WCR-C4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

At 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., 15 minutes after Kennedy was shot, Tippit received a radio order to drive to the central Oak Cliff area as part of a concentration of police around the center of the city. At 12:54, Tippit radioed that he had moved as directed. By then several messages had been broadcast describing a suspect in the killing of Kennedy&lt;ref name="WCR-C1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

At approximately 1:11–1:14&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="tapes"&gt;The [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/dpdtapes/tapes2.htm first report of Tippit's shooting] was transmitted over Police Channel 1 some time between 1:16 and 1:19 p.m., as indicated by verbal time stamps made periodically by the dispatcher. Specifically, the first report began 1 minute 41 seconds after the 1:16 time stamp. Before that, witness Domingo Benavides could be heard unsuccessfully trying to use Tippit's police radio microphone, beginning at 1:16. Dale K. Myers, ''With Malice: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Murder of Officer J.D. Tippit'', 1998, p. 384. {{ISBN|0-9662709-7-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tippit was driving slowly eastward on East 10th Street — about {{convert|100|ft|m}} past the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue — when he pulled alongside a man who resembled the police description.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald was {{convert|5|ft|9|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|150|lb|kg}}.

One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.&lt;ref name="deathlocation"/&gt;

A short time later, Hardy's shoe store manager Johnny Brewer observed Oswald acting suspiciously as police cars passed nearby with sirens blaring. Oswald then ducked into the [[Texas Theatre]] without purchasing a ticket. The police were notified by the theater's cashier and responded by surrounding the theater. Oswald was arrested after a brief struggle.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 1|1964|pp=7-8}}

Twelve people who witnessed the shooting{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=166}} or its aftermath were mentioned in The Warren Report.&lt;ref&gt;By the evening of November 22, five of them (Helen Markham, Barbara Davis, Virginia Davis, Ted Callaway, Sam Guinyard) had identified Lee Harvey Oswald in police lineups as the man they saw. A sixth (William Scoggins) did so the next day. Three others (Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, Warren Reynolds) subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph. Two witnesses (Domingo Benavides, William Smith) testified that Oswald resembled the man they had seen. One witness (L.J. Lewis) felt he was too distant from the gunman to make a positive identification. Warren Commission Hearings, CE 1968, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0425a.htm Location of Eyewitnesses to the Movements of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Vicinity of the Tippit Killing].&lt;/ref&gt; Domingo Benavides saw Tippit standing by the left door of his parked police car, and a man standing on the right side of the car. He then heard shots and saw Tippit fall to the ground. Benavides stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of the street from Tippit's car. He observed the shooter fleeing the scene and removing spent cartridge cases from his gun as he left.

Benavides waited in his truck until the gunman disappeared before assisting Tippit. He then reported the shooting to police headquarters, using the radio in Tippit's car.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0227b.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides].&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Markham witnessed the shooting and then saw a man with a gun in his hand leave the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 305, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0157a.htm Testimony of Mrs. Helen Markham].&lt;/ref&gt; Markham identified [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] as Tippit's killer in a police lineup she viewed that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 318, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0163b.htm Testimony of Helen Markham].&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Davis and her sister-in-law Virginia Davis heard the shots and saw a man crossing their lawn, shaking his revolver, as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later, the women found two cartridge cases near the crime scene and handed the cases over to police.

That evening, Barbara Davis and Virginia Davis were taken to a lineup and both Davises picked out Oswald as the man whom they had seen.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 342, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0175b.htm Testimony of Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis].

Taxicab driver William Scoggins testified that he was sitting nearby in his cab when he saw Tippit's police car pull up alongside a man on the sidewalk. Scoggins heard three or four shots and then saw Tippit fall to the ground. As Scoggins crouched behind his cab, the man passed within twelve feet of him, pistol in hand, muttering what sounded to him like, "poor dumb cop" or "poor damn cop."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 322–27, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0165b.htm Testimony of William W. Scoggins].&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Scoggins viewed a police lineup and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen with the pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Scott P. |title=The Faces of Lee Harvey Oswald: The Evolution of an Alleged Assassin |year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-8682-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission also named several other witnesses&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Report, pp. 166–169. Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 817, CE 1968, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0425a.htm Location of eyewitnesses to the movements of Lee Harvey Oswald in the vicinity of the Tippit killing].&lt;/ref&gt; who were not at the scene of the murder, but who identified Oswald running between the murder scene and the [[Texas Theatre]], where Oswald was subsequently arrested.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 1|1964|p=8}} Four cartridge cases were found at the scene by eyewitnesses.

It was the unanimous testimony of expert witnesses before the Warren Commission that these spent cartridge cases were fired from the revolver in Oswald's possession to the exclusion of all other weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Report, Appendix 10: Expert Testimony, [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-10.html#revcar Revolver Cartridges and Cartridge Cases].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrest and during subsequent questionings by police, Lee Harvey Oswald denied any involvement in Tippit's murder. Based on eyewitness' statements and the gun found in Oswald's possession at the time of his arrest, he was formally charged with the murder of J.D. Tippit at 7:10 pm. on November 22. During the course of the day, police began to suspect that Oswald was also involved in the shooting of President Kennedy.

At approximately 1:00 am on November 23, Oswald was also charged with assassinating President John F. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Warren Commission|first=|title=The Warren Commission Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpzGMAmH2LEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=jd+tippit+lee+harvey+oswald+denied&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_NHtU-j6D6Sg8AGYkICwAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jd%20tippit%20lee%20harvey%20oswald%20denied&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=0-7607-4997-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald continued to maintain his innocence in connection with both murders. In the late morning of November 24, while being transported from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas County Jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the abdomen by Dallas nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]]. The shooting was broadcast throughout the United States and Canada on [[live television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siracusa, Ph.D.|first=Joseph M. |title=Encyclopedia of the Kennedys: The People and Events That Shaped America|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-539-X|page=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Oswald was killed before he was tried for either crime, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] commissioned a committee of U.S. Senators, Congressmen and elder statesmen to investigate the events surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy, Officer Tippit and Oswald in an effort to answer questions surrounding the events.&lt;ref name=rivera&gt;{{cite book|last=Rivera|first=Sheila |title=Assassination of John F.

The committee, known as the [[Warren Commission]] (named for the commission chairman, Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]), spent ten months investigating the murders and interviewing witnesses.&lt;ref name=rivera/&gt; On September 24, 1964, the Warren Commission released an 888-page report that concluded there was no evidence of a conspiracy and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=William Thaddeus |others=Bliss, Donald T.|title=Counsel for the Situation: Shaping the Law to Realize America's Promise|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-0494-1|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=Willard |last2=Marion|first2=Nancy E.|title=Killing the President: Assassinations, Attempts, and Rumored Attempts on U.S. Commanders-in-Chief|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0-313-36475-3|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Peter|title=The Kennedy Assassination|year=2007|publisher=Univ.

In 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] reported: "Based on Oswald's possession of the murder weapon a short time after the murder and the eyewitness identifications of Oswald as the gunman, the committee concluded that Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippit."&lt;ref name="HCSA-IA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=59 |chapter=I.A.5.

===Conspiracy theories===
{{Main|John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories}}
Some conspiracy theorists have alleged that the murder of Officer Tippit was part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. Implying that two murders could not have happened so closely together by coincidence, his killing is often referred to as the "[[Rosetta Stone]]" to the solution of the Kennedy assassination by critics of the official findings.&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite book|last=McAdams|first=John|title=JFK Assassination Logic: How to Think About Claims of Conspiracy|year=2011|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9781597974899|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OJeNytAOZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 8, 2013|page=175|chapter=Not All Evidence Is Equal: Using Reliable Evidence|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OJeNytAOZkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi 2007 p.816&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics dispute that Oswald shot Tippit, arguing that the physical evidence and witness testimony do not support that conclusion.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=James D. |authorlink= |url=http://cha3u.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/45668088/Conspiracy%20Theories%20in%20American%20History%20%282003%29.pdf |title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia |editor1-first=Knight |editor1-last=Peter |year=2003 |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=1-57607-812-4 |page=391 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics state that Tippit himself was a conspirator, tasked to kill Oswald by organized crime or right-wing politicians in order to cover up the search for other assassins.&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonokowski"&gt;{{cite news |title=JFK's magic lives on&amp;nbsp;... and some called it Camelot's Court |last=Bonokoski |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Bonokoski |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WpdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TDQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4533%2C2089418 |newspaper=The Windsor Star |location=Windsor, Ontario, |date=November 22, 1973 |page=39 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of the assassination, both Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the new President, [[Lyndon B.

In January 1964, Tippit was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor from the [[American Police Hall of Fame &amp; Museum|American Police Hall of Fame]], and he also received the Police Medal of Honor, the Police Cross, and the Citizens Traffic Commission Award of Heroism. A state historical marker to Officer Tippit was unveiled November 20, 2012 at the location where the shooting occurred.&lt;ref name="nbcnews1"/&gt;

Tippit's widow married Dallas police lieutenant Harry Dean Thomas in January 1967. They were married until his death in 1982.

The '''Kamwina Nsapu rebellion''', also spelled '''Kamuina Nsapu rebellion''',&lt;ref name=reuters0317/&gt; is an ongoing rebellion instigated by the Kamwina Nsapu militia against state security forces&lt;ref name=ibtimes0317&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/drcs-kasai-oriental-province-requires-emergency-assistance-600000-says-un-1610359|title=DRC's Kasai-Oriental province requires emergency assistance 600,000 says UN|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=10 March 2017|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), in the provinces of [[Kasaï-Central]], [[Kasaï Province|Kasaï]], [[Kasai-Oriental]], [[Lomami Province|Lomami]] and [[Sankuru]].&lt;ref name=irinnews0817/&gt;&lt;ref name=allafrica0317&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201703220739.html|title=Congo-Kinshasa: Kamuina Nsapu Insurgency Adds to Dangers in DR Congo|publisher=All Africa|accessdate=28 March 2017|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting began after the militia, led by Kamwina Nsapu, attacked security forces in August 2016.

There is an ethnic nature to the conflict,&lt;ref name=reuters0317/&gt; with the militia being [[Luba people|Luba]].&lt;ref name=ibtimes0317/&gt; It had selectively killed non-Luba.&lt;ref name=aje0317/&gt;

==Background==
In 2011, Jean-Pierre Mpandi was designated to succeed his uncle and become the sixth head of Bajila Kasanja clan after returning from South Africa&lt;ref name=irinnews0817&gt;{{cite news|title= Briefing: The conflict in Kasai, DRC|url=http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2017/07/31/briefing-conflict-kasai-drc|accessdate=8 August 2017|work=Irinnews|date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a conviction in a diamond-trafficking case. His tribal name was Kamwina Nsapu, meaning "black ant". Such chiefs exercise significant control over land and are required to be recognized by the central state even if they are selected according to traditions. That encourages chiefs to support the [[DRC government]] to get its endorsement.&lt;ref name=irinnews0817/&gt;

His region supported the opposition in the last presidential election, and tensions flared when the government appointed supporters, rather than tribal chiefs, to powerful positions in the local government.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR Congo tribal rebellion: What we know|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1449984/dr-congo-tribal-rebellion|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=New Vision|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government also refused to recognise Kamwina Nsapu's appointment as chief after he opposed the government's stance. That led him to contest the central government's power, and he began calling for an insurrection in June 2016.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radiolechefkasai"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kasaï-Central: le chef Kamwina Nsapu est mort dans les combats contre les forces de l’ordre|url=http://www.radiookapi.net/2016/08/13/actualite/securite/kasai-central-le-chef-kamwina-nsapu-est-mort-dans-les-combats-contre|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Radio Okapi|date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of rebellion==
He incited his men with xenophobic language, referring to the regular security forces as foreign mercenaries and an occupation force.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt; He caused a militia, named after him, to launch attacks on the local police.&lt;ref name="radiolechefkasai" /&gt; On 12 August 2016, he was killed alongside eight other militiamen and 11 policemen in [[Tshimbulu]].&lt;ref name="affrontementsmeurtriersatshimbuludansle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20160814-rdc-tshimbulu-affrontements-meurtriers-kasai-central|title=RDC: affrontements meurtriers à Tshimbulu, dans le Kasaï-Central|publisher=[[Radio France Internationale]]|date=14 August 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death, the Congolese Observatory for Human Rights condemned his killing and suggested he should have been arrested instead.&lt;ref name="radiolocdhcondamne"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kasaï-Central: l’OCDH condamne la mort du chef milicien Kamwina Nsapu|url=http://www.radiookapi.net/2016/08/13/actualite/securite/kasai-central-locdh-condamne-la-mort-du-chef-milicien-kamwina-nsapu|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Radio Okapi|date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of his followers refused to believe that he was dead and escalated the violence by intensifying their attacks on the security forces.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt; As the violence by Kamwina Nsapu's men escalated, the uprising spread, and an increasing number of locals picked up arms against the government. Kamwina Nsapu's death meant that the rebellion effectively fractured into numerous movements, "all fighting for different reasons".&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt;

==After Kamwina Nsapu's death==
In September 2016, Kawina Nsapu's militia captured an area 180&amp;nbsp;km from [[Kananga]] and then captured the [[Kananga Airport]] before it was retaken by the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="radioanalysedelattaque"&gt;{{cite news|title=Analyse de l’attaque de l’aéroport de Kananga par la milice de Kamwin-Nsapu|url=http://www.radiookapi.net/2016/09/26/emissions/dialogue-entre-congolais/analyse-de-lattaque-de-laeroport-de-kananga-par-la|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Radio Okapi|date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 2016, the government announced that in total, 49 people had been killed (27 militiamen, 16 policemen and 6 civilians) and 185 militiamen captured since the fighting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiookapi.net/2016/09/26/actualite/securite/kananga-49-morts-dans-les-accrochages-entre-forces-de-lordre-et|title=Kananga: 49 morts dans les accrochages entre forces de l’ordre et miliciens|publisher=[[Radio Okapi]]|date=26 September 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, four militiamen were killed, and two policemen were wounded.&lt;ref name="africanewsaumoinsquatremorts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Au moins quatre morts dans des violences à Kananga, dans le centre de la RDC|url=http://fr.africanews.com/2017/01/28/au-moins-quatre-morts-dans-des-violences-a-kananga-dans-le-centre-de-la-rdc/|accessdate=20 February 2017|work=Africanews|date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the rebels called for the removal of the governor, Alex Kande, and protested the visit of Prime Minister [[Samy Badibanga]].&lt;ref name="africanewsaumoinsquatremorts"/&gt; On 31 January 2017, a Roman Catholic priest from St. Alphonsus Parish in [[Kananga]] who tried to stop the militia from taking children from schools was kidnapped but was later released.&lt;ref name="vaticanapriestwhoopposed"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFRICA/DR CONGO - A priest who opposed the militiamen of Kamuina Nsapu was kidnapped and then released|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/africadr-congo-a-priest-who-opposed-the-militiamen|website=Vatican.va|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February 2017, fighting erupted in Tshimbulu between 300 militiamen and the armed forces in a reprisal attack by the militia. At least six people were killed, including one civilian. By the next day, 60 to 75 were reported killed by the armed forces, while at least two servicemen have been wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20170210-rdc-decompte-macabre-kasai-central|title=En RDC, nouveau décompte macabre en cours dans le Kasaï central|publisher=[[Radio France Internationale]]|date=10 February 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February, United Nations human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell announced that at least 101 people had been killed by government forces between 9 and 13 February, with 39 women confirmed to be among them.&lt;ref name="reuterscongolesesoldierskillat least101"&gt;{{cite news|title=Congolese soldiers kill at least 101 in militia clashes - U.N.|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-congo-violence-un-idUKKBN15T17W|accessdate=20 February 2017|work=Reuters|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the clashes, many parents have stopped sending their children to school.&lt;ref name="radioapreslapsychose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Après la psychose de Kamwina Nsapu, les élèves du Kasaï-Central appelés à reprendre les cours|url=http://www.radiookapi.net/2017/02/26/actualite/securite/apres-la-psychose-de-kamwina-nsapu-les-eleves-du-kasai-central-appeles |accessdate=February 27, 2017|work=Radio Okapi|date=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 26 February 2017, Justin Milonga, the vice governor of Kasaï-Central, said that the "insanity" needed to end and that children should resume going to school.&lt;ref name="radioapreslapsychose" /&gt;

On 15 April 2017, the government returned the body of Kamwina Nsapu to the militia, one of its key demands, as a way of easing tensions and recognised his successor, Jacques Kabeya Ntumba, as a customary chief, as failure to recognize Nsapu had been a trigger for the fighting.&lt;ref name=reuters0317&gt;{{cite news|title=Congo government returns tribal leader's body to sooth Kasai tensions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-violence-idUSKBN17I0UV|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=Reuters|date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the conflict continued to spread and escalate in violence, the government sent hardened troops from eastern Congo to fight the Kamwina Nsapu militia. The commanders of these reinforcements were "notorious for their brutality" and even included a former [[warlord]] who had once been convicted by the government to death for his extreme behavior. Increasing reports surfaced of the military having massacred both captured rebels and Luba civilians who were suspected of supporting the insurgency.&lt;ref name="who in graves" /&gt; MONUSCO estimated that Congolese "state agents" had carried out 1,176 extrajudicial killings against protesters and anti-government activists in 2017, and that most of these killings occurred in areas affected by the Kamwina Nsapu rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/congo-state-agents-murdered-hundreds-in-2017-says-un-report |title=Congo 'state agents' murdered hundreds in 2017, says UN report |author=Jason Burke |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 January 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2018, the government had retaken most of the areas in Kasaï and the surrounding regions which had previously been held by insurgents. Nevertheless, fighting continued and a new surge of violence in February 2018 caused about 11,000 people in Kasaï to flee their homes.&lt;ref name="Threaten New"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-republic-of-congo-kasai-crisis/4282770.html |title=Mounting Inter-Ethnic Tensions in DRC's Kasai Region Threaten New Violence |author=Lisa Schlein |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=6 March 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimated that about 5,000 people had been killed overall during the fighting by August 2018, though the violence did "still fall short of genocide".&lt;ref name="genocide"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/un-investigator-atrocities-in-drc-fall-short-of-genocide/4512694.html |title=UN Investigator: Atrocities in DRC Fall Short of Genocide  |author=William Eagle |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=3 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Militia == 
The Kamwina Nsapu rebels are only loosely connected and operate in various autonomous factions.&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; They lack an "identifiable leader" since Kamwina Nsapu's death,&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters0317 /&gt; but individual factions are known to have leaders such as "General" Gaylord Tshimbala&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; and opposition politicians are rumoured to support the uprising.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters0317 /&gt; The rebels are united in their opposition against the government&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; and have adopted red as unifiying colour of their uprising.&lt;ref name="who in graves" /&gt; Kamwina Nsapu fighters thus usually identify themselves by wearing red headbands or armbands.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;

Although relatively poorly armed, with most of their weaponry looted or stolen from the Congolese security forces,&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt; the rebels are strongly motivated by their belief in various forms of [[witchcraft]]:&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; Many Kamwina Nsapu rebels believe in gaining magical protection from harm&lt;ref name="who in graves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; by wearing [[Fetishism|fetishes]],&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; specific leaves,&lt;ref name="nytimeslooktheyaredyingvideo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettleman|first1=Jeffrey|title=Look, They Are Dying’: Video Appears to Show Massacre by Congolese Soldiers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/world/africa/democratic-republic-congo-massacre-video-.html|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=The New York Times|date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt; and protective [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt; Elements of the Kamwina Nsapu militia have been described as "cultlike" due to their beliefs. For example, recruits are reportedly forced to walk through fire and told that by undergoing the initiation ritual, they will be [[resurrection|resurrected]] if they are killed in battle.&lt;ref name="who in graves" /&gt; Some fighters also believe that wooden weapons can be transformed into functioning guns by magical rituals.&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt;

The militia has also been noted for its extensive recruitment of [[child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|child soldiers]]. Experts consider it likely that most of the rebels are children.&lt;ref name="affrontementsmeurtriersatshimbuludansle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who in graves" /&gt; Child soldiers are promised jobs and money and are often given drugs and alcohol in order to motivate them to fight.&lt;ref name="who in graves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt;

Its splintered nature causes the rebellion to have no clear goals.&lt;ref name="voodoo" /&gt; Common demands by members of the militia are, however, the return of and the proper burial of their slain leader, which the government conceded in March or April 2017,&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters0317 /&gt; reparations for the chief's family, the restoration of damaged hospitals and schools by the central authorities, "social and economic development of the region" and the release of imprisoned rebels as well as civilians. Since February 2017, a purported spokesman of the group has also demanded the implementation of the agreement between Kabila and the opposition after the [[December 2016 Congolese protests]].&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt;

==Atrocities==
===Ethnic cleansing===
The conflict has evolved from a rebellion against the state to involve ethnic violence.&lt;ref name=irinnews0817/&gt; Most of the people in the Kamwina Nsapu militia are from the [[Luba people]]&lt;ref name=ibtimes0317/&gt; and are reportedly targeting the [[Pende people|Pende]] and the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]].&lt;ref name=irinnews0817/&gt; On 24 March 2017, militiamen reportedly killed and decapitated at least 40 policemen and spared six, who spoke the local [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba language]].&lt;ref name=aje0317&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/kamwina-nsapu-militia-kill-40-policemen-dr-congo-170325181319668.html|title=Kamwina Nsapu militia kill 40 policemen in DR Congo|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2017/03/40-police-officers-decapitated-in-democratic-republic-of-congo-attack.html|title=DR Congo: 40 police officers decapitated by militia|publisher=Newshub|date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bana Mura militia, a largely-[[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] group, committed a string of ethnically-motivated attacks against the [[Luba people|Luba]] and [[Lulua people|Lulua]]. It has been linked to the government and victims attest that the army and police accompanied it in attacks.&lt;ref name=irinnews0817/&gt; It was reported to have committed atrocities such as cutting off toddlers' limbs, stabbing pregnant women and mutilating fetuses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/congo-violence-fuels-fears-of-return-to-90s-bloodbath|title=Congo's violence fuels fears of return to 90s bloodbath|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 July 2017|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is blamed for the murder of 49 minors in 2017.&lt;ref name="un 251" /&gt;

===Child soldiers===
Reportedly, half the Kamwina Nsapu militia is under 14,&lt;ref name="affrontementsmeurtriersatshimbuludansle"/&gt; with some being as young as 5,&lt;ref name="adds dangers" /&gt; and Congolese authorities claim that it is under the influence of drugs.&lt;ref name="affrontementsmeurtriersatshimbuludansle"/&gt;

==Casualties==
In June 2017, more than 3,300 people have been killed in violence since October 2016 and 20 villages have been completely destroyed, half of them by government troops, according to the [[Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40344115|title=DR Congo Kasai conflict: 'Thousands dead' in violence|publisher=BBC News|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="un 251" /&gt;

==International reactions==
[[File:Le DSRSG David Gressly échange avec les journalistes à la suite de sa visite à Kananga.jpg|thumb|UN Deputy Special Representative [[David Gressly]] speaks with the press after meeting with MONUSCO and Congolese officials to discuss the conflict.]]
On 11 February 2017, the [[United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (MONUSCO) said in a statement that it was "concerned about the persistent conflict in the Kasais".&lt;ref name="monuscostronglycondemns"&gt;{{cite web|title=MONUSCO STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE PERSISTENT VIOLENCE IN THE KASAI PROVINCES|url=https://monusco.unmissions.org/en/monusco-strongly-condemns-persistent-violence-kasai-provinces|website=MONUSCO|accessdate=20 February 2017|date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It condemned the "recruitment and use of child soldiers" and "the disproportionate use of force" by the Congolese forces in retaliation.&lt;ref name="monuscostronglycondemns"/&gt;

In his [[angelus]] on 16 February 2017, [[Pope Francis]] called for an end to the violence, especially the use of child soldiers.&lt;ref name="africanewsdrcongopopefranciscalls"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boh|first1=Elvis|title=DR Congo: Pope Francis calls for peace|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/02/19/dr-congo-pope-francis-calls-for-peace/|accessdate=20 February 2017|work=Africanews|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicheraldpopelamentsplightofchildsoldiers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope laments plight of child soldiers fighting in Congo|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/20/pope-laments-plight-of-child-soldiers-fighting-in-congo/|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Catholic Herald|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "I suffer deeply for the victims, especially for so many children ripped from their families and their schools to be used as soldiers."&lt;ref name="vaticanradiopopepraysfor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope prays for victims of violence in DR Congo and Pakistan|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/02/19/pope_prays_for_victims_of_violence_in_dr_congo_and_pakistan/1293587|accessdate=20 February 2017|work=Vatican Radio|date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2017, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson of the [[US Department of State]] called for an investigation into the video of the alleged Mwanza Lomba massacre.&lt;ref name="lemondemassacrefilmedukasai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voiceofamericausdemandsindependentprobe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ken|title=US Demands Independent Probe of Alleged Civilian Massacre in DRC|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/us-demands-independent-probe-of-alleged-civilian-massacre-in-drc/3733011.html|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Voice of America|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2017, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development]] also called for an investigation into the video.&lt;ref name="lacroixvideodemassacresouspression"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vidéo de massacre: sous pression, la RDC refuse d'enquêter|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Monde/Video-massacre-sous-pression-RDC-refuse-enqueter-2017-02-20-1300826280|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=La Croix|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfifrancecallsondrctoshedlight"&gt;{{cite news|title=France calls on DRC to shed light on massacre video|url=http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20170220-france-calls-drc-shed-light-massacre-video|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=Radio France International|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an official statement, it said, "France condemns the bloody violence which has rocked the Kasai region for several months. It calls on the Congolese authorities and security forces to shoulder their primary responsibility to protect civilians, fully respecting human rights".&lt;ref name="frenchministrystatement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Democratic Republic of Congo - Situation in the Kasai region|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/events/article/democratic-republic-of-congo-situation-in-the-kasai-region-20-02-17|website=French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development|accessdate=21 February 2017|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2017, two UN investigators were murdered in Kasai, with both the Congolese government and the Kamunia Nsapu militia naming each other as the culprits. A video published by the Congolese government on April 24 seems to point to the militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/24/un-experts-killed-congo-video-michael-sharp-zaida-catalan |title=UN 'utterly horrified' by video appearing to show murder of two experts in Congo &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Løvejagten''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] for ''"the lion hunt"'', English title: ''The Lion Hunt'') was a controversial [[1907 in film|1907]] silent film by [[Denmark|Danish]] producer [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]] and director [[Viggo Larsen]]. The short ten-minute movie caused an enormous public protest in [[Denmark]] because it depicted the actual shooting of two captive lions.&lt;ref name="when"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Two big game hunters are on safari in the jungle with their African guide. They observe zebras, ostrich and a hippopotamus, and catch a small monkey for a pet. During the night they are awakened by a lion which kills a small goat and then the hunters' horse. The hunters shoot the lion as it stands by the water on a beach. They discover another lion and shoot it also. The lions are gutted and skinned. The happy hunters sit and smoke cigarettes afterward.

==Production and controversy==
The ten-minute "jungle" movie (215 meters of 35mm film) was actually filmed [[Filming location|on location]] in Denmark. Scenes of the hunters in the forest were shot in [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]] park near Copenhagen. The animals were filmed at the [[Copenhagen Zoo]] with the camera aimed downward to avoid any view of the enclosures. The controversial shooting of two lions took place on the small island of [[Elleore]] in the [[Roskilde fjord]].&lt;ref&gt;Casper Tyberg, "Teltholdernes verdensteater 1896-1909", ''100 Års Danske Film'', Rosinante, 2001, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1907, Ole Olsen decorated Elleore with palm fronds and artificial plants to simulate a [[tropical savanna]]. He then bought two elderly lions from the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck|Hagenbeck Zoo]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany for the large sum of 5000 deutschmarks.&lt;ref name="larsen"&gt;Larsen, Lisbeth Richter, ''World Record Nordisk Film Centenary'', Film #50, May 2006, retrieved=2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt;
When the Danish [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] learned about Olsen's plan to shoot the lions for his movie, they protested to the [[Danish Minister of Justice]] [[Peter Adler Alberti]].&lt;ref name="when"&gt;{{cite web

}} &lt;/ref&gt; Alberti banned the filming. Two days later, however, Olsen defiantly shot the scenes as planned, then smuggled the film to Sweden. Olsen's cinematographer, [[Axel Graatkjær]], was arrested and spent a day in jail. At a court hearing, Alberti banned the movie in Denmark and revoked Olsen's license for his Biograf Theater.&lt;ref name="kommentar"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1907, Olsen premiered ''The Lion Hunt'' in Sweden. Because of the publicity from the protests, ''Løvejagten'' was a huge success abroad. The following year, after the charges of animal cruelty were dropped and the Danish ban was rescinded, the film had its homeland premiere on November 11, 1908.&lt;ref name="when"/&gt; [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk Film Kompagni]] eventually sold 259 prints of ''Løvejagten'', which earned the company an enormous profit. It ushered in the "[[Cinema of Denmark|golden age]]" of Danish cinema when Nordisk Film became the most productive film company in Europe.&lt;ref name="kommentar"/&gt;
A sequel to the film, ''Bear Hunting in Russia'', was shot in 1909 and was also a profitable movie, eventually selling 118 prints.&lt;ref name="larsen"/&gt;

==Cast and crew==
[[Viggo Larsen]] directed the filming as well as acted as one of the hunters. Knud Lumbye portrayed the second hunter and William Thomsen played the African guide. [[Axel Graatkjær]], who later became a favorite cinematographer of [[August Blom]] and [[Urban Gad]], shot the film, credited under his actual name of A. Sørensen.

[[Image:In Nacht und Eis.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''In Nacht und Eis'', directed by Mime Misu.]]
'''Mime Misu''' (b. 21 January 1888 - 1953)&lt;ref name=KinoTV&gt;[http://www.kinotv.com/page/bio_cpl.php?namecode=120468&amp;l=it "Mime Misu"]. KinoTV.com. Accessed 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; (born '''Mișu Rosescu''') was a [[Romania]]n ballet dancer, pantomime artist, film actor and director. In 1912 he wrote and directed the first feature film about the sinking of the  {{RMS|Titanic||6}}, ''[[In Nacht und Eis]]'', released in August 1912 four months after the disaster.

==Early acting life==
Mime Misu&lt;ref group=n&gt;His name is pronounced 'Meema Mischu' in Romanian.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the market town of [[Botoșani]], [[Romania]], into a family of artistes. He was the nephew of the 'world famous' Rahel. He was on the stage from an early age in ballet and pantomime, and he displayed enough talent to be given a free place at [[Bucharest National University of Arts|Bucharest Art Academy]]. During his studies he was assigned to the [[National Theatre Bucharest|Royal National Theatre]], and after graduating with honors he successfully played in provincial theatres in Romania. In 1900 he performed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 World Fair]] in Paris, and then took his own productions to Berlin, Vienna, Budapest and London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmuniversitaet.de/de/universittsbibliothek/veroeffentlichungen/mime-misu/mime3.html Mime Misu - Der Regisseur des ersten "Titanic-Films', page 3]. Universität Babelsberg Konrad Wolf, (in German), citing ''Licht-Bild-Bühne'', 03.01.1914 (in German).&lt;!--German date format--&gt; Accessed 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film director==
Misu worked for the film production companies [[Lux]] and [[Pathé Frères]] in Paris before signing up with [[Continental-Kunstfilm]] of Berlin in 1912 where he wrote and directed three films: ''Das Gespenst von Clyde'', ''[[In Nacht und Eis]]'', and ''[[Das Mirakel (1912 film)|Das Mirakel]]''.&lt;ref name=KinoTV /&gt; Misu made one more film in Germany, ''Der Excentric-Club'' for Projektions-AG Union (PAGU).&lt;ref name=KinoTV /&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;The producer was [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203452/ Paul Davidson], who also produced the film of the [[Karl Vollmoeller]]/[[Max Reinhardt]] pantomime ''Eine venezianische Nacht'' (1914); Paul Leni's ''Dornröschen'' (1917); Paul Wegener's ''Der Rattenfänger von Hameln'' (1918) (must find?); [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s ''Madame DuBarry'' (1919) with [[Emil Jannings]] and [[Pola Negri]], and ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem, wie er in der Welt kam]]'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the Berlin journal ''Licht-Bild-Bühne'' in 1914 called him the 'Napoleon of film' (de:'Napoleon der Filmkunst'), referring to his various technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;''Licht-Bild-Bühne'', 1 March 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Emil Schunemann]] (the cameraman for ''In Nacht und Eis'' and ''Das Mirakel'') called him a barber in his memoirs, he wasn't being particularly complimentary.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Misu went to the USA but only made one known film with his Misu-Film Co., ''The Money God''.{{sfn|Abel|2005|pp=627}}&lt;ref&gt;1914 dreht Mime Misu bei Metropolitan Film Co., in den USA, seinen letzten uns heute bekannten Film ''The Money God". Als Linzenzdatum wird hier der 10.2.1914 mit der Nummer 2118 angegeben. See ''Filmblatt 9'', in German (find full ref!!)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 he directed ''Ontmaskerd'' ('Unmasked') in the Netherlands under his real name, Misu Rosescu. Like ''[[In Nacht und Eis]]'', this film also contains a scene of a ship sinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmuniversitaet.de/de/universittsbibliothek/veroeffentlichungen/mime-misu  Mime Misu - Der Regisseur des ersten "Titanic-Films', page 1].

Binger.{{harvnb|Donaldson|1997|pp=138–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misu travelled to the US every year from 1915-1917.&lt;ref group=n&gt;Misu's transatlantic voyages:
* Arrived in the US on 27 October 1915 aboard the [[Frederik VIII]] from Copenhagen.

* 1 February 1917 on the [[Noordam]] from Rotterdam.

In 1920/21 Misugraph-Film G.m.b.H., had its offices at Martin-Luther-Straße 28, Berlin, according to the Reichs-Kino-Adressbuch.

In 1921 Misu seems to have misrepresented himself as to his level of involvement at [[Famous Players Lasky]], and to have caused some considerable offence. This led to an exchange of letters in the Berlin film journal ''Film-Kurier''.{{refn| group=n|(Adapted from a machine translation from German.) Misugraph Film Co.&lt;br&gt;
The Misugraph-Film Co., of New York and Berlin, is obliged by appearing in a local magazine article, and asks ask us to publish the following information on their foundation and plans:&lt;br&gt;
Our company, which was established from the very beginning on the participation of American circles could never be addressed as a smaller company in Berlin. The often mentioned Frankfurt foundation is not in the pipeline, but has long been a fact and is only one part of our complex yet growing organization. Our artistic director, Mr. Misu was the last years in America and had international success garnered back to a time "Miracle" movie - ["Das Marienwunder" is probably meant - website Ed.] "Titanic disaster", as the German film industry was barely able to fly. Doubters regarding business performance seems the personality of our commercial manager, Mr Giesen to be unknown. The economical and professional way just our operations (including abolition of the directors / system) has all chances for themselves. In addition, we leave the final argument confidently our upcoming production onset.&lt;ref name=UKBW_2&gt;[http://www.hff-potsdam.de/de/bibliothek-mediathek/veroeffentlichungen/mime-misu/mime2.html Mime Misu - Der Regisseur des ersten "Titanic-Films', page 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328030954/http://www.hff-potsdam.de/de/bibliothek-mediathek/veroeffentlichungen/mime-misu/mime2.html |date=2013-03-28 }}.

A group of employees of the company ([[Famous Players Lasky]]) which is deemed damaged by Misugraph-Film informs us with the following facts in assessment of the situation, which are intended to limit the spread of rumours concerning the Company's true value:&lt;br&gt;
# To safeguard their damaged interests, their Counsel (Attorney Dr. Freudenstein, French Strasse 52) is engaged in establishing an "Association for the protection of the victim of Misugraph Film Co." 
# Herr Direktor Misu spread rumors that he was previously the artistic and technical director of the Famous Players Lasky Co., New York. was equivalent. In consultation with the directors of the latter company, Eugene Zukor [son of [[Adolph Zukor]]] and Herr Nachman (currently staying in Berlin), this is non-factual. Misu is not known at all to Mr. Zukor, while Mr. Nachman knows him only as a buyer of the company. Nothing is known of productions which he claims to have passed to them.
# As for the management, then the aforementioned Protection Association, the material of almost all employees, artists and suppliers who have come into contact with the company, has to a great extent, have to give the required response.
# His rejection of the term "minor Berlin company" is considered invalid, even if some American circles should be involved, since the company in one-and-a-quarter years of its existence has not turned a single foot of film. Also, the number of employees (office, directors, artists, craftsmen) has been so minimal that this term is fully justified.&lt;ref name=UKBW_2 /&gt; }}

Information about his later career and death is uncertain.

==Selected filmography==
He directed at least six films:
* ''Das Gespenst von Clyde'' (1912)&lt;ref&gt;Registered with Berlin censor 19 June 1912. There seems to be little information about this film.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[In Nacht und Eis]]'' (1912)&lt;ref&gt;Registered with Berlin censor 6 July 1912, fp Berlin 17 August 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; (and also possibly played the part of the radio operator)

'''Reyna Angélica Marroquín''' (1941–1969) was a [[Salvadoran]] woman who was murdered in the [[United States]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; Marroquín's murder was not discovered until 1999, 30 years after its occurrence, when her body was found in the former [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]], [[New York (state)|New York]] home of Howard B. Elkins, a businessman who was identified as the prime suspect. Elkins committed [[suicide]] before he could be charged or thoroughly questioned.

==Crime==
On September 2, 1999, an old [[55-gallon drum]] in the [[crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of a house in [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]], [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], was found to contain the [[mummified]] remains of a pregnant [[Hispanic]] female in her late 20s between 145 and 152 cm (4'9" and 5'0") tall, with unusual dental work.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; The cause of death was determined to be [[blunt force trauma]] to the head. The drum also contained [[polystyrene]] pellets, two rings (one inscribed "M.H.R."), a [[locket]] inscribed "To Patrice Love Uncle Phil", green [[dye]], and an address book.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Broken Trust |access-date=July 9, 2018 |series=[[The New Detectives]] |date=November 13, 2004 |season=9 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eGUXZg2bAk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drum had been made in 1965 and used for transporting dye, with markings showing it had been shipped to Melrose Plastics, a synthetic flower company partly owned by Howard B. Elkins, a local businessman who had owned the Jericho house until 1972, when he sold the plastic business and moved to [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], with his wife.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref name=in/&gt;&lt;ref name=is/&gt;&lt;ref name=affair/&gt; Under [[infrared]] light some of the deteriorated address book was legible.&lt;ref name=FDM&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Flower Drum Murder|date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=July 9, 2018 |series=Murder Book |network=Investigation Discovery |season=2 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4981464/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Permanent residence (United States)|alien card number]] written on the first page belonged to Reyna Angélica Marroquín, a 28-year-old immigrant from [[El Salvador]], who had worked as a [[nanny]], and for a manufacturer of synthetic flowers at a factory on East 34th Street, [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=FDM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman In Barrel Id'd 30-year-old Murder Mystery |author=Robert Gearty and Corky Siemazsko |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-09-30/news/18121971_1_detectives-howard-elkins-address-book |newspaper=NY Daily News |date=September 30, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phone number in the book belonged to Kathy Andrade, who had been a friend of Marroquín. When contacted, Andrade told the police that Marroquín had been having an [[extramarital affair]] with Elkins, but had called Andrade to say she had become afraid of him after telling Elkins' wife about the affair.&lt;ref name=adds/&gt;&lt;ref name=affair/&gt;&lt;ref name=FDM/&gt; Andrade went to Marroquín's apartment but found it empty, and she was never heard from again.&lt;ref name=is&gt;{{cite news |title=Body Is Identified, Linked To West Boca |author=Kevin Krause |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-09-30/news/9909290806_1_barrel-el-salvador-howard-elkins |newspaper=Sun Sentinel |date=September 30, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports that when a woman fitting Marroquín's description appeared once with a toddler at Melrose Plastics, employees had joked that the child's father was Elkins.&lt;ref name=affair/&gt;

==Investigation==
Detectives who interviewed Elkins found him uncooperative, and told him they intended to obtain an order to take his [[DNA]] for comparison with that of the [[fetus]] found inside Marroquín. The next day, September 10, 1999, Elkins was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&lt;ref name=adds&gt;{{cite news |title=Suicide Adds to Mystery Of Corpse Found in Barrel |author=Robert McFadden |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/13/nyregion/suicide-adds-to-mystery-of-corpse-found-in-barrel.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=links/&gt;&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref name=in&gt;{{cite news |title=Body in Barrel Is Believed to Be Woman Who Vanished in '69 |author=John T.

The DNA testing found that Elkins was almost certainly the father of the fetus.&lt;ref name=links&gt;{{cite news |title=DNA Links Suicide To Killing |author=Kevin Krause |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-01-22/news/0001220143_1_elkins-unborn-child-dna |newspaper=Sun Sentinel |date=January 22, 2000 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators believe Elkins either went to Marroquín's [[New Jersey]] apartment or lured her to the factory and killed her.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; He then took her body to the Nassau County house, possibly with the intention of dumping her in the ocean from his boat, but after filling the barrel with plastic [[wikt:pellet|pellet]]s to ensure it would sink, he found it too heavy to move and left it in the crawl space.&lt;ref name=FDM/&gt;&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;

Writer [[Oscar J. Corral|Oscar Corral]] went to [[San Martín, San Salvador]], where Marroquín's 95-year-old mother told him she had dreamt about Marroquín trapped inside a barrel.&lt;ref name=newsdaydream&gt;{{cite news |title='I Had a Dream ...

{{Piracy in China}}

The '''''North Star'' affair''' occurred in May 1861 when [[China|Chinese]] [[pirate]]s attacked the [[United Kingdom|British]] merchant ship ''[[North Star]]''. Several men were killed in the incident, including a [[Royal Navy]] officer. The pirates escaped capture with 4,000 dollars' worth of gold.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4600092&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affair==
[[File:Hmspearl.jpg|left|thumb|HMS ''Pearl'', circa 1856]]
The affair began on 13 May 1861, when the British [[brig]] ''North Star'' left [[Hong Kong]] for [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. The ship was unarmed except for a few muskets and pistols belonging to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Voight of the Royal Navy [[corvette]] {{HMS|Pearl|1855|6}}, and the other Europeans on board. Most of the people aboard the brig were Chinese civilians though some were pirates, according to [[Henry Marks]], who was a fourth mate on ''North Star''. Marks claimed that the [[compradore]] at Hong Kong, named Ty-kee, was in league with the pirates as he placed a young Chinese boy and a [[Steward's assistant|steward]] on the ship who acted suspiciously during the event. At 3:00 pm, ''North Star'' was about thirty miles from the port of Hong Kong, near [[Ling Ting]], when a two-masted [[Junk (ship)|junk]] was spotted. It then quickly maneuvered alongside of ''North Star'' and her crew began throwing "''stinkpots''" as Henry Marks described. The pots contained a smelly, flammable liquid and were used commonly by the Chinese pirates for taking over merchantmen. ''North Star''{{'}}s [[helmsman]] was the first casualty; he was apparently burned to death by the pots.&lt;ref&gt;Sellick, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty to thirty pirates then boarded the vessel with spears and swords and went after the remaining crewmen and any of the passengers who resisted. Captain Voight was overpowered and wounded by six of the pirates in his cabin before he could load his guns. One seaman fought the Chinese with a [[handspike]] before being wounded; he later died on 16 May along with the captain. The chief officer also died on 14 May of his stab wounds and a passenger was stabbed and thrown overboard where he apparently drowned. In all eight men were killed and one other was wounded. Marks late wrote that the Chinese boy helped the pirates find the 4,000 dollars on board and after they removed the two treasure chests they reboarded their junk and sailed away with the boy and the steward. Of the crew there were only three survivors; two young British men survived the encounter by hiding in the ship and when the pirates were gone they steered her back for Hong Kong. Henry Marks survived as well, having swum for several hours, with the help of some floating spears, from the scene of the crime until being thrown onto a group of large rocks {{convert|400|yd|m}} off the coast. Marks was able to see the activities of the pirates after the attack; they anchored in a small bay nearby and didn't leave right away.&lt;ref&gt;Sellick, pg. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

On the next morning, the mate sighted a [[sampan]] and paid the crew 300 dollars to take him to Hong Kong. Captain Voight made a similar arrangement and safely made it to shore in another small boat. Marks reported that the Chinese treated him like a prisoner while on board the sampan and tried to avoid [[Green Island, Hong Kong|Green Island]] where HMS ''Pearl'' was anchored. When Marks was convinced that the Chinese he was next to were pirates, he "jumped up and struck one of them", then grabbed the man and forced the crew to sail to ''Pearl''. At least four of the crewmen and one passenger were killed; the other two survivors, who sailed ''North Star''  back to Hong Kong, were first discovered by the [[Siam]]ese [[barque]] named ''Four Stars'' and then by the boat crews of ''Pearl''.&lt;ref&gt;Sellick, pp. 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year's show featured a banquet for attending cartoonists and the presentation to the guest of honor of a gold brick called the Ignatz Award&lt;ref&gt;[[R. C. Harvey|Harvey, R. C.]] ""Blood &amp; Thunder: Two for Cho, ''The Comics Journal'' #219 (Jan. 2000), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; named in honor of [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]''. Recipients of the Ignatz included [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyar, Jay.

Accessed Dec. 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The OrlandoCon often featured screenings of early TV shows, as well as panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals. In addition, there was a floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants. The show included an autograph area, as well as an Artists' Alley where comics artists signed autographs and sold or produced free sketches.

==History==
The first OrlandoCon was held in September 1974 at the Orlando [[Howard Johnson's]] Convention Center — guests include [[C. C. Beck]], [[Roy Crane]], [[Hal Foster]], [[Ron Goulart]], {{ill|Mel Graff|fr}}, [[Les Turner]], [[Ralph Dunagin]], [[Bill Crooks (comics)|Bill Crooks]], [[Harold McCauley]], "[[Scorchy Smith]]" artist [[Edmund Good]], and Disney artist [[Ralph Kent]].

In 1976 OrlandoCon moved venues from the Howard Johnson Convention Center to the International Inn, where the convention stayed for most of the rest of its existence.

Even though he moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, Charlie Roberts stayed with the OrlandoCon as co-organizer with Jim Ivey until 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1013?articleID=136554 "Superstars: The Charlie Roberts Collection at Hake’s,"] ''Scoop''. Accessed Dec. 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; at which point small press publisher [[Bill Black (comics)|Bill Black]] became involved with the convention.

With the collapse of the [[Comic book collecting|comic book speculating market]] in 1993, the show petered out. The final OrlandoCon was produced by local retailer Mike Kott on September 10–11, 1994, at the Clarion Towers; guests include show founder Jim Ivey and [[Martin Nodell]].&lt;ref name="Sentinal94"/&gt;

The '''pinewood derby''' is a racing event for unpowered, unmanned miniature cars. Pinewood derbies are often run by chapters (packs) of the [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] program of [[Boy Scouts of America]]. With the help of adults, Scouts build their own cars from wood, usually from kits containing a block of [[pine]] wood, plastic [[wheel]]s, and metal [[axle]]s. With the popularity of the pinewood derby, other organizations have developed similar events, and a small industry has developed to provide organizer equipment (e.g. [[race track|tracks]], [[timer]]s, and [[weighing scale|scales]]) and awards (e.g. [[trophy|trophies]] and [[ribbon (award)|ribbons]]). Similar Cub Scouting events include the [[raingutter regatta]] (a race for miniature boats) and the [[space derby]] (a race for rubber band-driven propeller shuttles).

==Origins==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Western Los Angeles County Council Pinewood Derby CSP.png|thumb|2003 patch honoring Don Murphy and celebrating the 50th anniversary of the derby]]
The first pinewood derby was held on May 15, 1953 at the Scout House in [[Manhattan Beach, California]] by Cub Scout Pack 280C (the present Pack 713&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pack713.org |title=Cub Scout Pack 713 &amp;#124; Manhattan Beach, CA |publisher=Pack713.org |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The concept was created by the Pack's Cubmaster Don Murphy, and sponsored by the Management Club at [[North American Aviation]].&lt;ref name="BSA Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bsamuseum.org/exhibits/derby/index.html |work= National Scouting Museum |title= The Pinewood Derby |accessdate= February 29, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080204081656/http://www.bsamuseum.org/exhibits/derby/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy's son was too young to participate in the popular [[Soap Box Derby]] races, so he came up with the idea of racing miniature wood cars. The cars had the same gravity-powered concept as the full-size Soap Box Derby cars, but were much smaller and easier to build.

The pinewood derby had a sensational first year. Murphy and the Management Club of North American Aviation sent out thousands of brochures to anyone who requested more information. The idea spread rapidly, and competitions were held across the country, mainly with recreation departments and nonprofit organizations including the Los Angeles County Department of Recreation. Of all that early enthusiasm, however, only the Boy Scouts of America made it part of an official program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pinewoodpro.com/pinewood-derby-history.php |title= The History of Pinewood Derby Car Racing |work= Pinewood Pro |accessdate= February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John |last= Bogert |title= Scouts Honor&amp;nbsp;— Memorial Set for Creator of the Pinewood Derby |date= July 9, 2008 |work= Daily Breeze |publisher= Los Angeles Newspaper group |url= http://www.dailybreeze.com/ci_9834624 |accessdate= July 11, 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081005203230/http://www.dailybreeze.com/ci_9834624 |archivedate= October 5, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Director of Cub Scouting Service, O. W. (Bud) Bennett, wrote Murphy: "We believe you have an excellent idea, and we are most anxious to make your material available to the Cub Scouts of America." Within the year, the Boy Scouts of America adopted the pinewood derby for use in all Cub Scout packs.

In its October 1954 issue, ''[[Boys' Life]]'' publicized the event and offered plans for the track and a car, which featured "four wheels, four nails, and three blocks of wood."

Murphy continued to run the derby program through the Management Club until his retirement from North American Aviation in 1978. He died in 2008.

In 2003, Pack 713 celebrated the 50th Pinewood Derby along with Packs 287, 759, 275, and former Cub Scouts from the 1953 Pack 280c. A shoulder patch for the [[Western Los Angeles County Council]] that depicted a pinewood derby car and a message of honor to Murphy was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event.

In 1980, the design of the block was changed from a cutout block, consistent with a 1940s style front-engined [[Indy 500]] car, to a rectangular block. The tires were also changed from narrow, hard plastic, to wider "slicks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maximum-velocity.com/pinewood-derby-times-v7i13/ |title=Pinewood Derby Times Newsletter Volume 7 Issue 13 |publisher=Maximum-velocity.com |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the Boy Scouts of America registered Pinewood Derby as an official trademark.&lt;ref name=uspto/&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Pinewood.jpg|thumb|Official car kit]]
When using a kit sold through Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the Scout begins a block of wood, four [[plastic]] wheels, and four [[nail (fastener)|nails]] for axels. The finished car must use all nine pieces, must not exceed a certain weight (usually five ounces (150 grams)),&lt;ref name="bsa_buildit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinewoodderby.org/#/one/buildit |title=Pinewood Derby |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; must not exceed a certain width (usually 2-3/4 inches (7&amp;nbsp;cm))&lt;ref name="bsa_buildit"/&gt; and length (usually 7 inches (17.8&amp;nbsp;cm))&lt;ref name="bsa_buildit"/&gt; and must fit on the track used by that particular Scout pack.

Blocks can be [[whittling|whittled]] with a hand knife, [[bandsaw]], or [[Dremel]] carving tool for major shaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dremelderby.com/ |title=Dremel Pinewood Derby Days |publisher=Dremelderby.com |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decal]]s can be bought at Scout shops or hobby shops. It is also possible to use standard model decals to replicate actual racing cars such as [[Richard Petty]]'s 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]]. The original style is based on open-wheel cars; however, fender or body kits are available, or wheels can simply be placed outboard of the body.

Other than the previous basic design rules, the Cub Scout is able to carve and decorate the car as he chooses. Cars vary from unfinished blocks to whimsical objects, to accurate replicas of actual cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agent86favorites.com/Pages/Pinewood_Derby_000.htm Pinewood Derby Car Construction]{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve racing performance, many Cub Scouts add weights (e.g. coins or other bits of metal) to the final design to bring the car to the maximum allowable weight. Axel friction can be reduced by polishing the nails, but graphite is usually the only lubricant allowed.

The Cub Scout organization intends that Scouts build their own pinewood derby cars and that parents have a secondary construction role. However, it is often the case that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film ''[[Down and Derby]]'', and also in a [[Pinewood Derby (South Park)|2009 episode]] of ''[[South Park]]''. The quest for a fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby car kit costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA&lt;ref name="BSA Rules"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scouting.org/Training/Adult/Supplemental/pinewood.aspx |title= Cub Scout Pinewood Derby Pamphlet|work=33721A |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their particular local district. The [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official BSA kit. Complete cars can be purchased on [[eBay]] and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of [[Woodland Scenics]], sells pre-cut or pre-made cars, as well as official kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.maximum-velocity.com/pinewood-derby-times-v5i3/ |title= The Dark Side: eBay Cars |work= Pinewood Derby Times |accessdate= March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.

==Competition==
[[File:PinewoodFinish.jpg|thumb|right|Finish of a Pinewood Derby heat.]]
The track usually has two to eight lanes and slopes down to the ground, since the cars are powered by [[gravity]]. Tracks may be owned by the pack or rented. The race is run in heats, giving every car the chance to run on each lane. The racers can be grouped with others from the same rank (Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, etc.), or can compete against the pack as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tips to get you started building a Pinewood Derby car track |publisher= ABC Pinewood Car |url= http://www.abc-pinewood-derby.com/pinewood-derby-track.php |accessdate= February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Track Pinewood Derby.jpg|thumb|upright|Car track]]
First, second, and third-place winners usually receive ribbons, medals, or [[trophy|trophies]]. Some packs also award on the basis of car design or styling. The first place race winners get to advance to the district level, then each of the district-wide race winners get to race each other from across the entire council.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Other races==
{{Main article|Wood car racing}}
[[File:Pinewood cars 2004.jpg|thumb|Pinewood derby cars ready to race]]
As the popularity of the pinewood derby grew, other organizations adopted the concept. Pinewood derby is a registered trademark of the BSA,&lt;ref name=uspto&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76447146 |title= Search of Trademark Application and Registration Retrieval system |publisher= U.S. Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate= March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; so most use different names. Each derby has slightly different rules for making and racing their cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shapenrace.net/#!race-rules/c1v94 |title= Pinewood Rules and More |work= ShapeNRace |accessdate= November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car modifications==
[[File:One gram compare.jpg|thumb|Stock wheels (left) and modified (one gram) wheels (right)]]
The force accelerating a pinewood derby car is [[gravity]]; the opposing forces are [[friction]] and [[air drag]]. Therefore, car modifications are aimed at maximizing the [[potential energy]] in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail.&lt;ref name=cowley&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cowley |first= E. Roger |title= Pinewood Derby Physics |journal= The Physics Teacher |volume= 27 |issue= 8 |pages= 610–612 |publisher= American Association of Physics Teachers |date=November 1989 |doi= 10.1119/1.2342889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel [[tread]] can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly so that it does not contact the track and add to the [[rolling resistance]]. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt;

A second consideration is the [[rotational energy]] stored in the wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational [[potential energy]] into translational [[kinetic energy]] (speed) plus rotational energy. Heavier wheels have a greater [[moment of inertia]] and their spinning takes away energy that would otherwise contribute to the speed of the car. A standard wheel has a mass of 2.6 g, but this can be reduced to as little as 1 g by removing material from the inside of the wheel. A raised wheel can reduce the rotational energy up to one-quarter, but this advantage is less with a bumpy track.&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt;

Another consideration is the track itself. A track that is mostly sloping, with little flat at the end, can allow cars with minimal mass in their wheels to shine. However, a track with a steep slope and then a long flat section can penalize such cars due to the quick loss of energy they experience once they have reached the bottom, when all potential energy has been transferred to kinetic and rotational energy. Such cars will take a lead on the downslope, but may be passed by cars with more energy "stored" away as rotational energy on the flat.&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt;

A proper lubricant, typically [[graphite]] powder, is essential. [[Wheel alignment]] is important both to minimize wheel contact with the axle head and body as well as to limit the contact between the wheels and guide rail as the car travels down the track. There are 32 friction causing surfaces on a pinewood derby car. These include the surfaces of all four wheels which touch either the axle, the body or the track and the surfaces of all four axles which touch the wheel. Neglecting to polish and lubricate any of these 32 surfaces will result in degraded performance. The [[center of mass]] of a typical car is low and slightly ahead of the rear axle, which helps the car track straight as well as providing a slight advantage due to the additional gravitational potential energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.maximum-velocity.com/free-speed-tips/ |title= Five Keys to Pine Derby Performance |work= Maximum Velocity |accessdate= September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:pine car winner.jpg|thumb|upright|A Cub Scout holds a winning pine car]]
The pinewood derby was selected as part of "America's 100 Best" in 2006 as "a celebrated rite of spring" by ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006 |url= http://www.rd.com/cub-scouts-pinewood-derby-race/article.html |title= Best Mother-Son Finish |work= Reader's Digest |accessdate= February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has also been parodied by ''South Park'' in the episode "[[Pinewood Derby (South Park)|Pinewood Derby]]" and in the film ''[[Down and Derby]]''.&lt;ref name="BSA Museum"/&gt;

'''Polaris'''  (formerly '''Toronto Trek''') was an annual [[science fiction convention|science fiction and fantasy convention]] held in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], Canada.

It began in 1986 as a [[relaxacon]] as Toronto Trek Celebration.  Two years later, in 1988, Toronto Trek Celebration 2 took place.  In 1989 it dropped the word "Celebration" and became simply "Toronto Trek".  For its twenty-first convention in 2007, the name was changed to "Polaris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/3762|title=Popular Canadian Fan Convention Drops 'Star Trek' Name|last=Hinman|first=Michael|date=2007-06-12|work=Airlock Alpha|publisher=Quantum Global Media|accessdate=2009-07-23|archivedate=2009-07-23|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iUMsXkES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/232503|title=Events|date=2007-07-05|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=2009-07-23|archivedate=2009-07-23|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iUN1lMxg}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Polaris 26, held July 5–7, 2012, it was announced Polaris had come to an end and that a new convention would replace Polaris in 2013.

The convention had a focus on media guests from [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] movies and television series and novel authors such as [[Star Trek]], [[Babylon 5]], [[Stargate]], [[Doctor Who]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]], [[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]], [[Lost (TV series)|Lost]] and [[Battlestar Galactica]]. Photo opportunities, autographs and Question &amp; Answer sessions feature the media guest, who sometimes come to other programming and after hours events.

Polaris was one of several activities run by the TCON Promotional Society by means of a convention committee of more than 100 people grouped into 38 individual teams, each taking care of a different part of the convention. The TCON Promotional Society has coordinated other events, such as the Canadian Conrunners Conference in 2004, Their other current project is the Constellation Awards, a fan-nominated, fan-voted set of Science Fiction Awards with focus on film and television science fiction.  TCON hosted events are proposed to the TCON Board of Directors and voted upon by said Board.  The TCON Promotional Society is a not-for-profit corporation based out of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The '''Relay of Youth''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''Štafeta mladosti'', Serbian [[Cyrillic]] ''Штафета младости'', [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''Штафета на младоста'', [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''Stafeta e Rinise'') was a symbolic [[relay race]] held in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] every year.  The relay carried a baton with a birthday pledge to [[Josip Broz Tito]] ostensibly from all young people of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="majamikula"&gt;Maja Mikula.

It ended in [[Belgrade]] at [[Stadion FK Partizan|JNA Stadium]] on May 25, Tito's official birthday&lt;ref&gt;Although Tito's birthday was celebrated on May 25, he was in all probability born on May 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Youth Day#Yugoslavia|Day of Youth]], a [[Public holiday|national holiday]].

The relay first took place in 1945 and was formalized as a national holiday in 1957.  It went on after Tito's death in 1980 and was last held in 1988.&lt;ref name="nskrelay"/&gt;

In 1987, the winning poster design for the relay caused a national scandal, as it was revealed to have been based on a [[Nazi]] propaganda poster.&lt;ref name="majamikula"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nskposter"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080406035137/http://www.nskstate.com/nk/poster_scandal.php Poster Scandal - Youth Day]" NSKSTATE.COM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regina Hackett.

Along with the rising [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|crisis of the Yugoslav state]], this scandal is deemed to have significantly contributed to the decision to discontinue the Relay.

===Allonyms and pseudonyms===

Since 1996 Turovsky has signed his musical works as ''Sautscheck'', a German [[transliteration]] of the second part of his surname as an [[allonym]]. Turovsky used a variety of  constructions, such as Joachim Peter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaviva.com/encyclopedia/display.html?phrase=sautscheck-joachim-peter Musica Viva Encyclopedia: Sautscheck, Joachim Peter]. Musicaviva.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Joachim, and Konradin Aemilius, for first names attached to Sautscheck.  He represented the works as newly discovered manuscripts by supposed 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century composers from several generations of the same family.

His works for lute achieved wide circulation under the [[allonym]] of Sautscheck and the pseudonyms "Ioannes Leopolita" and "Jacobus Olevsiensis".  Musicologist [[Douglas Alton Smith]] perceived these works as malicious [[hoax]]es and forgeries because of their ostensibly [[baroque]] or earlier styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serenestudios.co.uk/articles/musical_crimes "Musical Crimes: Forgery, Deceit, and Socio-Hermeneutics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918235901/http://www.serenestudios.co.uk/articles/musical_crimes |date=18 September 2008 }}, Serene Studios, accessed 13 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy in 2000 over what some considered an outright hoax led to coinage of a new German word, ''Sautscheckerei'', which denoted a musical or literary hoax.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forumdaily.com/muzykalnye-mistifikacii/&lt;/ref&gt;

Turovsky published ''Mikrokosmos'', a collection of nearly 600 [[Renaissance]]-styled pieces based on Ukrainian folk melodies under the pseudonyms "Ioannes Leopolita" and "Jacobus Olevsiensis".

==Literary activities==

Turovsky's poetry translations (from Russian, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and other languages) have appeared in the literary almanacs [[Cardinal Points]],&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Points, vol.7 (September 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Germ'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://germspot.blogspot.com/2005/04/germ-67.html The Germ: Germ #6/7]. Germspot.blogspot.com (18 May 2005). Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and various web publications.

He also undertook research into the history of [[Torban]], a Ukrainian [[musical instrument]] of the [[lute]] family, and wrote the chapter on it for the 2011 edition of "Die Laute in Europa".&lt;ref&gt;"Geluit-Luthinerie" (The Belgian Lute Society Journal) No.&amp;nbsp;54, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Die Laute in Europa 2" A.Schlegel &amp; J.Lüdtke&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spring Stampex 2011.jpg|right|thumb|Spring Stampex 2011.]]
'''Stampex''' is a twice yearly British [[stamp show]] held at the [[Business Design Centre]] (BDC) at Islington, London, every Spring and Autumn. The show is organised by the [[Philatelic Traders Society]] (PTS) through their company ''PTS Stamp and Coin Exhibitions Limited'' and has been running for many years.  The next exhibition will be held on 12-15 September 2018.

==Elements of the show==
The show consists mainly of stands from stamp dealers who are members of the PTS but specialist [[philatelic]] societies often hold meetings at the BDC in conjunction with the show.

Until recently competitive stamp exhibitions were also held. The Association of British Philatelic Societies (ABPS) has announced that they will be reintroduced with effect from the Autumn 2009 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/abps/latestnews/ABPS_Competitions.html |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203231454/http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/abps/latestnews/ABPS_Competitions.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important parts of the show include a youth area run by the National Youth Stamp Group and a large stand from Britain's [[Royal Mail]] where recent British stamp issues are on sale.

==Souvenirs==
Admission is free of charge and visitors usually receive a modest philatelic souvenir of some kind. At the Spring 2009 show a postcard was given featuring unadopted artwork by stamp designer [[Jeffery Matthews]] for a proposed 1979 Welsh Assembly stamp issue. These souvenirs have become collectable. Each Stampex issues a Smilers Sheet (released in conjunction with Stanley Gibbons, the official sponsors of Stampex, and Royal Mail) available for purchase as well as a free commemorative postcard.

==History==
Stampex has not always been at the BDC. For many years it was located at the Central Hall, Westminster when it was organised between the PTS and The Junior Philatelic Society (now the [[National Philatelic Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/childrens-newspaper/CN630316-010.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Children's Newspaper |date=16 March 1963 |website=Lookandlearn.vom |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other British shows ==
There is no other regular national show competing with Stampex in the UK, although many smaller shows take place and an [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie|FIP]] endorsed international show takes place in London every ten years, with the next being the London 2020 International Stamp Exhibition.

The name has been adopted for stamp shows in other countries, for instance Hong Kong Stampex and Adelaide Stampex, however, none are connected with the British version.

'''''Subways Are for Sleeping''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] produced by David Merrick with a book and lyrics by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] and music by [[Jule Styne]].  The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production played in 1961–62.

The musical was inspired by an article about [[New York City Subway|subway]] [[homelessness]] in the March 1956 issue of [[Harper's]] and a subsequent 1957 book based on it, both by [[Edmund G. Love]], who slept on subway trains throughout the 1950s and encountered many unique individuals.  With the profits from his book, Love then embarked on a bizarre hobby: over the course of several years, he ate dinner at every restaurant listed in the [[Manhattan]] [[yellow pages]] directory, visiting them in alphabetical order.  A previous adaptation of the Harper's article was aired August 3, 1956 on [[CBS Radio Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audio-classics.com/lcbsradioworkshop.html Audio Classics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Angie McKay is a magazine writer assigned to write a story about a group of well-dressed homeless people sleeping in the New York subway system. Their leader is Tom Bailey, a one-man employment agency who finds other drifters odd jobs and sleeping quarters. To help research her story, Angie goes undercover and pretends to be a stranded girl from out-of-town. Trouble ensues when Tom discovers her real identity.

==Broadway production==
After two previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed and [[choreographed]] by [[Michael Kidd]], opened on December 27, 1961 at the [[St. James Theatre]], where it ran for 205 performances. The cast included [[Orson Bean]], [[Sydney Chaplin]], [[Carol Lawrence]], [[Gordon Connell (actor)|Gordon Connell]], Grayson Hall, and Green's wife [[Phyllis Newman]] (whose costume, consisting solely of a towel, was probably [[Freddy Wittop]]'s easiest design in his distinguished career), with newcomers [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] and [[Valerie Harper]] in the chorus.

''Subways Are for Sleeping'' opened to mostly negative reviews. The show already was hampered by a lack of publicity, since the [[New York City Transit Authority]] refused to post advertisements on the city's buses and in subway trains and stations for fear they would be perceived as officially sanctioning the right of vagrants to use these facilities as overnight accommodations.  [[File:"Subways Are for Sleeping" hoax ad.jpg|right|thumb|The advertisement]] Producer [[David Merrick]] and press agent Harvey Sabinson decided to invite individuals with the same names as prominent theatre critics (such as [[Walter Kerr]], [[Richard Watts, Jr.]] and [[Howard Taubman]]) to see the show, and afterwards used their favorable comments in print ads. Thanks to photographs of the seven "critics" accompanying their blurbs (the well-known real Richard Watts was not [[African American]]), the ad was discovered to be a deception. It was pulled from most newspapers, but not before running in an early edition of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''. However, the clever [[publicity stunt]] allowed the musical to continue to run and it eventually turned a small profit.

Newman won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and nominations went to Bean for Best Featured Actor and Kidd's choreography.

An [[cast album|original cast recording]] was released by [[Columbia Records]]. A revival production was briefly mounted in 2009.

Alternative names used to refer to the incident include the '''Xilai Temple Incident''' after the [[Xilai Temple]] in [[Tainan]], where the revolt began, and the '''Yu Qingfang Incident''' after the leader [[Yu Qingfang]].&lt;ref name="Tsai2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|title=Lee Teng-Hui and Taiwan's Quest for Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ge_FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=tapani+incident&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lvi2VOm7LIOlgwT_oICQAg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=tapani%20incident&amp;f=false|date=2 September 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4039-7717-5|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolt==
Multiple Japanese police stations were stormed by Aboriginal and Han Chinese fighters under Chiang Ting (Jiang Ding) and Yü Ch'ing-fang (Yu Qingfang).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070924110630/http://iao.sinica.edu.tw/significant-research-results-pdf/090-094-em19.pdf Governmentality and Its Consequences in Colonial Taiwan: A Case Study of the Ta-pa-ni Incident]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Modern Taiwanese [[historiography]] attempts to portray the Tapani Incident as a nationalist uprising either from a Chinese ([[Chinese reunification|unification]]) or Taiwanese ([[Taiwan independence|independence]]) perspective. Japanese colonial historiography attempted to portray the incident as a large scale instance of banditry led by criminal elements. However, the Tapani Incident differs from other uprisings in Taiwan's history because of its elements of [[millenarianism]] and [[folk religion]], which enabled Yu Qingfang to raise a significant armed force whose members believed themselves to be invulnerable to modern weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Paul R.|title=When Valleys Turned Blood Red: The Tapani Incident in Colonial Taiwan|date=2005|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|pages=110|isbn=9780824829155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarities between the rhetoric of the leaders of the Tapani uprising and the [[Righteous Harmony Society]] of the recent [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China were not lost on Japanese colonial authorities, and the colonial government subsequently paid more attention to popular religion and took steps to improve colonial administration in southern Taiwan.

The aboriginals carried on with violent armed struggle against the Japanese while Han Chinese violent opposition stopped after Tapani.&lt;ref name="Crook2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Crook|title=Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3YOoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=tapani+incident&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lvi2VOm7LIOlgwT_oICQAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=tapani%20incident&amp;f=false|date=5 June 2014|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-497-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Quickening Maze''''' is a 2009 historical fictional novel by British poet and author [[Adam Foulds]] and published by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book received the [[Encore Award]] (2009), [[European Union Prize for Literature]] (2011) and was shortlisted for [[Man Booker Prize]] (2009) and [[Walter Scott Prize]] (2010). The book is based on the historical backdrop of a mental asylum run by Matthew Allen at [[High Beach]] in late 1830s and 1840s which had English poet [[John Clare]] admitted therein. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], another notable poet of the era, moves to High Beach to get his brother Septimus treated and Alfred, himself, has to overcome depression after the death of his close friend [[Arthur Hallam]]. The book narrates Clare's life, the asylum's effects on both poets and bases its storyline on the popular speculation of whether Clare and Tennyson had ever met.

== Plot ==
Dr Matthew Allen runs an asylum called High Beach Private Asylum for mental patients of his. John Clare, a peasant poet from Northamptonshire who is not so famous then, is admitted in the asylum for his lunatic behaviours, memory lapses and delusions. Dr Allen treats his patients differently from other mental institutes given them much freedom; especially to Clare by recognizing his talent in poetry. Alfred Tennyson's brother Septimus faces depression and he is also admitted in the asylum. Tennyson and his family move to High Beach and stay nearby the asylum. Dr Allen has an history of debts and was once imprisoned for frauds. He is now collecting funds for a new carpentry machine called "Pyroglyph" that he claims to have patented in UK. He convinces Tennyson and his family to invest in the machine. Various patients with characteristic personalities and disorders have been included. A certain George Laidlaw is show to be obsessed with the national debt and Margaret keeps believing that God is speaking to her. Charles Seymour is from an aristocratic family and he is wrongly placed in the asylum by his family to avoid his marriage with his lover who the family deems unsuitable for him. Various incidences of sexual violence between fellow inmates are noted in the asylum. Allen's teenage daughter, Hannah, craves for attention and starts fancying Tennyson. When she gets nothing out of it, she falls for Seymour. Tennyson is also brooding over the death of his friend [[Arthur Hallam]] and is shown working on a memorial to Hallam. Clare starts roaming about in the woods of [[Epping Forest]] coming in contact with local gypsies. He treasures these wanderings where he finds time for his poems, if he is not claiming to be a prize fighter or [[Lord Byron]] or [[Shakespeare]]. Tennyson loses much of his family fortunes in the wrong investments and decides to return to London determined to write about Hallam and Clare runs away from the institute and sets on his four-day walking journey back to his home finally reaching to his wife.

== History ==
John Clare was born in a poor farming family. In 1820 he had published his first poetry book which won him the epithet of "Northamptonshire Peasant Poet".&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10" /&gt; In 1836 he started having memory lapses and the next year he voluntarily got admitted in Dr Allen's asylum and stayed there until he ran away in 1841 and went on his four-day walk from Essex to [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] near Peterborough. Clare stayed with his wife for few months before being admitted to [[Northampton General Lunatic Asylum]].&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10" /&gt;

Tennyson's brother Septimus was a patient of Allen between 1837 and 1840. Tennyson and his family on various occasions stayed in the nearby houses.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2012"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTwYMfjV7lYC&amp;pg=PA108 | title=Tennyson: To strive, to seek, to find | publisher=Random House | author=Batchelor, John | year=2012 | pages=108 | isbn=978-1-4481-3856-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennyson invested {{GBP}} 3,000 in mid-1840s in Allen's invention "Pyroglyph" and his three sisters added {{GBP}} 4,000 to the investment. Failure of the machine led to bankruptcy of Allen and great loss to the Tennyson family.&lt;ref name="Hagger2012"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAntBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT173&amp;lpg=PT173&amp;dq=john+clare+met+tennyson | title=A View of Epping Forest | publisher=John Hunt Publishing | author=Hagger, Nicholas | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-78099-588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tennyson left High Beach and then went on to write ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]''.&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10" /&gt;

Allen ran an asylum for mentally challenged people and separated it into three houses; Fair Mead for men, Springfield for women and Leopard's Hill Lodge for severe patients of either gender. Visitors and patient's relatives have noted normality kept inside the asylum. He also went on to raise a fund to enable Clare to stay independently.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2012" /&gt; He died in 1845 and Tennyson got some financial help from Allen's insurance.&lt;ref name="Hagger2012" /&gt;

Historically, it is not known whether Tennyson and Clare had met each other while they both stayed together in the area in the same period.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagger2012" /&gt; But Clare's biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] speculates that although the two poets might not have met in the asylum, both used to take walks in the forest and also had a common friend; the son of poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]].&lt;ref name="Bate2011"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WZZDysAUv0C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=john+clare+met+tennyson | title=John Clare | publisher=Pan Macmillan | author=Bate, Jonathan | authorlink=Jonathan Bate | year=2011 | pages=232 | isbn=978-1-4472-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''The Quickening Maze'', the two poets never meet.&lt;ref name="NS14May09" /&gt;

== Reception ==
''[[The Independent]]'' in the review written by [[Simon Kövesi]], who is editor of the ''John Clare Society Journal'', summed the book to be "a heady mix of delicacy and grotesquery, intimacy and misanthropy."&lt;ref name="TI29May09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-quickening-maze-by-adam-foulds-1692331.html  |title= The Quickening Maze, by Adam Foulds |author= Kövesi, Simon |date= 29 May 2009|work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Adam Foulds notes that ''[[The Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' that he studied in his college days dedicated only four pages to Clare but the poet's reputation increased significantly after [[Jonathan Bate]] published Clare's biography in 2003. Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', editor [[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]] notes that the book is not the biography of Clare but "its finely tuned sympathy will bring you close to the soul of an exuberant poet".&lt;ref name="WP23Jun10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062204374.html |title= Book review of 'The Quickening Maze' by Alan Foulds |author=Charles, Ron |date=23 June 2010 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles also notes that the most moving parts of the book are of the episodes where Clare is wandering in the forest. The review in ''[[New Statesman]]'' appreciates Foulds for penning Clare's character that thinks in poems and also deemed Dr Allen and Tennyson's scenes together as awkward because of the historical nature of the book.&lt;ref name="NS14May09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/05/tennyson-novel-clare-allen |title=The Quickening Maze  |author=Ahmed, Fatema |date=14 May 2009 |work=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and author [[Lionel Shriver]] notes that Foulds, who won [[Costa Poetry Award]] in 2008, keeps the book poetic without losing the plot. She also appreciates that despite featuring two poets with a background of mental asylum, the book does not "conjure insanity as an exalted state of literary enlightenment."&lt;ref name="TG14May09"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5323616/The-Quickening-Maze-by-Adam-Foulds-review.html |title= The Quickening Maze by Adam Foulds: review |author=Shriver, Lionel |authorlink= Lionel Shriver |date=14 May 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] mentions that Foulds has created his own poems in the book; like "thick curds of summer cloud moving slowly over"; while narrating the two poets and not simply borrowing their works.&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/28/asylum-2 |title=Asylum – A novel about the poet John Clare |author=Wood, James |date=28 June 2010 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian writer [[Neel Mukherjee (writer)|Neel Mukherjee]] calls the book a "subtle meditation on the mysterious nature of the creative process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/behind-brand-booker/article28862.ece | title=Behind brand Booker | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=4 October 2009 | accessdate=14 June 2016 | author=Roy, Anuradha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
The book was nominated for the [[Man Booker Prize]]. It was shortlisted along with [[Hilary Mantel]]'s historic novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' about [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[A. S. Byatt]]'s novel ''[[The Children's Book]]'', Nobel laureate [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s novel ''[[Summertime (novel)|Summertime]]'', [[Simon Mawer]]'s novel ''[[The Glass Room]]'' and [[Sarah Waters]]'s gothic fiction novel ''[[The Little Stranger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/backlist/2009 |title=The Man Booker Prize 2009 |work=Man Booker Award |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Quickening Maze'' was called a "rank outsider" when it was shortlisted with these books: Mantel's work won the award, as several sources had speculated it would.&lt;ref name="WP23Jun10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian29May16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman19June10" /&gt;

The book won the [[Encore Award]] for 2009–10 and the judges [[Alex Clark (journalist)|Alex Clark]], Lindsay Duguid and Peter Parker described it as "a confident, beautifully written historical novel, seamed with poetry and intense descriptions of the natural world, which unobtrusively deploys its documentary underpinnings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/foulds-wins-encore-prize | title=Fould wins Encore Prize | work=[[The Bookseller]] | date=11 May 2011 | accessdate=29 May 2016 | author=Allen, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tornrak''''' is the third [[opera]] by [[Wales|Welsh]] composer [[John Metcalf (composer)|John Metcalf]]. It has an English-language [[libretto]] by [[Michael Wilcox]] with [[Inuktitut]] sections translated by Blendina Makkik.&lt;ref name =Genesis /&gt; Set between the worlds of the Canadian [[Arctic]] and Victorian Britain, it features [[Inuit throat singing]] and other [[Vocal extended technique|extended vocal techniques]] that give the Arctic scenes a distinct character. The opera was composed between 1986 and 1990 when Metcalf was working in Canada. It was first staged in 1990 in a co-production by the [[Banff Centre]], where Metcalf worked, and the [[Welsh National Opera]] who had commissioned the work.

==Composition==
Although [[Welsh National Opera]] (WNO) had first discussed with Metcalf the possibility of his writing a second opera, after ''The Journey'', for them in 1981,&lt;ref name=Genesis&gt;Mark Morris "The Genesis of Tornrak" in Simon Rees (ed.) ''Tornrak'' programme, Welsh National Opera, 1990, pp.19–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Composer profile, p.38 of WNO programme.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until 1986 that  [[Brian McMaster]], the company's then managing director, first brought the composer and librettist together.&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt;  After Wilcox had initially started work on another idea, Metcalf contacted him about the true story of a 19th-century [[Inuit]] girl, Milak, who rescued a British sailor, Arthur. Like the character in the opera, the true Milak was shown as a [[circus freak]]; unlike her, she returned home.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;Michael Wilcox "Writing the libretto" in Simon Rees (ed.) ''Tornrak'' programme, Welsh National Opera 1990, pp.17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of ''Tornrak'' was greatly influenced by Metcalf's move to Canada later in 1986 to teach on the Music Theatre course at the [[Banff Centre]] in [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;  He subsequently became Artistic Director of the programme and Composer-in-Residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banffcentre.ca/theatre/history/opera/production_1996B/biographies.asp#metcalf Biography of Metcalf for ''Kafka's Chimp''], Banff Centre website, Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilcox visited Metcalf in Canada that winter to work on the first draft of the libretto and used the library facilities there to learn about Inuit traditions and mythology.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt; Metcalf too found that the setting enabled him to portray their subject in a more genuine manner. "If I wasn't in the North itself, at least I could now be in contact with a way of looking at the world, the culture, the music, and the language of the Inuit that would have been absolutely impossible in Wales."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Morris "The Genesis of ''Tornrak''" p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 onwards, Metcalf tried out sections of the developing opera in workshops at Banff. Such support for new compositions were an important facet of the programme there.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt; He also had ready access to experienced colleagues such as Keith Turnbull, the Assistant Director on the course, and Richard E. Armstrong who had worked with [[Roy Hart]]. Just as [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] had composed ''[[Eight Songs for a Mad King]]'' with Hart's unusual voice and extended vocal techniques in mind, so Metcalf was able to compose ''Tornrak'' knowing that Armstrong would participate in the opera and also coach the other performers. Armstrong's repertoire of unusual sounds were used in the writing for the spirits and animals. The Inuit parts also required techniques new to Western singers. Fides Krucker, who played the part of Milak in Banff, visited [[Iqaluit]] in 1989 and 1990. There she learnt the [[Inuit throat singing]] techniques which she used in her performances and on which she advised Metcalf.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;

Wilcox encouraged Metcalf to make any changes to the libretto that he needed. He himself revisited Banff again to update the text.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt; Even when he was in Britain, he would respond to urgent phone calls to make changes during the workshops.&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt; One of the most significant of the changes to the libretto was the decision to translate much of the first act from English into Inuktitut. Differences in stress patterns between the two languages meant that Metcalf recomposed vocal lines, moving material initially intended to be sung into the orchestral parts.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;

Meanwhile, WNO had agreed to a change in the scale of ''Tornrak''. Instead of it being a [[chamber opera]] using just ten singers to be performed in small venues in Wales, it would now use a larger cast including a chorus and be staged in the large venues normally used by the full company. While those who were involved in the project were sure that the final work was stronger than it would have otherwise been, the many changes resulted in severe delays to the opera's completion and led to repeated postponements of the first performance.&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt;

==Performance history==
''Tornrak'' was given a "World Preview Performance", without a chorus, in workshops in Banff on 23 February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmetcalf.co.uk/works.php?name=Tornrak&amp;id=9 "Tornrak"] details at composer's website.

==Description==
''Tornrak'' is scored for strings, flute, piccolo, oboe, (doubling cor anglais,) 2 clarinets, (doubling E flat clarinets,) bassoon (doubling contra bassoon,) 2 horns, trumpet, trombone, tuba, piano, vibraphone and separate percussionist. The first act is based on an ascending scale running from C through F to C again using the five black notes; the second act uses a descending scale, again based on C but this time using all white notes taken from the [[major scale]] with the exception of the [[augmented fourth|sharpened F]] ([[eleventh harmonic]]).&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

While the opera is representative of the composer's early musical style,&lt;ref name=Groveonline /&gt; it also advances it.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; The music is multi-layered and rhythmically complex, much of it using middle colours including woodwind and tuned percussion. In Metcalf's first opera, ''The Journey'', solo instruments, usually high pitched, reacted to the voices; ''Tornrak'' makes only occasional use of solo violin or the upper registers of the piano. Extreme colours and registers serve to increase the contrasts already present in earlier works.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

On the non-musical level, too, ''Tornrak'' develops ideas seen in the composer's earlier works. Metcalf's sometime collaborator, the writer Mark Morris, notes that Metcalf's first two operas and his [[cantata]] ''The Boundaries of Time'' had already considered such themes as the clash of cultures, the alienation of individuals from their surroundings, the attempts of humanity to communicate with Nature and the displacement of individuals from their homelands.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;"Tornrak" in programme for the WNO production pp.13–15&lt;/ref&gt; These all appear in his third opera. ''Tornrak'' presents the theme of clashing cultures most strongly in two crowd scenes musically distinct from the balance of the score: in the fair and court scenes, the music is vertical, reflecting the clash in values between those present, whereas in most of the opera each layer has its own momentum and the music develops horizontally, representing individual destinies that largely develop autonomously.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

The score is remarkable for its incorporation of [[Inuit throat singing]] and other extended vocal techniques, establishing distinct sound worlds for the scenes set in the Arctic and those set in Victorian Britain.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;Malcolm Boyd (1999) "Metcalf, John" in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', version dated 25/01/99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Groveonline&gt;Geraint Lewis, "Metcalf, John", Grove Music Online, accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous singers took part in the workshops in Banff and also travelled to Wales to train the WNO cast.&lt;ref&gt;Geraint Lewis (2005) Sleevenotes to ''John Metcalf: Mapping Wales, Plain Chants, Cello Symphony'' Nimbus Records, NI 5746.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not uncommon for opera to mix different national music styles when portraying clashes between cultures, ''Tornrak'' stands out because both Inuit music and its singing techniques are foreign to the Western musical tradition.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;

==Reception==
The North American performances won the 1991 National Opera Association Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banffcentre.ca/bsaf/2004/history/#80_90 "Festival History"], Banff Centre site, Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Best New Opera award from [[Opera America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=265&amp;facId=72&amp;p=member Profile of Richard Armstrong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306055926/http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=265&amp;facId=72&amp;p=member |date=6 March 2012 }}, Banff Centre, Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The production team, led by Mike Ashman, won praise for its creativity with the limited resources available.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Millington]] "Ashman, Mike" in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the Welsh premiere, [[Rodney Milnes]] described ''Tornrak'' as "[a]n absorbing, thought-provoking and very approachable new opera" and as more successful than Metcalf's first opera ''The Journey''. Milnes particularly praises the economy of writing in both the libretto and the score.&lt;ref&gt;Milnes, Rodney "Arts: Tornrak : New Theatre, Cardiff", ''[[Financial Times]]'', Monday, 21 May 1990, p.13.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
1850, a British naval survey ship, the ''Endeavour'', is in the Canadian Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;The synopsis is derived from that in the programme to the 1990 WNO production edited by Simon Rees pp.4–6, supplemented with the English version of the Inuktitut parts of the text on pp.7–10 and comments by the librettist on pp.17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; After being told by the Mate that Arthur Nesbit, a sailor from [[North Shields]], has been behaving in a disruptive manner, the Captain asks him to explain his conduct. The rest of Act I and most of Act II is told in flashback.

1845, the ''Enterprise'', a sister ship of ''Endeavour'', has foundered in the Arctic. Arthur and three others escape into the ice. One of them, Kellett, kills Collinson, a young officer, after they argue over some valuables. Kellett and the last sailor Billy escape without Arthur who is saved from starvation only when he sees a polar bear taking meat from its hidden store. Arthur dreams of returning home and of the rich life he would afford with the valuables. An apparition warns him that he needs to survive first.

Milak, a young [[Inuit|Inuk]], arrives led by her ''[[Inuit_mythology#Tuurngait|tornrak]]'', or spirit guide, that takes the form of an owl. She knows of the bear's meat cache and intends to raid it. The ''tornrak'' abandons her when she notices signs of Arthur's presence. Milak wonders whether it has led her into a trap. Arthur, in turn, thinks she has come to steal from him. 

The bear returns and the two humans fight it. The spirits of Inuit hunters sing that the bear's time has come and Arthur strikes the killing blow. Milak throat-sings with the dying animal and frees its ''tornrak'' by skinning it. She gives Arthur the pelt. She leads him towards her village which has been devastated by disease caught from the British. On the way she persuades him to leave behind the valuables that have been slowing him down, but she decides to keep the "Great White Bird flying with many wings", a [[Impossible bottle|ship in a bottle]] that reminds her of her ''tornrak''.

When they return to the village, only Milak's father Utak is still alive. Expecting death, he tears off his clothing and calls his ''tornrak''. It kills him as payment for all the help it has given him since childhood, leaving his bones unburied and his spirit to wander.

During the Winter, Arthur and Milak learn bits of each other's languages. In the Spring, they are discovered by a British ship which has come to trade with the village. The explorer Sir Charles Keighley decides to take Milak to Britain to help with his research. She agrees because she thinks the ship is her ''tornrak''.

===Act II===
Sir Charles has given the last of his lectures on the Arctic and is thanked by Lady Delisle at her home. Now he has finished with Milak, he tells Arthur to look after her.

Arthur and Milak, "The Wild Savage of the Frozen North", join a [[Traveling carnival|travelling fair]] in Wales where she is shown to members of the public in a cage. The spectators find her performance frightening. Another member of the fair, a bearkeeper, tries to rape her. Although she escapes him, she is locked in her cage. She persuades the bear to break open the cage and then escape. The crowd are frightened by it and a constable shoots it despite the bearkeeper's pleas. Both he and Arthur find themselves without exhibits.

Milak survives in the country by catching animals such as rabbits and sheep. A molecatcher warns her that she could be hanged for theft. She moves to an industrial town where she becomes a prostitute. She meets Arthur again who tries to persuade her to return to the Arctic but she thinks this is now impossible as she has become Westernised and cut off from Nature. The two are recognised by the bearkeeper who has Milak arrested as the wild woman who has been reported to be stealing sheep. The Judge sentences her to hang despite protests from Arthur and the spectators that she had no other option.

Back on the ''Endeavour'', Arthur has finished his narration. The Captain leaves him in charge of the helm. Arthur tears off his clothes and calls to Milak's spirit in the hope that the ship will be sunk and the Inuit protected from the dangers its crew bring. In a squall, Milak's ''tornrak'' arrives, once more in the form of an owl. 

Arthur is found dead and frozen to the wheel. Only the Mate is willing to obey the Captain and remove the body. When he throws the corpse overboard, the squall stops and the ship is suddenly becalmed. There is no reading on the compass.

The '''White Coat Ceremony''' ('''WCC''') is a relatively new [[ritual]] in some [[medical]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]), [[dentistry|dental]], [[optometry]], [[audiology]],  [[chiropractic]], dietetic,  [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[podiatry|podiatric]], [[pharmacy]], [[physician assistant]], pathologists' assistant,  [[nursing]], naturopathic and [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] schools that marks the [[student]]'s transition from the study of preclinical to clinical health sciences.  At some schools, where students begin meeting patients early in their education, the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins. It is an example of a [[matriculation]].

WCCs typically involve a formal "coating" of students.

==Description==

Over 100 medical schools in the United States now have a WCC, and many students now consider it a [[rite of passage]] in the journey toward a healthcare career.  Some schools also use this as a graduation from the entire program. For example, [[Moreno Valley College]] has a White Coat Ceremony for the Physician Assistant students at the end of their final term, where the short coats are discarded and long coats are given as a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats.

According to some{{who|date=June 2012}}, WCCs have taken on a quasi-religious significance, that symbolizes a "conversion" of a [[lay person]] into a member of the healthcare profession&lt;ref name=veatch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veatch RM |title=White coat ceremonies: a second opinion |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11834749 |doi= 10.1136/jme.28.1.5|url=http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11834749 |pmc=1733513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is similar to a priest's ordination to the [[priesthood]], although it is notable that the white coat is a recent adoption by the medical profession. However, in many medical schools around the world students begin wearing their white coats during first year anatomy class, so there is no official white coat ceremony.

In the nineteenth century respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the [[quackery]] and [[Medieval medicine|mysticism]] of ni kineteenth century medicine.  To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist - the white laboratory coat.&lt;ref&gt;Jones VA, "The White Coat: Why not Follow Suit?" JAMA. 1999;281:478. [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/281/5/478 Full Text].&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the more recent association of the white coat with medicine since its continued adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23.

WCCs originated in [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;Warren, Peter M. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/18/local/me-23619 For New Medical Students, White Coats Are a Warmup]" ''Los Angeles Times'', 18 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but the first full-fledged ceremony was at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt; In 1993, Dr. [[Arnold P.

Since starting in the US, several medical schools in countries outside of the United States (such as [[Iran]], Israel, Canada, [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Brazil]] and [[Poland]]) have also started holding WCCs. The ceremony is no longer limited to medical students; starting in 1995, US pharmacy schools started holding WCCs, with the difference that most pharmacy students receive their coats at the end of their first academic year. In 2003 a survey found that the majority of US pharmacy schools hold WCCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown DL, Ferrill MJ, Pankaskie MC |title=White coat ceremonies in US schools of pharmacy |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=1414–9 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14519030 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D124 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold-sponsored version of the WCC, or a similar rite of passage, is currently used by 97 percent of Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-accredited schools of medicine in the United States, and takes place at medical and osteopathic schools in 13 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanism-in-medicine.org/programs/rituals/white-coat-ceremony/|title=The Arnold P.
