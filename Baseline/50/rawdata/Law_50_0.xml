In [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.&lt;ref name="Wolters"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wolters-Kluwer-Bouvier-Law-Dictionary/dp/1454806117|title=The Wolters Kluwer Bouvier Law Dictionary: Desk Edition|last=Sheppard|first=Stephen Michael|date=2012-05-21|publisher=Aspen Publishers|isbn=9781454806110|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstract of title==
{{Main|Abstract of title}}
The Abstract of Title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage law|mortgages]], and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.&lt;ref name="Wolters"/&gt;

==Clear title==
{{Unreferenced section|type=Law|date=November 2007}}
A clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks{{Clarify|reason= does this mean "it shews an unbroken chain"?|date=February 2011}}in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

==Patent law==
In the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in United States patent law) of an invention. Under [[United States patent law]], the abstract may be called "Abstract of the Disclosure".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0600_608_01_b.htm 608.01(b) Abstract of the Disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; 37 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/1.72  1.72 - Title and abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative process==
Certain government bureaucracies, such as a ''department of motor vehicles'' will issue an '''abstract''' of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. This is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the course of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] [[Croatia]] harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13596/ |title=Media Freedom in Croatia (2006-2016) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Program South East Europe |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Croatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/croatia |title=Croatia. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date=2015 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/barbara-matejcic-freelance-journalist-croatia |title=”I can’t say it raised the level of general transparency” |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website= Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the improvements of the legal framework regulating access to public information, problems remain in the implementation, especially for journalists willing to request and obtain information from the government.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;
 
==Legal framework==
 
In Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=GONG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nives Miošić and Duje Prkut  |date=July 2012 |title=Access to information in Croatia: Exercise of a Constitutional Right in an Institutional Culture of Secrecy|url= https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_downloads/GONG%20(Zagreb)_Access%20to%20information%20in%20Croatia.pdf  |publisher=GONG Policy Research Center |issue= |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the '''Law on the Right to Access Information''' adopted by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2013. The Law also regulates the [[re-use of information]] held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revizija.hr/en/access-to-information/law-on-the-right-to-access-information |title=Law on the Right of Access to Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Revizija.hr |publisher=Republic of Croatia. State Audit Office |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
The Croatian law on Access to public information is  in informed by four principles:
 	
* the principle of '''publicity''' and '''free access''', meaning that information are available to any national or foreign natural persons or legal entity as established by the Law;
* the principle of '''timeliness, entirety and accuracy''' of information, meaning that information disclosed under the Law must be timely provided, complete and accurate;
* the principle of '''equality''', meaning that the right of access to information is granted to every beneficiary in an equal manner;	
* the principle of '''disposal of information''', meaning that beneficiaries that obtained the information in accordance with the Law, are entitled to disclose this information in public.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
For the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

===Restrictions to the right of access to information===
 
Public authority bodies may restrict access to information if:
 		 
* the information has been classified, in accordance with the law regulating classified information;
 
* if the information represents a trade or professional secret;
 
* in the information is a tax-related secret;
 
* is the information is protected by the law regulating the protection of personal information;
 
* the information may seriously undermine an ongoing decision-making process;
 
* the information is restricted in accordance with international treaties.
 
Moreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might  prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test===
 
The public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. [[Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test]] refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Procedures===
 
Public authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Applicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Access to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Authorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged  by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) &lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
If the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Right to appeal===
 
Against the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. 
 
No complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Re-use of information===
 
The Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 

==Access to public information in practice==
 
The Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. &lt;ref name=MySociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mysociety.org/2016/09/29/journalists-celebrate-freedom-of-information-croatia/  |title=Journalists celebrate Freedom of Information: Croatia |last= |first= |date=29 September 2016 |website=Mysociety.org |publisher=mySociety |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=MySociety/&gt;
 	
One of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.&lt;ref name=HALTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Croazia-al-di-sopra-dell-opinione-pubblica-17749 |title=Croazia: al di sopra dell'opinione pubblica |last=Gabrić |first=Toni |date=14 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|language=Italian |access-date=14 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner [[Anamarija Musa]] - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt;
 
===''Imamo pravo znati'' (“We have right to know”) platform===
 	
In Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imamopravoznati.org |title= Imamo pravo znati |last= |first= |date= |website=Imamopravoznati.org |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] but the legal framework is seriously flawed, with no law on access to information in the Southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] of the country and a law that falls below [[Council of Europe]] standards in the [[Northern Cyprus|Northern part of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is ''de facto'' divided.

As to 2011, a research by the [[Open Cyprus Project]] showed that there was a level of 75% of [[administrative silence]] island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus. Report and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information is being discussed in the Parliament of the (Southern) Republic of Cyprus. 

'''On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Northern Cyprus ==
The right to access public information is granted by Article No. 24 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus. Even if the Constitutional article echoes Article No. 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), experts say that the possibilities to restrict the fundamental right of  access to public information are provided in an overbroad manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, Article No. 10 (2) ECHR says that the conditions and restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of expression have to be “necessary in a democratic society”. Instead, even if the Constitution of Northern Cyprus- under Article No. 24- provides for a test of whether a restriction to such a right is necessary, it does not specify the key qualification of being necessary in a democratic society, as required by Article 10 of the ECHR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The relevant laws regulating the right to access public information in the Northern part of Cyprus are: the Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006; the Public Officials Law No. 7 of 1979; the State Procurement Regulation; the Rules and Procedures of the Parliament and the Personal Data Protection Act No. 89 of 2007.

The Right to Access Information Law obliges “public bodies” to process all information requests, regardless of the means by which they are submitted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2011 research recommends that, with regard to the Access to Information Law in the Northern part of the country, the scope of the law should be extended to all classes of information held by public bodies. Also, according to experts, an implementing regulation should be approved, clarifying the administrative procedure to request and receive information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the Access to Information Assessment Commission foreseen by the law has not been appointed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/nat/11269|title=Open Cyprus Project: Results|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2011|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Cyprus ==
The Cypriot government couldn't sign or ratify the 2009 [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Access to Official Documents]] as it did not have a transparency law that meets the Convention’s minimum standard. Until 2017, Cyprus was the only country in Europe, other than Luxembourg, without a law guaranteeing the right of access to information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/28182|title=Civil society warn Cyprus’ draft transparency law under threat if excessive exceptions persist|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But as of 2018, the law has been published (Law 184(I)/2017)

The relevant laws with regard to the right to access public information are the following:
* Article No. 19 and 29 of the Constitution;
* the Act regarding Personal Data N. 138 of 2001, which makes clear that this data can be accessed only by the affected person (s);
* the Act on Re-Use of Existing Information Held by Public Sector Bodies, No. 132 of 2006: it ensures that when the authority grants one user permission to make use of a large volume of information, it must grant other users access on the same  terms;
* the Press Law No. 145 o 1985: it grants a general right of access to all information held by public bodies;
* the Environmental Information Law No. 119 of 2004, which clearly grants access to information on a non- discriminatory basis;
* the State Archives Law No. 208 of 1991, for information held in archives. It does not grant a general public access before a thirty-year period;
* the State Secrets Law No. 2016 of 2002;
* the Public Service Law No. 1 of 1990;
* the Public Procurement Law No.1 of 200;
* the Public Aid Law No. 30 of 2001;
* the Administrative Principles Law No. 158 of 1999.

Since April 2014, the Republic of Cyprus has been holding public consultations aimed at drafting a Freedom of Information Law, which as to 2017 has to be enacted.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/10/18/ministry-defends-planned-freedom-of-information-law/|title=Ministry defends planned freedom of information law|last=Psyllides|first=George|date=October 18, 2015|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Cypriot Justice Minister [[Ionas Nicolaou]] expressed his commitment to adopt a strong access to information (Freedom of Information) law that will be “one of the best in the [[European Union]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/20942|title=Access Info welcomes Cyprus’ commitment to strong FOI law|last=Pavlou|first=Andreas|date=October 21, 2015|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in February 2017, the association [[Access Info Europe]] has addressed the Cypriot Parliament asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated for the removal of  the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/27727|title=Cypriot lawmakers challenged to ensure FOI is free and exceptions are limited|last=|first=|date=March 1, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/02/18/ngo-calls-foi-fees-axed/|title=NGO calls for FOI fees to be axed|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=February 18, 2017|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no [[public interest]] test.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied  requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2017, the recommendations elaborated by Access Info Europe were sent to the Cypriot Parliament Legal Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Comments_FOIlaw_cyprus_parliamentarycommittee_28feb2016.pdf|title=Σχόλια από Access Info Europe περί το νομοσχέδιο που ρυθμίζει το δικαίωμα πρόσβασης σε ληροφορίες του δημόσιου τομέα (Comments from Access Info Europe on the draft law regulating the right of access to Public Sector Information)|last=|first=|date=February 28, 2016|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|language=Greek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, [[Citizen Service Centres]] have been established all over the island in order to provide multiple services as an alternative channel for dealing with public agencies/organizations. They work through a single 4-digit number (1434) which citizens can call in order to obtain information with respect to approximately 90 services offered by the CSCs, such as eligibility criteria for submitting an application, documents that need to be submitted, fees charged etc. Through this Call Centre, citizens can also submit applications for 18 services relating to the issuing of specific documents/licenses/certificates etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/nrp2016_cyprus_en.pdf|title=EUROPE 2020- Cyprus National Reform Programme 2016|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''administration of justice''' is the process by which the [[legal system]] of a government is executed. The presumed goal of such administration is to provide [[justice]] for all those accessing the legal system. The phrase is also used commonly to describe a University degree (as in: a BA in Administration of Justice), which can be a prerequisite for a job in law enforcement or government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807231503/http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |archivedate=2016-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In ''Attorney General for New South Wales v Love'', the appellant argued that section 24 of the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 did not have the effect applying the [[Nullum Tempus Act]] (9 Geo 3 c 16) (1768) to [[New South Wales]]. Counsel for the appellant said that ''Whicker v Hume''&lt;ref&gt;Whicker v Hume (1858) 7 HL 124&lt;/ref&gt; decided that section 24 referred not to laws generally, but only to laws as to modes of procedure, and that the Nullum Tempus Act did not deal merely with procedure. The Lord Chancellor said that the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 ''prima facie'' "applied the Nullum Tempus Act to the Colony in question as much as if it had re-enacted it for that Colony." He then said:

{{Blockquote|Sect. 24 of that Act provides "that all the laws and statutes in force within the realm of England at the passing of this Act" (that is to say, the year 1828) "shall be applied in the administration of justice in the courts of New South Wales," and it is sought by construction to limit the words "all laws and statutes" by introducing into the section the words "having relation to procedure" or some equivalent expression. At least that is the only intelligible mode in which the argument can be supported, because the words which do occur in the section - "in the administration of justice" - would certainly include a limitation of the time within which actions can be brought, and their Lordships are of the opinion that the language of the section cannot be limited so as to exclude the statute, which for the reasons pointed out by the learned judges were and are so important in the administration of justice in the Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General for New South Wales v Love [1898] AC 679 at 685, [[Privy Council|PC]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==
[[Section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867]], also known as the administration of justice power, grants the provincial legislatures of Canada the authority to legislate on:
:14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.

===Ontario===
Section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1990 c A6) provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act, "administration of justice" means the provision, maintenance and operation of,
:(a) the courts of justice of the Province of Ontario,
:(b) land registry offices,

for the performance of their functions, including any functions delegated to such courts, institutions or offices or any official thereof by or under any Act; (“administration de la justice”)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a06 Digitised copy]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This provision was previously section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1980 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1982) 37 Ontario Reports 246 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj9SAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1970 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Ontario Reports 387 and 389 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEJSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act 1968 (SO 1968 c 1) (17 Eliz 2 c 1).&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Law Reform Commission.

==Republic of Ireland==
"Offence against the administration of justice" is defined by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/sec0007.html section 7] of the [[Criminal Procedure Act 2010]].

==United Kingdom==
In England, the administration of justice is a [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative]] of the [[Crown of the United Kingdom|Crown]]. It may be exercised only through duly-appointed [[Judiciary of England and Wales|judges]] and [[Courts of England and Wales|courts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following matters and things pertain to the administration of justice: the organisation of the courts; the prerogative of justice, the [[prerogative of mercy]], and any prerogative power to create new courts; [[nolle prosequi]]; the appointment, tenure and immunity of judges; the immunity of other participants in legal proceedings; [[contempt of court]]; the composition and availability of juries, any requirement that their verdict be unanimous, and the allowances they receive; the branches of the legal profession; and the provision of [[legal aid]] and advice.&lt;ref&gt;O. Hood Phillips. ''A First Book of English Law''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Chapter 2. (These matters and things are discussed by the author  in a chapter titled "The Administration of Justice").&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of justice is an act which is normally associated with the carrying on of the business of government. When a government does that act, it is thereby exercising its sovereignty. It would accordingly be a violation of British sovereignty for a foreign government to do that act in British territory without authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Sir Arnold Duncan. Legal Effects of War. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1944. Page 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]] authorises foreign service courts to exercise their jurisdiction in the United Kingdom.

There are [[offences against the administration of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. [[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. {{ISBN|0 406 00086 7}}. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone's Statutes on Criminal Law: 2004-2005. Fourteenth Edition. Part XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], the following are administration of justice offences:
*The offence of [[perverting the course of justice]]
*The offence under section 51(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]
*An offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, suborning or inciting another person to commit an offence under section 1 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/54 section 54(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of perverting the course of justice has been referred to as "interfering with the administration of justice" and as "obstructing the administration of justice".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences relating to the Administration of Justice. Working Paper No 62. HMSO. 1975. Paragraph 10 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 6(c) of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] provides that nothing in the foregoing provisions of that Act restricts liability for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended to impede or prejudice the administration of justice.

An [[arrestable offence]], other than one specified in Schedule 5 to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], was [[serious arrestable offence|serious]] for the purposes of that Act if it led to, or was intended or likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice. An arrestable offence which consisted of making a threat was serious for the purposes of that Act if carrying out the threat would be likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/116/enacted sections 116(1) to (4) and (6)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal proceedings held in public, the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]], section 4(2). Where in proceedings for any offence which is an administration of justice offence for the purposes of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]] it appears to the court that there is a possibility that (by virtue of that section) proceedings may be taken against a person for an offence of which he has been acquitted, section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 applies as if those proceedings were pending or imminent: The Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 4(2A).&lt;/ref&gt;

Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] is exempt information if its disclosure under that Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/31 section 31(1)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anarchist law''' is a hypothetical body of norms regarding behavior and decision-making that might be operative in an anarchist community. The term is used in  a series of ongoing debates within the various branches of [[anarchist]] theory regarding if and how norms of individual and/or collective behavior, [[decision-making]] and actions should be created and enforced.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
The term ''basic law'' is used in some places as an alternative to "[[constitution]]", implying it is a ''temporary but necessary measure'' without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a [[codified constitution]], or in countries with [[uncodified constitution]]s, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being "the highest law", often for religious reasons. In [[West Germany]] the term "[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]" (''Grundgesetz'') was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate [[reunification of Germany]]. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.

The [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]], namely [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]].

{{Merge|Legal citation|date=December 2017|reason=Basically duplicate articles (WP:CONTENTFORK).|discuss=Talk:Legal citation#Merge Legal citation and Case citation}}
[[File:Unitedstatesreports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[United States Reports]]'' is the official reporter of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]

'''Case citation''' is a system used by legal professionals to identify past [[court case]] decisions, either in series of books called [[Reporter (law)|reporters]] or [[law report]]s, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are formatted differently in different [[jurisdiction]]s, but generally contain the same key information.

A '''legal citation''' is a "reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2012|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-314-26578-4|edition=9th Abridged|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:
* Court that issued the decision
* Report title
* Volume number
* Page, section, or paragraph number
* Publication year

In some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square [[bracket]]s "{{bracket|year}}" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).

The Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way.  They can be found through many national and other websites, such as [[WorldLII]], that are operated by members of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

The resulting flood of unpaginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system.  This usually contains the following information:
* Year of decision
* Abbreviated title of the court
* Decision number (not the court file number)
Rather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and [[Web browser|browser]]s, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.

The conjunction "versus" is abbreviated to "v" in Commonwealth countries and to "v." in the United States.

==Pronunciation of case titles==

In [[common law]] countries with an [[adversarial system]] of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation ''v''{{mdash}}usually written as ''v'' in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and always as ''v.'' in the US. The abbreviation represents the Latin word ''versus'', which means ''against''. When case titles are read out loud, the ''v'' can be pronounced, depending on the context, as ''and'', ''against'', ''versus'', or ''vee''.&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"&gt;{{cite web|website=SOAS Library: Research Guides|title=Understanding UK Case Law|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf|author=School of Oriental and African Studies Library, University of London|pages=5–6|date=August 2012|quote=The small letter “v” is an abbreviation of versus. However, the term “and” is used to pronounce it, rather than “v” or “versus”, e.g. the case “Smith v Jones” would be pronounced “Smith and Jones”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth pronunciation===

Commonwealth countries follow British legal style:

* [[Civil law (common law)|Civil cases]] are pronounced with ''and''.  For example, ''Smith v Jones'' would be pronounced "Smith {{em|and}} Jones".&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"/&gt;
* [[Criminal law|Criminal cases]] are pronounced with ''against''.  For example, ''R v Smith'' would be pronounced "the Crown {{em|against}} Smith".&lt;ref name="soas_uk_criminal"&gt;{{cite web|website=SOAS Library: Research Guides|title=Understanding UK Case Law|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf|author=School of Oriental and African Studies Library, University of London|page=5|date=August 2012|quote=A case can be pronounced in a number of ways, e.g. “R v Smith” would be pronounced either “the Crown against Smith”, or it can be referred to as simply “Smith” }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin words ''Rex'', ''Regina'', and ''versus'' are all rendered into English.
* ''Versus'' and ''vee'' are incorrect.&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melbourne University Law Review Association|title=Australian Guide to Legal Citation|date=2010|isbn=9780646527390|page=43|edition=3rd|url=http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc|quote=In speech, the 'v' between the parties' names is rendered 'and' in a civil action and 'against' in a criminal action both in Australia and the United Kingdom. It is not pronounced 'versus' as it is in the United States of America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American pronunciation===

In the United States, there is no consensus on the pronunciation of the abbreviation ''v.''  This has led to much confusion about the pronunciation and spelling of court cases:&lt;ref name="nyt1989"&gt;{{cite news|title=On Language: Child's Garden of Vs.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/magazine/on-language-child-s-garden-of-vs.html|agency=The New York Times|date=June 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Versus'' is most commonly used,&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt; leading some newspapers to use the common abbreviation ''vs.'' in place of the legal abbreviation ''v.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=How the Airlines Became Abusive Cartels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/how-the-airlines-became-abusive-cartels.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2017|quote=Today’s auction system on oversold flights, ironically, is the stepchild of a 1976 Supreme Court case, Nader vs. Allegheny, in which the late and little lamented Allegheny Airlines (known to its long suffering passengers as Agony Airlines) picked the wrong passenger to bump.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Vee'' is also heard but is not as common.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;
* ''Against'' is a matter of personal style.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;  For example, [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] preferred to announce cases at the Supreme Court with ''against''.&lt;ref name=oyez_betamax&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1687|title=''Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.''|quote=Warren E. Burger: Before we hear the arguments in Sony Corporation against Universal City Studios ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oyez_smith&gt;{{cite web|title=''Smith v. Massachusetts''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-8661|website=Oyez|quote=John Paul Stevens: We'll hear argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''And'' is used by some law professors, but other law professors regard it as an affectation.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;

During [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), the participants demonstrated the lack of consensus by using different pronunciations of ''v.'' Solicitor General [[Ken Starr]] even managed to use all three of the most common American pronunciations interchangeably:&lt;ref name=oyez_casey&gt;{{cite web|title=''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744|website=Oyez|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=[[Ken Starr|Kenneth W. Starr]]: This is the process of analysis that is quite familiar to the Court, very lengthily laid out by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe ''versus'' Ullman, and then adumbrated in his concurring opinion in Griswold ''against'' Connecticut. ... Well, I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe ''vee'' Wade.}}

==Australia==
Legal citation in Australia generally mirrors the methods of citation used in [[England]]. A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (commonly known as AGLC), published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

The standard case citation format in Australia is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]''
| (1992)
|
| 175
| CLR
|
| 1.
|}

As in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

===Neutral citation===
Australian courts and tribunals have now adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.  Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.&lt;ref name="austlii"&gt;[http://austlii.edu.au Austlii.edu.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|HCA
|1
|}
So the above-mentioned ''Mabo'' case would then be cited like this: ''Mabo v Queensland (No 2)'' [1992] HCA 23.

There is a unique court identifier code for most courts.  The court and tribunal identifiers include:
{| class="wikitable"

==Canada==
There are a number of citation standards in Canada. Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard—formulated in ''[[The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation]]'', commonly known as the "[[McGill Guide]]" after the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', which first published it. The following format reflects this standard:

:''[[Hunter v. Southam|Hunter v Southam]]'', [1984] 2 SCR 145.

Broken into its component parts, the format is:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.|R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]'',
|
| [1985]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 295.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Oakes|R v Oakes]]'',
|
| [1986]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 103.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''Re Canada Trust Co and OHRC''
| (1990),
|
|69
|DLR
|(4th)
|321
|(Ont CA).
|}

The ''Style of Cause'' is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by ''v'' (English) or ''c'' (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.

Undisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., ''[[R. v. R.D.S|R v RDS]]''). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by ''R'' for ''Regina'' (queen) or ''Rex'' (king). [[reference question|Constitutional references]] are always entitled "''Reference re''" followed by the subject title.

If the year of decision is the same as the year of the report, and the date is a part of the reporter's citation, then the date need not be listed after the ''style of cause''. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.

Where available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the ''style of cause'' and preceding the print citation. For example,

:''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.

This format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.

The seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (".") characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent)

* Canadian Citation Committee [http://www.lexum.com/ccc-ccr/neutr/neutr.jur_en.html A Neutral Citation Standard for Case Law]

== Denmark ==
There is no official standard for case citations in Denmark, and the citation format also varies depending on how the reporter in question indexes their judgments (i.e. by page number or giving each case an identifier). However, citations usually include the same components:
* The name or abbreviation of the reporter.
* The year of the reporter.
* The page number or identifier of the case.
* The name or abbreviation of the court who heard the case.
As an example, a case from the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] (Højesteret) published in the [[Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen]], the main reporter of decisions, in the year 2001 on page 2327 could be cited in various different ways, as exemplified by this non-exhaustive list:
* UfR 2001.2327 H
* U 2001.2327 HD
* U 2001 p. 2327
* Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen 2001 p. 2327
The above example is from a reporter that cites cases by page number. Another reporter, Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, gives each case a number instead. The above case was given the identifier 719 and would be cited using 719 instead of a page number (e.g. TfS 2001/179 H or TfS 2001/179 HD, among others).{{Efn-ur|group=Denmark|name=Examples|Note how Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen can be cited both as "UfR" or simply "U". Additionally, p. (page) would be written as s. (side) in Danish. This particular example is, in part, from {{Harvnb|Madsen|2018|p=11}}}}

Cases that have not been published in a reporter should be cited using the name of the court, the date of the decision and the court's own case number. For example:
* Højesterets dom af 17. februar 2010 fra Højesteret, sag 269/2009 ([[English language|English]]: The Supreme Court's judgment of the 17th of February 2010, case 269/2009)
As with reporter citations, the composition and wording of the citation can vary, the key is to include enough information for the reader to be able to acquire it.{{Efn-ur|{{Harvnb|Madsen|2018|pp=11-12}}}}

==Germany==
{{main|German legal citation}}
In Germany there are two types of citation: the full citation of a case and its shortened form. In e.g. scientific articles, the full citation of a particular case is only used at its first occurrence; after that, its shortened form is used. In most law journals, the articles themselves only use the shortened form; the full citations for all articles sometimes are summarized at the beginning of that journals edition.

A third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the [[European Case Law Identifier]], a ″neutral″ citation system introduced by the [[Council of the European Union]] in 2011, which Germany is participating in.

===Federal Constitutional Court of Germany===
The most important cases of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] are published by the court in its official collection. This collection is abbreviated ''BVerfGE'', whereas ''BVerfG'' is short for ''Bundesverfassungsgericht'', the German court name, and ''E'' stands for ''Entscheidung'' (decision).

Starting in 2004, the court also publishes the BVerfGK collection, containing decisions made only by a ''Kammer'', a specific part of the court.

The so-called [[:de:Volkszählungsurteil|Volkszählungsurteil]] for example could be cited
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43), Urteil des Ersten Senats vom 15. Dezember 1983 auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983, Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83.

For the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see [[:de:Aktenzeichen#Verwendete Aktenzeichen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts|the German article]].

If decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,
:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).
Where ''NJW'' stands for the law journal [[:de:Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|Neue Juristische Wochenschrift]], 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) – "f." stands for "seq.". In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.

===Federal Court of Justice of Germany===
The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (Bundesgerichtshof, short BGH) publishes the official collections ''[[:de:BGHSt|BGHSt]]'' for decisions in [[penal law]] and ''[[:de:BGHZ|BGHZ]]'' for those in [[private law]].

The [[:de:Katzenkönigfall|Katzenkönigfall]] e.g. would be cited
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.
in full and
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.
in short (in this example, not a specific page but the case as such is cited; "ff." means "sqq.").

===Other federal courts===
The official collection of the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court of Germany]] (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) is abbreviated ''BSGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) is ''BFHE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]] (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) is ''BAGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) is ''BVerwGE''.

===Other courts===
For other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.

===European Case Law Identifier===
According to the [[European Case Law Identifier|ECLI]] system the ''Volkszählungsurteil'' would be cited as 
:ECLI:DE:BVerfG:1983:rs19831215.1bvr020983
and the ''Katzenkönigfall'' as 
:ECLI:DE:BGH:1988:150988U4STR352.88.0

==India==
India's vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India – subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.

===Supreme Court of India===
The  official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on ''www.courtnic.nic.in'', the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include ''Supreme Court Cases'', which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the ''Supreme Court Almanac'', and ''Judgements Today''.

[[File:All India Reporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''All India Reporter'']]

''[[Sebastian Hongray v. Union of India]]'':
* AIR 1984 SC 571 – "AIR" refers to the ''All India Reporter'', "1984" is the year of judgement (AIR does not use a volume-based classification), "SC" refers to the Supreme Court of India, and "571" is the first page number of the report within the volume;
* (1984) 1 SCC 339 – "1984" is the year of publication, "1" is the volume number of the reporter, "SCC" stands for ''Supreme Court Cases'' (the name of the reporter), and "339" is the first page number of the report within the volume; and
* 1984 Cri LJ 289 (SC) – "1984" is the year of publication, "Cri LJ" is an abbreviation for the ''Criminal Law Journal'' (the name of the reporter), and "289" is the first page number of the report within the volume. The "SC" in parentheses indicates that the case was heard by the Supreme Court.

A citation of the "Supreme Court Almanac":
* ''[[Additional Secretary, Government of India v. Alka Subhash Gadia]]'' (1990) 2 Scale 1352

A citation in "Judgements Today":
* ''[[Premium Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu]]'' JT (1994) 1 SC 374

The "Supreme Court Cases (SCC)" published supplementary reports for a few years in the early 1990s. Those citations looked like this:
* ''[[Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan]]'' 1992 Supp (2) SCC 239, which points to page 239 of the Second Supplementary Volume of the SCC reports in the year 1992. From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.

The SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:
* ''[[Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India]]'' 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports
* ''[[Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress]]'' 1991 SCC (L&amp;S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour &amp; Services Reports

===High Courts===
The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is the most popular nationwide reporter for decisions of the High Courts. An AIR High Court citation looks like: ''[[Surjya Kumar Das v. Maya Dutta]]'' AIR 1982 Cal 222, where "Cal" refers to the [[Calcutta High Court]] in [[Kolkata]]. This is a uniform style for AIR High Court reports. Only the shortened indicator of the forum changes for different High Courts. ''The Calcutta Weekly Notes'' is the oldest continuously published [[law journal]] in India having uninterrupted publication since 1896 reporting reportable decisions of the High Court at Calcutta. Reports are cited in the style 105 CWN 345 where 105 refers to the volume number calculated at one volume per year from the initial volume, which had been published in 1896. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]])===

National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]]) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research &amp; Reference System (JRRS) – JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.

The Citation nomenclature followed within [[NJRS]] :
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

This Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

==New Zealand==
The standard case citation format in New Zealand is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of reporter]
! volume
! reporter
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board''

| NZLR
| 394
|- valign="top"
|  ''R v Howse''
| (2005)
|
| 21
| CRNZ
| 823
|}

Several leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (AGLC) such as the ''[[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]] Law Review''. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.

===Reporters===
{| class="wikitable"

|}

Additionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Neutral citation===
New Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|NZSC
|1
|}

There is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal.  These identifiers are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Court Identifier
!Court
!Years
|- valign="top"
|NZSC
|[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]
| 2005–
|- valign="top"
|NZCA

| NZEnvC
|[[Environment Court of New Zealand]]
| 2010–
|- valign="top"
| NZFC
|[[Family Court of New Zealand]]
| 2012–
|}

Where both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. ''R v AM'' [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750

==Norway==
The Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:

:Rt. 1952 s. 989 ''(Telefonsjikanedommen)''

where:

* '''Rt.''' identifies the report series.
** All [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court judgments]] are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.
** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).
* '''1952''' is the year of reporter
* '''s.''' is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.
* '''989''' is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.
* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. ''Telefonsjikanedommen'' refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment ("telefonsjikane") was not illegal under the current criminal code.

==The Philippines==
Despite the long-standing [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which report of a case is relied on by the person citing that case. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Official reporter===
The ''Philippine Reports'' is the official reporter of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The standard format for citation of the ''Philippine Reports'' is:

:''People v. Flores'', 442 Phil. 561 (2002)

where:

* ''People v. Flores'' is the name of the case
* ''442'' is the volume number of the ''Philippine Reports'' where the case may be found
* ''Phil.'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Philippine Reports''
* ''561'' is the page number in the ''Philippine Reports'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''442 Phil. 561, 563''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found
* ''(2002)'' is the year the case was decided.

As of present, Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues. The Supreme Court Reports Annotated or SCRA are cited as such:

Juarez v. Court of Appeals 214 SCRA 475

where 214 is the volume of the book, and 475 is the page number. There are already over 700 SCRAs in circulation.

===Unofficial reporter===
In the last few decades, the ''Philippine Reports'' has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the ''Philippine Reports'', even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' is:

:''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1998, 289 SCRA 624

where:

* ''Fortich v. Corona'' is the name of the case
* ''G.R. No. 131457'' is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. means ''General Register'')
* ''24 April 1998'' is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated
* ''289'' is the volume number of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' where the case may be found
* ''SCRA'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated''
* ''624'' is the page number in the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''289 SCRA 624, 627''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found

Owing to the delays in the regular publication of the Philippine Reports, reliance on the SCRA has been tolerated, although if a case may be found at the Philippine Reports, it is preferred that the official reporter be cited in lieu of the SCRA.

When citing cases not yet reported in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA, the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., ''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1988)

===Lower court decisions===
As there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: ''(case name)'', ''(docket number)'', ''(Exact date of promulgation of decision)''.

==Switzerland==
Citations vary by court and by language. Cases of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] are cited as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schweizerisches Bundesgericht - Zitierregeln|url=https://www.bger.ch/index/juridiction/jurisdiction-inherit-template/jurisdiction-zitierregeln.htm|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially published cases are cited as ''BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]'' (German: ''Bundesgerichtsentscheide'') or ''ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]'' (French: ''arrêts du tribunal fédéral''). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, "E. 3.2" and "S. 296" are the section and page specifically cited.

Supreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as ''Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. März 2007'' or ''arrêt [du Tribunal fédéral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007'' respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.

The citation style for cases of the inferior [[federal courts of Switzerland]] is similar.

==United Kingdom==

===Neutral citation===
{{main|British and Irish Legal Information Institute#Case citations}}
Since 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).
	
Neutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, &lt;br /&gt;''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20 &lt;br/&gt;identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).

===How to cite a case===
{{see also|Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities}}
If a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the ''best report'', which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases – AC, Chancery – Ch, Family – Fam, Queen's Bench – QB etc.).

The case of ''Rottman v MPC'' was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.

This means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.

To cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].

If a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., ''Rottman v MPC'' was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.

For cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' judgment:

*''Donoghue v Stevenson'' [1932] AC 562, 573.
*See [http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities]

===England and Wales===
The standard case citation format in [[England and Wales]] is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''
|
| [1932]
| 
| AC
|
| 562
| (HL).
|-valign="top"
|''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''
|(1884)
|
|14
|QBD
|
|273.
|
|}

In [[England and Wales]] as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation "R" for ''rex'' (king) or ''regina'' (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or [[judicial review]] cases).

[[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|Square brackets]] "[ ]" are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either—as with ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', above—do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.).  [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|Round brackets]] "( )" are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', above.

===Law Reports===
The term "reporter", meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)

Two main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the ''Weekly Law Reports'' (WLR) and the ''All England Reports'' (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., ''Entertainment and Media Law Reports'' (EMLR) or the ''Criminal Appeal Reports'' (Cr App R).

For the citation of "The Law Reports" of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see [[Law Reports]]. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen's Bench (QB) (or King's Bench—KB—depending on the monarch of the time). These four series are cited in preference to all others in court.

Generally, the first name (here, ''Roe'') is the surname of the [[plaintiff]], who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the [[appellant]], the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the [[petitioner]] when litigating in the [[Supreme court|high court]] of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, ''Wade'') is the surname of the [[defendant]], the party responding to the suit, or the [[appellee]], the party responding to the appeal, or the [[respondent]], when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, ''Roe'' refers to "[[Jane Roe]]," a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and ''Wade'' refers to [[Henry Wade]], the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney at the time.
*410 is the volume number of the "[[Reporter (law)|reporter]]" that reported the Court's written opinion in the case titled ''Roe v. Wade''.
*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, "U.S." stands for ''[[United States Reports]]''.
*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of ''United States Reports'') where the opinion begins.
*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.
*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West [[National Reporter System]], publish opinions originating from multiple courts.  In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in ''United States Reports'') and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.

Case citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.

This format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Miller v. California]]'' would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
Cases from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are officially printed in the ''[[United States Reports]]''. A citation to the ''United States Reports'' looks like this:

*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
*''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

Many court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a "parallel citation". For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the [[National Reporter System|''Supreme Court Reporter'']] (abbreviated S.&amp;nbsp;Ct.) and ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition'' (commonly known simply as ''Lawyers' Edition'') (abbreviated L.&amp;nbsp;Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:

*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)

The "2d" after the L.&amp;nbsp;Ed. signifies the second series of the ''Lawyers' Edition''. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a "2d" is appended after the reporter's abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.

Some very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The "(1 Cranch)" refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the ''United States Reports'' compiled by the Supreme Court's [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]], cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court's Reporter of Decisions. In this example, ''Marbury'' was first reported in an edition by [[William Cranch]], who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called "[[nominative reports]]", existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the ''United States Reports'', and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, "5 U.S. (1&amp;nbsp;Cranch)" means that it is the 5th overall volume of the ''United States Reports'' series, but the first that was originally published by [[William Cranch]]; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] (for example, "4 U.S. (4 Dall.)"), and after Cranch's 9 volumes, 12 more were published by [[Henry Wheaton]] (e.g., "15 U.S. (2&amp;nbsp;Wheat.)"). See the [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions]] for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the ''United States Reports''.

When a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', {{nowrap|565 U.S. ___ (2012)}}.

In the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal.  In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court.  This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.

===Lower federal courts===
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]
[[United States court of appeals]] cases are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (F., F.2d, or F.3d). [[United States district court]] cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by [[Thomson West]]; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the ''de facto'' "official" reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the [[D.C. Circuit]], has an official reporter, ''United States Court of Appeals Reports'', and even that one is rarely used today.)&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1 provides: "Citations to decisions of this court must be to the Federal Reporter. Dual or parallel citation of cases is not required."&lt;/ref&gt;

When lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:

*''[[Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School]]'', 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) – a 1993 case in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]
*''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'', 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) – a 2002 case in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]]

U.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in [[Federal Cases]], abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).

===State courts===
State court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state's courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state's highest court are abbreviated the same as the state's name (note: this is the traditional abbreviation, not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is.  Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the [[California Supreme Court]] (titled ''California Reports'') is abbreviated "Cal." (or, for subsequent series, "Cal. 2d," "Cal. 3d", or "Cal. 4th").

*''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], reported in ''New York Reports''. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Green v. [[Chicago Tribune]] Company'', 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) – a case in the [[Illinois Appellate Court]], reported in ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports''. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the [[List of state intermediate appellate courts|intermediate court of appeals]] in Illinois; decisions of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] are reported in ''Illinois Reports'', abbreviated "Ill." (or "Ill. 2d"). Because the ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports'' are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Harte v. Hand'', 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]] are published in the ''New Jersey Superior Court Reports'', the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of ''Harte v. Hand'', 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).

[[File:National Reporter System regions.png|thumb|400px|right|The [[Thomson West]] National Reporter System regions.]]
In addition to the official reporters, [[Thomson West]] publishes several series of "regional reporters" that cover several states each. These are the ''[[North Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Atlantic Reporter]]'', ''[[South Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Southern Reporter]]'', ''[[South Western Reporter]]'', ''[[North Western Reporter]]'', and ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''. [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, ''West's California Reporter'', ''Illinois Decisions'', and ''West's New York Supplement'').  Some smaller states (like [[South Dakota]]) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their "official" reporter.

Here are some examples of how to cite West reporters:

*''Jackson v. Commonwealth'', 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) – a case in the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate appellate court) published in the ''South Eastern Reporter'''s 2nd series
*''Foxworth v. Maddox'', 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) – a case in the [[Florida Supreme Court]] published in the ''Southern Reporter''
*''People v. Brown'', 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) – a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (New York's highest court) published in  ''West's New York Supplement'''s 2nd series. The case also appears in West's regional reporter: ''People v. Brown'', 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that "N.Y." is placed in the parenthetical, because both ''West's New York Supplement'' and the ''North Eastern Reporter'' report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, ''People v. Brown'', 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.

Abbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state's system.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Like the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the [[reporter of decisions]], a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in ''Hall v. Bell'', 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of ''Massachusetts Reports'', which, like ''United States Reports'', was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; "6 Met." refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by [[Theron Metcalf]]. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is ''[[Pierson v. Post]]'', 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of ''Caines' Reports'', page 175, named for [[George Caines]], who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but [[Delaware]] persisted until 1920.

Some states, notably [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/New_Styman.htm "New York Law Reports Style Manual"]&lt;/ref&gt; In California, the year is placed ''between'' the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped by in [[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|bracket]]s instead of [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Either way, both state styles differ from the national/[[Bluebook]] style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.

For example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the ''Brown'' case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:

*(''People v. Brown'', 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).

And, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous ''Greenman'' [[product liability]] case would be cited to a California court as:

*(''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 C2d 57&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unpublished decisions===
{{main|Non-publication}}
A growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters.  For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the [[California Court of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]]) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding information overload.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmier v. Supreme Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/78CA4t703.htm 78 Cal. App. 4th 703] (2000). The plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully challenged the selective publication policy as unconstitutional. The court retorted: "Appellant either misunderstands or ignores the realities of the intermediate appellate process." The court went on to describe the variety of frivolous appeals regularly encountered by the Courts of Appeal, and concluded: "Our typical opinions in such cases add nothing to the body of stare decisis, and if published would merely clutter overcrowded library shelves and databases with information utterly useless to anyone other than the actual litigants therein and complicate the search for meaningful precedent."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad [[precedent]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Attorneys have several options in citing "unpublished" decisions:
* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not ''yet'' been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case's docket number before the court that decided it is required.
**''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.'', No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) – a decision of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).
* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered "published" (those appearing in ''Federal Reporter''), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered "unpublished" in a separate publication called ''Federal Appendix'' (abbreviated "F. App'x").
* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often "published" on computer services, such as [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]]. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case's [[docket (court)|docket]] number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:
**''[[Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie]]'', No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) – a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).
**''[[Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n]]'', No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) – a case decided by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).

Some court systems—such as the [[California]] state [[Judiciary of California|court system]] and the federal [[United States courts of appeals|Court of Appeals]] for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuits]]—forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in [[Kentucky]], unpublished cases from that state's courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and "there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court".  From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.

===Vendor-neutral citations===
With the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites.  Some were published while others never lost their "unpublished" status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as [[West Publishing]] claimed a copyright interest.

A vendor-neutral citation movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions AALL Citation Formats Committee]; accessed May 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases "published" on the web.

An example of a vendor-neutral citation:
*''[[Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati]]'', 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) – a 1997 case decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court ("1997 FED App. 0318P") eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor's product, in this case [[West (publisher)|Thomson West]]'s ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).

===Pinpoint citations===
In practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, "pin cites", or "jump cites".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.law.tulane.edu/content.php?pid=209935&amp;sid=5027306 Using Pinpoints], Tulane University Law School, Legal Citation Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in ''Roe v. Wade'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word "person" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.  That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the ''Roe'' decision was published.  A full pin cite to ''Roe'' for that holding would be as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).

And a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).

But in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court's opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites.  Therefore, a citation to ''Roe v. Wade'' in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).

Even then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by [[Bryan A. Garner]], one of the leading authors on [[legal writing]] and style. Most judges do relegate ''some'' citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and Judge [[Richard Posner]] refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.

===Types of citations===
There are two types of citations: proprietary and [[public domain]] citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called ''[[The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', compiled by the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. ''Public domain citations'' refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">'''Engineering law''' (or law in engineering) is the [[empirical]] study of the application of [[laws]] and legal [[strategy]] in [[engineering]]. Applied law aims to explain how [[law]] interacts with [[industry]]. The current [[school of thought]] within the academic community of [[lawyers]] and [[engineers]] is the [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] [[paradigm]]. Commonly, professionals have a [[Bachelors in Engineering]] and a [[Bachelors in Law]], and increasingly commonly a [[Masters of Business Administration]]. Pragmatic application of [[laws]] means the [[empirical]] study of how a [[corporate]] legal framework should be adopted.

== Graduate attributes and professional competencies == 
The requirements from the  perspective of the Washington Accord are for engineering graduates to attain the following knowledge and skill: 
'WA6: Apply reasoning informed by contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to professional engineering practice and solutions to complex engineering problems.'

== Sub topics ==
Key topic areas for engineering law are: 
* Contract administration, especially in construction, procurement, and supply chain. 
* Product liability, especially for manufactured products.
* Intellectual property (IP) protection, which includes patents, copyrights, etc.
* Safety legislation and regulations, which includes plant safety, risk management, food safety. 
* Standards and certification, which are product-specific constraints on design and testing processes.
Patent Law, which are to help people do patent on any goods.

'''European Dactyloscopy''' ('''Eurodac''') is the [[European Union]] (EU) [[fingerprint]] database for identifying [[asylum seekers]] and irregular border-crossers. Asylum applicants and irregular border-crossers over the age of 14 have their fingerprints taken as a matter of [[EU law]]. These are then sent in digitally to a central unit at the [[European Commission]], and automatically checked against other prints on the database. This enables authorities to determine whether asylum seekers have already applied for asylum in another [[EU member state]] or have illegally transited through another EU member state ("principle of first contact"). The [[Automated fingerprint identification|Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] is the first of its kind on the European Union level and has been operating since 15 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/key_issues/eurodac/eurodac_20_09_04_en.pdf EURODAC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412084934/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/key_issues/eurodac/eurodac_20_09_04_en.pdf |date=2007-04-12 }} "Information and communication" unit, Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security, B-1049 Brussels – August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; All EU member states currently participate in the scheme, plus three additional European countries: Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.

{{global|date=April 2012}}
'''Excusable negligence''' is a [[paradox]]ical phrase, since if the failure to exercise [[Duty of care|reasonable care]] under the circumstances is excusable, there is no [[negligence]]. 38 Am J1st Negl § 12.  As used in statutes authorizing the opening of a default and allowing a party to defend [[on the merits]], the standard set by courts is slippery to define, but cases seem to agree that a reasonable excuse is sufficient, where it appears that the defense is meritorious and no substantial prejudice will result from setting aside the default.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''Expert determination''' is a historically accepted form of [[dispute resolution]] invoked when there is not a ''formulated dispute'' in which the parties have defined positions that need to be subjected to [[arbitration]], but rather both parties are in agreement that there is a need for an evaluation. Expert determination is a procedure by which the parties to a dispute appoint an independent and neutral expert to determine the dispute in private. Like arbitration, it allows trade secrets and other sensitive information to be kept out of the public domain. The expert will be a person with specialist or technical knowledge relevant to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.bwbllp.com/Files/Publications/GuideToExpertDetermination.pdf Bates Wells &amp; Braithewaite's Guide to Expert Determination Advocates for International Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice itself is well established where complex legal institutions either have not developed, or are unavailable, such as tribal societies and criminal organisations.

In the context of modern jurisprudence, the word "expert" appears first in ''Bottomley v Ambler'' 1878 38 LT 545, this was however used ambiguously also referring to arbitrators having the qualification of expert. The first mention that distinguishes specifically against the practise of arbitration, and introduces the formula "''as an expert and not as an arbitrator''" was in ''Dean v. Prince'' 1953 Ch. 590 at 591 (misquoted) and subsequently on appeal in the year 1954 1 Ch. 409 at 415. In [[Contract Law]], the [[party (law)|parties]] are free to include a [[forum selection clause]] appointing a [[special referee]] to resolve specialised but disputed factual issues between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">A '''form book''' is a tool used by [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to aid in the filing of [[pleading]]s, [[Motion (legal)|motions]] and other [[legal document]]s with a [[court]] or similar decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Forms|url=https://law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/legalforms/|website=Duke Law|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form book may be a bound volume or binder containing loose-leaf pages, containing forms, clauses and model documents that the attorney might use when preparing a legal document or court pleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunsch|first1=Kelly|title=Drafting Legal Documents: A Resource Guide|url=https://lib.law.washington.edu/btg/2001/drafting.htm|website=Seattle University Law Library|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Due to the exacting nature of legal forms and the time and effort required to prepare legal documents, form books were created as an aid in the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics Of Court Forms And Filings|url=http://www.civillawselfhelpcenter.org/self-help/getting-started/48-basics-of-court-forms-and-filings|website=Civil Self-Help Center|publisher=Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These books conserve time and serve as a reference to attorneys and law students seeking to use them in their practice. The importance of these books is not to be underestimated, as a form lacking proper language or information may jeopardize court proceedings.

Forms can contain standard language to be used in court proceedings, or may more closely resemble a template which is to be filled in based on case specifics. Forms found in form books are often used as a reference, as the document that will be used must be tailored specifically to the court and situation in which it will be presented.  In some cases, such as [[patents|patent]] and [[bankruptcy]], certain forms are legally required.&lt;ref name="dukeformbk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Forms|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/formbks|website=Duke Law|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form books may be arranged chronologically, alphabetically, by subject, or by [[jurisdiction]]. They may also include additional resources such as outlines, research references, annotations, state considerations, and law practice checklists in addition to the forms.

The style, format, and information required in court documents differs from one jurisdiction to another, between different levels of courts in a system, and between different areas of law. Therefore, the companies that publish [[casebooks|casebook]] and other legal materials often publish form books as well, offering selections specific to the location and type of practice in which their customers are engaged. Many publishers offer the forms in their books on computer discs. Some books may be accompanied by CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs.

The advent of the [[Internet]] has lessened demand for printed form books. Many forms are now distributed freely by various courts, and others are available for free or online purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Finding Free Legal Forms Online - And Using Them Safely|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/research/legal_forms.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Catey|title=Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=MarketWatch|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms online may be offered with drafting tools and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FYI: Document Assembly|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/docassembly.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Form Books==
There are several different categories of form books available. These differ in their organization, subject, and the nature of the information contained.

===General Form Books===
General form books usually fall into one of two categories: transactional, or covering pleading and practice processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use Form Books|url=http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/FORMBooks.pdf|website=Cooley Law School|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517065143/http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/FORMBooks.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional (or legal) forms give examples of [[contract]]s, [[Will (law)|wills]], [[lease]]s, [[deed]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgages]], and other substantive matters. Pleading and practice forms provide formatting and examples for legal language to be used in various court motions such as complaints, answers, and motions to dismiss. General form books are not state specific, and are annotated and cross-referenced. They are usually arranged alphabetically or encyclopedically and may provide a topical index to aid researchers in finding specific forms.

===Form Books for Specific Subjects or Proceedings===
Publishers can provide form books that discuss a specific type of practice. Topics which might have their own form books include [[real estate]], [[business law]], and [[taxes|tax]].

===Form Books Specific to Geographic Jurisdictions===
Most states have form books containing state-specific forms. These can be published by various entities such as state courts or individual [[state bar|state bar association]] organizations. Other court systems may publish their own materials as well.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Forms|url=http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/?page_id=456|website=Florida Southern District Court|publisher=U.S. Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Types of Form Books===
Another type of form book is designed for those seeking legal forms but not trained as lawyers, commonly referred to as a “self-help” form book.&lt;ref name="dukeformbk"/&gt; Topics included could be leases, wills, and contracts.

==Topics Covered in Form Books==
Typical forms included in a form book are a model [[complaint]], [[answer (law)|answer]], motion to compel [[Discovery (law)|discovery]], motion for [[summary judgment]], and request for permission to [[appeal]]. Other types of forms include:
Transactional forms used to draft wills, contracts, and documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=Elizabeth|title=Form Books|url=http://guide.library.law.emory.edu/practicing_attorney|website=Hugh F. McMillan Law Library|publisher=Emory Law|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], freedom of choice is the freedom of [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] to allocate their [[resources]] as they see fit, among the options (such as goods, services, or assets) that are available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Robert E. |authorlink1=Robert Hall (economist) |last2=Lieberman |first2=Marc |title=Microeconomics: Principles &amp; Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR9uvGmChp8C |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location= |isbn=9781439038970 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pagoso|first1=Cristobal M. |last2=Dinio |first2=Rosemary P. |last3=Villasis |first3=George A.|title=Introductory Microeconomics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8Der6qyzaUC |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |year=1994 |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc. |location= |isbn=9789712315404 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the freedom to engage in employment available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quizlet.com/3805244/microeconomics-chapter-04-the-market-system-flash-cards/ |title=Quizlet Microeconomics, Chapter 04 – The Market System |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratner et al., in 2008, cited the literature on [[libertarian paternalism]] which states that consumers do not always act in their own best interests. They attribute this phenomenon to factors such as emotion, cognitive limitations and biases, and incomplete information which they state may be remedied by various proposed interventions.  They discuss providing consumers with information and decision tools, organizing and restricting their market options, and tapping emotions and managing expectations. Each of these, they state, could improve consumers' ability to choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = R.

However, [[economic freedom]] to choose ultimately depends upon [[market competition]], since buyers' available options are usually the result of various factors controlled by sellers, such as overall [[Quality (business)|quality]] of a product or a service and [[Advertising|advertisement]]. In the event that a [[monopoly]] exists, the consumer no longer has the freedom to choose to buy from a different producer. As [[Friedrich Hayek]] pointed out:
{{quote|text=Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to another. But if we face a monopolist we are at his absolute mercy.|sign=[[Friedrich Hayek]]|source=''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', "Can planning free us from care?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QyQwvLDLycC|accessdate=February 15, 2013|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As shown in the above quote, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] thinkers are often strong advocates for increasing freedom of choice. One example of this is [[Milton Friedman]]'s ''[[Free to Choose]]'' book and TV series.

There is no consensus as to whether an increase in economic freedom of choice leads to an increase in happiness. In one study, [[the Heritage Foundation]]'s 2011 [[Index of Economic Freedom]] report showed a strong correlation between its [[Index of Economic Freedom]] and happiness in a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Sebastiano Bavetta |author2=Pietro Navarra |date=2011|title=Index of Economic Freedom|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/download|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|pages=61–68|chapter=5|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring freedom of choice ==
The [[Axiomatic system|axiomatic]]-[[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] approach has been used to address the issue of measuring the amount of freedom of choice (FoC) an individual enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dowding|first1=Keith|authorlink1=Keith Dowding|last2=van Hees|first2=Martin|authorlink2=Martin van Hees|title=Oxford Handbook of Individual and Social Choice|url=http://www.rug.nl/staff/martin.van.hees/2009handb.pdf|accessdate=February 15, 2013|year=2009|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|chapter=Chapter 15 – Freedom of Choice|pages=374–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanaik | first1 = Prasanta K. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Yongsheng | author-link1 = Prasanta Pattanaik | title = On ranking opportunity sets in terms of freedom of choice | journal = Recherches Économiques de Louvain / Louvain Economic Review | volume = 56 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 383–90 | publisher = Department of Economics, Universite Catholique de Louvain via JSTOR | jstor = 40723933 | date = 1990 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Xu | first = Yongsheng | title = On ranking linear budget sets in terms of freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 281–89 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0287-x | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0287-x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prasanta Pattanaik|Prasanta K. Pattanaik]] and Yongsheng Xu presented three conditions that a measurement of FoC should satisfy:
#''Indifference between no-choice situations''. Having only one option amounts to the same FoC, no matter what the option is.
#''Strict monotonicity''. Having two distinct options x and y amounts to more FoC than having only the option x.
#''Independence''. If a situation A has more FoC than B, by adding a new option x to both (not contained in A or B), A will still have more FoC than B.
They proved that the [[cardinality]] is the only measurement that satisfies these axioms, what they observed to be counter-intuitive and suggestive that one or more axioms should be reformulated. They illustrated this with the example of the option set "to travel by train" or "to travel by car", that should yield more FoC than the option set "to travel by red car" or "to travel by blue car". Some suggestions have been made to solve this problem, by reformulating the axioms, usually including concepts of [[preference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sen | first1 = Amartya | author-link1 = Amartya Sen | title = Welfare, preference and freedom | journal = Journal of Econometrics | volume = 50 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 15–29 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/0304-4076(91)90087-T | date = October 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4076(91)90087-T | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanaik | first1 = Prasanta K. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Yongsheng | author-link1 = Prasanta Pattanaik | title = On preference and freedom | journal = Theory and Decision | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–98 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1023/A:1004924211553 | date = April 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004924211553 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sugden | first = Robert | title = The metric of opportunity | journal = Economics and Philosophy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–37 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S0266267100003874 | date = October 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266267100003874 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rejecting the third axiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Carter | first = Ian | title = Choice, freedom, and freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–81 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | quote = an explication of freedom of choice should reject the third axiom | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with happiness ==
A 2006 study by Simona Botti and Ann L. McGill showed that, when subjects were presented with differentiated options and had the freedom to choose between them, their choice enhanced their satisfaction with positive and dissatisfaction with negative outcomes, relative to nonchoosers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Botti|first1=Simona|last2=McGill|first2=Ann L.|year=2006|title=When Choosing is Not Deciding: The Effect Of Perceived Responsibility on Satisfaction|journal= Journal of Consumer Research|volume=33|ssrn=1516287|accessdate=|doi=10.1086/506302|pages=211–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] compiled a list of experiments about freedom of choice and argued that "too much choice can produce a paralyzing uncertainty, depression, and selfishness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H.

Schwarts had written a book and given speeches criticizing the excess of options in modern society, though acknowledging that "some choice is better than none".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartz|first=Barry|title=The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less|year=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=0060005696|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html|title=The paradox of choice|last1=Schwartz|first1=Barry|date=July 2005|work=Talk|publisher=TED|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''Freedom of contract''' is the freedom of private or public individuals and groups (of any legal entity) to form nonviolent contracts without [[Economic regulation|government restrictions]].  This is opposed to government restrictions such as [[minimum wage|minimum-]] or [[maximum wage|maximum-wage laws]], [[competition laws]], [[economic sanctions]], restrictions on [[price fixing]], or restrictions on contracting with [[second-class citizens]] or [[undocumented workers]].  The freedom to contract is the underpinning of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and is a cornerstone of [[Free market|free-market]] [[libertarianism]].  Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general [[freedom of choice|freedom to choose]] with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.

==History==
[[Henry James Sumner Maine]] proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from [[social status]] to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by [[Robert Nozick]], sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a "[[night-watchman state|minimal state]]."

==United States==
===''Lochner v. New York''===
{{Main|Lochner v. New York}}
In 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to "due process." Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] used the [[due process clause]] to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]] wrote for the majority: "Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment."

Writing in dissent, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] accused the majority of basing its decision on [[laissez-faire]] ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that "Liberty of Contract" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution.

===Afterward===
In his "Liberty of Contract" (1909), [[Roscoe Pound]] critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were "simply wrong" from the standpoint of common law and "even from that of a sane individualism" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of [[usury]] and that the two were "of the same type" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such "academic" and "artificial" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a "lost respect for the courts" but predicted a "bright" future for labor legislation (486-487).&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe Pound, "Liberty of Contract," 18 Yale Law Journal 454 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''. In that case the court upheld a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] law setting a [[minimum wage]].

==United Kingdom==
In the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused "freedom of contract" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in ''[[Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1875) 19 Eq 462, 465, regarding freedom of contract and patents&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir George Jessel MR]]. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In ''[[George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd]]'', [[Lord Denning MR]] compared "freedom of contract" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.

{{quote|''The heyday of freedom of contract''

None of you nowadays will remember the trouble we had – when I was called to the Bar – with exemption clauses. They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of "freedom of contract". But the freedom was all on the side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket or order form or invoice. The big concern said, "Take it or leave it." The little man had no option but to take it. The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, "You must put it in clear words", the big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption clauses or understand them.

It was a bleak winter for our law of contract. It is illustrated by two cases, ''[[Thompson v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Co.]]'' [1930] 1 K.B. 41 (in which there was exemption from liability, not on the ticket, but only in small print at the back of the timetable, and the company were held not liable) and ''[[L'Estrange v. F. Graucob Ltd.]]'' [1934] 2 K.B. 394 (in which there was complete exemption in small print at the bottom of the order form, and the company were held not liable).

''The secret weapon''

Faced with this abuse of power – by the strong against the weak – by the use of the small print of the conditions – the judges did what they could to put a curb upon it. They still had before them the idol, "freedom of contract". They still knelt down and worshipped it, but they concealed under their cloaks a secret weapon. They used it to stab the idol in the back. This weapon was called "the true construction of the contract". They used it with great skill and ingenuity. They used it so as to depart from the natural meaning of the words of the exemption clause and to put upon them a strained and unnatural construction. In case after case, they said that the words were not strong enough to give the big concern exemption from liability; or that in the circumstances the big concern was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause. If a ship deviated from the contractual voyage, the owner could not rely on the exemption clause. If a warehouseman stored the goods in the wrong warehouse, he could not pray in aid the limitation clause. If the seller supplied goods different in kind from those contracted for, he could not rely on any exemption from liability. If a shipowner delivered goods to a person without production of the bill of lading, he could not escape responsibility by reference to an exemption clause. In short, whenever the wide words – in their natural meaning – would give rise to an unreasonable result, the judges either rejected them as repugnant to the main purpose of the contract, or else cut them down to size in order to produce a reasonable result. This is illustrated by these cases in the House of Lords: ''[[Glynn v. Margetson &amp; Co.]]'' [1893] A.C. 351; ''[[London and North Western Railway Co. v. Neilson]]'' [1922] 2 A.C. 263; ''[[Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Buerger]]'' [1927] A.C. 1; and by ''[[Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King]]'' [1952] A.C. 192 and ''[[Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd. v. Rambler Cycle Co. Ltd.]]'' [1959] A.C. 576 in the Privy Council; and innumerable cases in the Court of Appeal, culminating in ''[[Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Cleaning Co. Ltd.]]'' [1978] Q.B. 69. But when the clause was itself reasonable and gave rise to a reasonable result, the judges upheld it; at any rate, when the clause did not exclude liability entirely but only limited it to a reasonable amount. So where goods were deposited in a cloakroom or sent to a laundry for cleaning, it was quite reasonable for the company to limit their liability to a reasonable amount, having regard to the small charge made for the service. These are illustrated by ''[[Gibaud v. Great Eastern Railway Co.]]'' [1921] 2 K.B. 426; ''[[Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd]]'' [1945] K.B. 189 and ''[[Gillespie Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd. v Roy Bowles Transport Ltd.]]'' [1973] Q.B. 400.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Geojurisprudence''' is "a [[system]]ic approach to the connections of [[legal science]] to [[geography]] and [[geopolitics]]" ([[Manfred Langhans-Ratzeburg]] - ''Begriff und Aufgaben der Geographischen Rechtswissenshaft (Geojurisprudenz)'' published by Kurt Vowinkel in 1928 as a companion volume to [[Karl Haushofer]]'s ''Zeitschrift für Geopolitik'' (ZfG).

Haushofer opened the topic in his essay "Geopolitik und Geojurisprudenz" which appeared in ''Zeitschrift für Völkerrecht'' in 1928. Here he lamented the lack of geographical understanding in [[Germany|German]] legal studies. 

He said this contributed towards the general failure of the German populace to understand the nature of the [[First World War]]. He heralded Langhans-Ratzeburg as the chief representative of this new discipline, which he suggested would overcome the "thin, sterile air of legal scientific concepts and the fraudulent, political scientific, treaty-waving political posture of the so-called central powers". 

With a return to putatively "German" concepts of legal relations between states, invigorated by incorporating a geographical perspective, then borders as durable legal structures rooted in geography would emerge.

With this introduction, ''Langhans-Ratzeburg'' in turn praised not only Haushofer, but also [[Alfred Hettner]], [[Walther Vogel]] and [[Albert von Hoffmann]] for their attempts to link geography, history, politics and culture.

(2011). Defining information policy. Journal of Information Policy 1-5. http://jip.vmhost.psu.edu/ojs/index.php/jip/article/view/19/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are [[public policy]] issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as [[intellectual property]], economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, [[information security]], access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.

== Overview ==

Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.”&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Marilyn Gell. (1983). The federal role in library and information services. White Plains, N.Y.: Knowledge Industry Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”

Information policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including [[information sciences|information science]], [[economics]], law, and public policy.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M. W. (1995) Information Policies: premonitions and prospects. Journal of Information Science 21(4) 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s.  The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations.  The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies.  Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/braman/www/bramanpdfs/027_Braman_Chapt1.pdf |title=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |publisher=Pantherfile.uwm.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.

Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the [[United Kingdom]] Ministry of Information was established in the [[World War I|First World War]] to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.

In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.

== Types and importance ==

The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories.  It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science.  It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology.  More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks).  As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation.  Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA ([[Stop Online Piracy Act]]).  Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

1. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss);

2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management
 
3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information

4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments

== Issues ==

There are some issues around organizational information policies,&lt;ref&gt;Orna Elizabeth, Information Policies, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Journal of Information Science, 34 (4) 2008, pp 547-565, apud N. Moore and J. Steel, Information-Intensive Britain. British Library R &amp; D report No. 6038 (The Policy Studies Institute/British Library Board, London, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.

== Convergence==
Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"&gt;(Garcia-Murillo and MacInnes, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks.  Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt; As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.

Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;(Stanchak, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.

In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"&gt;(Reisinger, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]]. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"/&gt; For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;(Houck, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.

The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by [[privacy law]]s. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt;

== Internet governance ==

Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"&gt;Solum, 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"/&gt;

Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"&gt;(Solum, 2008, 68)&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"/&gt; It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.
 
Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 48)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.

== Government roles ==

Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, M. (1997) The Field of Information Policy: 1. Fundamental Concepts, Journal of Information Science 23(4) 261-275&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

=== Security vs freedom of information ===

A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information.  Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties.  The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include:&lt;ref name=EPIC&gt;{{cite web|title=USA PATRIOT Act|url=http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Electronic Communications Privacy Act(ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress.  Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]] rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.

== Research methods and tools ==

The five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:

Classification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.

Identification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).

Reductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. 
Forecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is [[PEST analysis|STEEP framework]]. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.

Process-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.

== The future ==

In regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T.J. (1994). Rights in Conflict: public policy in an information age. In: New Worlds in Information and Documentation : Proceedings of the 46th FID Conference and Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field.  As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;  It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of [[Web 2.0]] nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.

In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).

Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009).  The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011).  As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009).  The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).

An '''inquest''' is a judicial inquiry in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, particularly one held to determine the [[cause of death|cause of a person's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inquest|title=Definition of INQUEST|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducted by a [[judge]], [[jury]], or government official, an inquest may or may not require an [[autopsy]] carried out by a [[coroner]] or [[medical examiner]]. Generally, inquests are conducted only when deaths are sudden or unexplained. An inquest may be called at the behest of a [[coroner]], [[judge]], [[prosecutor]], or, in some jurisdictions, upon a formal request from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.municode.com/HTML/16214/level2/TIT2ADPE_CH2.12CO.html#TIT2ADPE_CH2.12CO_2.12.080INUTPR|title=Municode Library|author=|date=|website=library.municode.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''[[coroner's jury]]''' may be convened to assist in this type of proceeding.  ''Inquest'' can also mean such a jury and the result of such an investigation. In general usage, ''inquest'' is also used to mean any investigation or inquiry.

An inquest uses witnesses, but suspects are not permitted to defend themselves. The [[verdict]] can be, for example, natural death, accidental death, misadventure, suicide, or murder. If the verdict is murder or culpable accident, [[Criminal law|criminal prosecution]] may follow, and suspects are able to defend themselves there.

Since juries are not used in most [[Europe]]an [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, these do not have any (jury) procedure similar to an inquest, but medical evidence and professional witnesses have been used in court in continental Europe for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/71/I0157100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905155355/http://bartleby.com/61/71/I0157100.html |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/in/inquest.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907224703/http://bartleby.com/65/in/inquest.html |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

Larger inquests can be held into [[disaster]]s, or in some [[jurisdiction]]s (not [[Inquest (England and Wales)|England and Wales]]) into cases of [[political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;[Anon.] (2001) "Inquest", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Deluxe CDROM edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''inquest''', as a means of settling a matter of fact, developed in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Carolingian Empire]] before the end of the tenth century.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite book | author=Baker, J. H. | title=An Introduction to English Legal History | edition=4th | pages=''pp''72–73 | location=London | publisher=Butterworths | isbn=0-406-93053-8 | year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the method of gathering the survey data for the [[Domesday Book]] in [[England]] after the [[Norman conquest]].&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt;  In his account of the culture of the Gauls (Commentarii de bello Gallico VI.19.3), Julius Caesar mentions a very early use of the procedure: "if a matter comes into suspicion about a death, they hold an inquiry (a ''quaestio'') concerning the wives in the method used for slaves, and if guilt is established, they kill the wives, who have been tortured, with fire and all torments."

==Inquests by region==

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Inquest (England and Wales)}}

'''In England and Wales''', all inquests were once conducted with a jury. They acted somewhat like a [[grand jury]], determining whether a person should be committed to trial in connection to a death. Such a jury was made up of up to twenty-three men, and required the votes of twelve to render a decision. Similar to a grand jury, a coroner's jury merely accused, it did not [[convict]].

Since 1927, coroner's juries have rarely been used in England. Under the Coroners Act 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1988/ukpga_19880013_en_1.html#pb3-l1g8 |title = Coroners Act 1988, s 8(3) | publisher = [[BAILII]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a jury is only required to be convened in cases where the death occurred in prison, police custody, or in circumstances which may affect public health or safety. The coroner can actually choose to convene a jury in any investigation, but in practice this is rare. The qualifications to sit on a coroner's jury are the same as those to sit on a jury in [[Crown Court]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], and the [[county court]]s.&lt;ref name="kcl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/coroners/jury.html|title=King's College of London - Coroner's Law Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a coroner's jury only determines cause of death, its ruling does not commit a person to trial. While grand juries, which did have the power to indict, were abolished in the United Kingdom by 1948 (after being effectively stopped in 1933), coroner's juries retained those powers until the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]]. This change came about after [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] was charged in 1975 by a coroner's jury in the death of Sandra Rivett, his children's nanny.&lt;ref name="kcl" /&gt;

The charity [[Inquest (charity)|INQUEST]] looks at inquest's concerning contentious deaths including those in places of detention, and has campaigned for reforms to the inquest and coroner's system in England and Wales.

There are no inquests or Coroners '''in [[Scotland]],''' where sudden unnatural deaths are reported to, and investigated on behalf of, the [[Procurator Fiscal]] for an area. The Procurator Fiscal has a duty to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexpected and unexplained deaths and any death occurring in circumstances that give rise to serious public concern. Where a death is reported, the Procurator Fiscal will investigate the circumstances of the death, attempt to find out the cause of the death and consider whether criminal proceedings or a [[Fatal Accident Inquiry]] is appropriate. In the majority of cases reported to the Procurator Fiscal, early enquiries rule out suspicious circumstances and establish that the death was due to natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2006/04/12094440/4|title=What to do after a death in Scotland: ... practical advice for times of bereavement - 8th Edition|first=St Andrew's House|last=Scottish Government|date=27 April 2006|website=gov.scot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaths are usually brought to the attention of the Procurator Fiscal through reports from the police, the Registrar, GPs or hospital doctors. However, anyone who has concerns about the circumstances of a death can report it to the Procurator Fiscal. There are certain categories of deaths that must be enquired into, but the Procurator Fiscal may enquire into any death brought to his notice.

===United States===
In the United States, inquests are generally conducted by coroners, who are generally officials of a [[County (United States)|county]] or [[city]].&lt;ref&gt;18 [[C.J.S.]] ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' §§ 1, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; These inquests are not themselves trials, but investigations. Depending on the state, they may be characterized as [[Legal case|judicial]], [[Quasi-judicial proceedings|quasi-judicial]], or non-judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests, and the necessity for holding them, are matters of statutory law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes may also regulate the requirement for summoning and swearing a coroner's jury.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests themselves generally are public proceedings, though the accused may not be entitled to attend.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Coroners may compel witnesses to attend and give testimony at inquires, and may punish a witness for refusing to testify according to statute.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Coroners are generally not bound by the jury's conclusion, and have broad discretion, which in many jurisdictions cannot be appealed. The effect of a coroner's verdict at [[common law]] was equivalent to a finding by a [[grand jury]], whereas some statutes provide that a verdict makes the accused liable for arrest.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the county or city is responsible for the fees of conducting an inquest, but some statutes have provided for the recovery of such costs.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the evidence presented at an inquest can be used in subsequent [[Lawsuit|civil actions]] depends on the jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 24.&lt;/ref&gt; though at common law, the inquest verdict was admissible to show cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S.

{{forms of government}}

An '''interregnum''' (plural '''interregna''' or '''interregnums''') is a period of discontinuity or "gap" in a government, organization, or social order. Archetypally, it was the period of time between the reign of one monarch and the next (coming from Latin ''inter-'', "between" and ''rēgnum'', "reign" [from ''rex, rēgis'', "king"]), and the concepts of interregnum and [[Regent|regency]] therefore overlap. Historically, the longer and heavier interregna were typically accompanied by widespread unrest, [[Civil war|civil]] and [[War of succession|succession wars]] between [[warlord]]s, and [[power vacuum]]s filled by foreign invasions or the emergence of a new power. A [[failed state]] is usually in interregnum.

The term also refers to the periods between the election of a new parliament and the establishment of a new government from that parliament in parliamentary democracies, usually ones that employ some form of proportional representation that allows small parties to elect significant numbers, requiring time for negotiations to form a government. In the UK, Canada and other "[[first past the post]]" electoral systems, this period is usually very brief, except in the rare occurrence of a [[hung parliament]] as occurred both [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|in the UK]] in 2017 and [[Australian federal election, 2010|in Australia]] in 2010. In parliamentary interregnums, the previous government usually stands as a [[caretaker government]] until the new government is established.

Similarly, in some [[Christianity#Denominations|Christian denominations]], “interregnum” (interim) describes the time between vacancy and appointment of [[Priest#Christianity|priest]] or [[pastor]]s to various roles. Additionally, the term has been applied to the period of time between the election of a new [[President of the United States]] and his or her inauguration, during which the outgoing president remains in power, but as a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000477723 On the Way Out: Interregnum Presidential Activity]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical periods of interregnum==
Particular historical periods known as interregna include:
* The period of 206–202 BC in China, after the death of the final [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] emperor, when there was a contest to the throne. It ended with the accession of [[Liu Bang]], ushering in the [[Han dynasty]].
* The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] (235–284) in the [[Roman Empire]], when it was split into multiple realms and chaos (invasion, civil war, [[Plague of Cyprian|Cyprian Plague]], and [[economic depression]]) was a constant threat until [[Aurelian]] and [[Diocletian]] restored the empire.
* The ten-year period from 574/575 to 584/585 in the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], known as the [[Rule of the Dukes]].
* The [[Sasanian civil war of 628-632|Sasanian Interregnum]] (628–632), a conflict that broke out after the death of [[Khosrau II]] between the Sasanian nobles of different factions.
* The 1022–1072 period in Ireland, between the death of [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] and the accession of [[Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain]], is sometimes regarded as an interregnum, as the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship]] of Ireland was disputed throughout these decades. The interregnum may even have extended to 1121, when [[Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair]] acceded to the title.
* From 1097 to 1102 in the [[Croatia]], between death of king [[Petar Svačić]] and when [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]], [[king of Hungary]] is crowned [[king of Croatia]] in 1102.
* From 13 April 1204 to 25 July 1261 in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Following the [[Sack of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Byzantine Empire was dissolved, to be replaced by [[Frankokratia|several Crusader states]] and [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|several Byzantine states]].  It was re-established by Nicean general [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] who placed [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] back on the throne of a united Byzantine Empire.
* From 21 May 1254 to 29 September 1273, The [[Interregnum (HRE)|Great Interregnum]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the deposition of the last [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] by [[Pope Innocent IV]] and the death of his son King [[Conrad IV of Germany]] until the [[Imperial election of 1273|election]] of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] scion [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph]] as ''[[King of the Romans|Rex Romanorum]]''.
* [[List of Scottish monarchs#First Interregnum (1290–1292)|First Interregnum]] in Scotland, which lasted from either 19 March 1286 or 26 September 1290 until 17 November 1292.  The exact dating of the interregnum depends on whether the uncrowned [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] was officially queen before her death in 1290.  It lasted until [[John Balliol]] was crowned King of Scots.
* [[List of Scottish monarchs#Second Interregnum (1296–1306)|Second Interregnum]] in Scotland, from 10 July 1296, when John Balliol was deposed, until 25 March 1306, when [[Robert the Bruce]] was crowned.
* From 14 January 1301 until 1308 in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the extinction of the [[Árpád dynasty]] and when [[Charles I of Hungary]] secured the throne for himself against several pretenders.
* From 5 June 1316 to 15 November 1316 in [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], between the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] and the birth of his posthumous son [[John I of France|John I]].
* From 2 August 1332 until 21 June 1340 in [[Denmark]] when the country was mortgaged to a few German counts.
* The [[1383–1385 Crisis|Portuguese Interregnum]], from 22 October 1383 until 6 April 1385, a result of the succession crisis caused by the death of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] without a legitimate heir.
* The [[Ottoman Interregnum]], from 8 March 1403 until 1413, a result of the death of Sultan [[Bayezid I]] at the hands of Central Asian warlord [[Timur]]. A period of civil war ensued as none of Bayezid's sons could establish primacy. The crisis was resolved when one of his sons, [[Mehmed I|Mehmed]], defeated and killed his brothers and reestablished the Empire.
* From 20 January 1410 to 1412 in the [[Crown of Aragon|Kingdom of Aragon]]. The death of King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin]] without heir led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war, resolved ultimately by the [[Compromise of Caspe]].
* The 1453–1456 period of civil war in [[Kingdom of Majapahit]] (now in [[Java (island)|Java]], Indonesia)
* From 1481 until 1483 in the [[Kingdom of Norway]], during a conflict over the succession of [[John, King of Denmark|John]], during the period of the [[Kalmar Union]]. The Norwegian Council of the Realm initially refused to accept the hereditary succession of John; as they asserted that Norway was an elective monarchy. When no serious opposition candidate emerged, the Council relented and elected John. There was also a interregnum from 1533 to 1537, after the dead of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] and the interregnum ended with a [[coup d'état]] by his son [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]].
* From 6 April 1490 to 15 July 1490 in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the death of [[Matthias Corvinus]] and election of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]].
* The [[Time of Troubles]] in Russia (1598–1613) between the [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Romanov]] dynasties.
* The [[Interregnum (1649–1660)]], a republican period in the three kingdoms of [[Interregnum (England)|England]], [[Interregnum (Ireland)|Ireland]] and [[Interregnum (Scotland)|Scotland]]. Government was carried out by the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and the [[the Protectorate|Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and before the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]
* A second English interregnum occurred between 23 December 1688, when [[James II of England|James II]] was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the installation of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as joint sovereigns on 13 February 1689 pursuant to the [[Declaration of Right]].
* [[French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies]] between 1806 and 1815. The period of [[First French Empire|French]] and followed by [[British Empire|British]] rules on the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The French ruled between 1806 and 1811. The British took over for 1811 to 1815, and transferred its control back to the Dutch in 1815.
* The brief [[Russian interregnum of 1825]], caused by uncertainty over who succeeded the deceased Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], only lasted between 1 December and 26 December 1825, but was used to stage the highly resonant [[Decembrist revolt]].

In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an ''interregnum'' is usually avoided due to a rule described as "[[The King is dead. Long live the King]]", i.e. the [[heir to the throne]] becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death or [[abdication]]. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of [[sovereignty]], attached to a personal form of power named ''[[Auctoritas]]''. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with [[coronation]] or some other formal or traditional event. In the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] who served as an [[interrex]] (ruler between kings). In [[Belgium]] the heir only becomes king upon swearing before the [[parliament]].

==Christianity==

===[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]===
A ''Papal interregnum'' occurs upon the death or resignation of the [[Pope]], though this is generally known as a ''[[sede vacante]]'' (literally "when the seat is vacant"). The interregnum ends immediately upon [[Papal election|election]] of a new Pope by the [[College of Cardinals]].

===Anglicanism===
"Interregnum" is the term used in the [[Anglican Communion]] to describe the period before a new [[parish priest]] is appointed to fill a vacancy. During an interregnum, the administration of the [[parish]] is the responsibility of the [[churchwarden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchwardens.com/duties.html |title=Responsibilities and Duties of the Churchwarden |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.churchwardens.com |publisher= |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]===
When the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] dies, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)| First Presidency]] is dissolved and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] becomes the Church's presiding body. Any members of the First Presidency who were formerly members of the Twelve rejoin that quorum. The period between the death of the President and the reorganization of the First Presidency is known as an "Apostolic Interregnum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Carrie A. |date=2008-01-30 |title= LDS leadership succession plan well-established |url= https://www.deseretnews.com/article/695248535/LDS-leadership-succession-plan-well-established.html |work=[[Deseret News]] |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==
[[FIDE]], the world [[Sports governing body|governing body]] of international [[chess]] competition, has had two [[Interregnum of World Chess Champions|Interregnum periods]] of having no chess champions, both during the 1940s.

===Men===
* 1946–1948 — [[List of World Chess Championships|Men's World Chess Champion]] [[Alexander Alekhine]] died of natural causes in 1946. Interregnum lasted until 1948, when [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] won a FIDE-held chess tournament to decide on a successor.

===Women===
* 1944–1950 — [[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Chess Champion]] [[Vera Menchik]] killed in an [[airstrike|air-raid]] during [[World War II]] in Britain in 1944. Interregnum lasted until 1950, when [[Lyudmila Rudenko]] won a FIDE-held chess tournament to decide on a successor.

==In fiction==
* The events of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation Trilogy]]'' take place during the galactic interregnum in his Foundation Universe, taking place in the [[Far future in science fiction and popular culture|25th millennium]]. [[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]] begins at the end of the Galactic Empire and notes in the novels from the [[Encyclopedia Galactica]] imply that a Second Galactic Empire follows the 1000 year interregnum.

* In [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien]]'s works, the disappearance of the King [[Eärnur]] of [[Gondor]] is followed by a 968-year interregnum (the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] years).

* ''[[The Old Kingdom Trilogy]]'' takes place after 200 years of interregnum, where the reigning Queen and her two daughters were murdered by [[Kerrigor]], 180 years of regency first and 20 years of anarchy following the death of the last Regent.

* The [[Steven Brust#The Dragaeran books|''Vlad Taltos'' series]] is set in a fantastical world of magic, at a time directly following a 250-year interregnum wherein traditional sorcery was impossible due to the orb being destroyed.

* In the world of the ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'', there was an Interregnum in the Second Era when the Second Cyrodillic Empire collapsed. It led to just over four centuries of bickering between small kingdoms and petty states. The Interregnum ended when Tiber Septim, or Talos, formed the Third Empire after a decade of war.

* In ''[[Poland (novel)|Poland]]'' by [[James A. Michener]], 1983, an historical novel that spent 38 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller List, interregnum is mentioned numerous times in the ever-shifting power struggles that plagued that country, even up to the 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8199">The '''legal system of [[Azerbaijan]]''' is based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html Azerbaijan], [[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the country was a [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]] until 1991, its legal history has also been influenced heavily by [[socialist law]]. However, after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan became independent by enactment of the constitutional act of national independence on October 18, 1991. 
&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/Meqaleler/Fikrat_Mammadov_e11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan started reformation of the legal system by the establishing of democratic reforms. This was followed by the adoption of the first [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] in 1995 which is the foundation of the legislative system of the modern country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Azerbaijan.html#_1._The_Legal_System%20of%20the%20Republic&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] creates the system of presidential republic with a [[separation of powers]] among the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government in order to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;ghttp://azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Constitution/doc/constitution_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
The term civil law in Azerbaijan refers to [[private law]], which is opposed to the [[common law]] system of [[Criminal law]] and [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]]. The major body of statutes and laws governing civil law and procedure are set out in the Civil Code of Azerbaijan, established in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azpromo.az/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==
The current Criminal Code of Azerbaijan came into force in September 2000, replacing the older Criminal Code of 1960 which had been based on the principles of [[Soviet law]].&lt;ref name="llex1"&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#legislative%20system The Basic Structure of the Azerbaijan Legislative System]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the Criminal Code states that "the Criminal legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan consists of this Code. New laws defining criminal responsibility are subject to inclusion in this Code";&lt;ref name="llex1"/&gt; this is characteristic of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems such as [[France]] and [[Italy]]. In 1998 Azerbaijan was the first country in the Orient to abolish the [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"/&gt;

==Sources of law==
Unlike [[common law]] systems such as the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], Azerbaijani courts do not rely extensively on [[case law]] and judicial [[precedent]]. Except for decisions of the [[Constitutional Court]] of Azerbaijan, decisions of the courts are not usually counted as a source of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#case%20law Case Law in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of law in the Azerbaijani legal system are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#sources%20of%20law Sources of Azerbaijani law]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].
*Acts adopted via [[referendum]].
*[[Laws]] passed by the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]], Azerbaijan's [[legislature]].
*[[Decree]]s.
*Resolutions of the [[Cabinet of Ministers]].
*International [[treaties]] to which Azerbaijan is a party.

==Court system==
The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of Azerbaijan is a supreme judicial body on civil, criminal and other cases related to the execution of general and specialized courts. The [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan]] is the supreme body of constitutional justice on the matters attributed to its jurisdiction by the Constitution, with authority to interpret and apply the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].

The 1995 constitution provides for public trials in most cases, the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, and a defendant’s right to legal counsel. Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal. In practice, however, the courts are politically oriented, seeming to overlook the government’s human rights violations. In July 1993, [[Heydar Aliyev]] ousted the Supreme Court chief justice because of alleged political loyalties to the opposition. The president directly appoints lower level judges. The president also appoints the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court judges with confirmation by the legislature. Prosecutors (procurators) are appointed by the president with confirmation by the legislature. The [[minister of justice]] organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and republic levels. The constitution provides equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts, but in practice the arrest and investigatory powers of the prosecutors have dominant influence before the courts. Judges will often remand a case for further prosecutory investigation rather than render an innocent verdict. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than on gathering evidence.

The Azerbaijan [[Government of Azerbaijan|government’s]] [[human rights]] record is poor, although some public policy debate is allowed and human rights organizations operate. The government restricts freedom of assembly, religion, and association. Numerous cases of arbitrary arrest, beatings (some resulting in deaths), unwarranted searches and seizures, and other human rights abuses are reported. Political oppositionists are harassed and arrested, and there are dozens of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. The conflict between  [[Armenia]]ns and Azerbaijanis contributed to widespread human rights violations by both sides. Some opposition newspapers are allowed to exist.

== Legal Reforms ==
{{Main|Legal reform in Azerbaijan}}
After gaining of independence Azerbaijani legal system has undergone fundamental reforms. An important part of the legal reforms in the country is related to adoption of a new Constitution in Azerbaijan in 1995. Since that Constitution was amended three times in 2002, 2009 and 2016.  Adoption of the Constitution has been followed by reforms related to progressive legislative acts such as, "The Law on Constitutional court", "The Law on Courts and Judges", "The Law on Police", "The Law on Operational-investigational activity", Law Judicial Legal Council, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes and etc. Moreover, there have been made a number of amendements to the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/e_mehkeme_ve_huquq.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal reforms introduced new three stage - first instance, appelate and supreme court system in Azerbaijan and ensured its independence from other branches of power. At present, there are district (city) courts acts as the first degree of jurisdictional courts, military courts and local administrative-economic courts as territorial jurisdictional courts, also Court of Azerbaijan Republic on Felonies and Court of Azerbaijan on Grave Military Crimes.

The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan Republic is cassation degree of jurisdiction and consists of 4 chambers - Civil Chamber, Criminal Chamber, Military Chamber and Administrative-Economic Chamber. Court hearings are public, and defendants are free to choose their own attorney and have the right to appeal the verdict. In cases involving national security or other defined by law a judge may decide to hold a closed trial.

Azerbaijan as a member of the Council of Europe ratificated [[European Convention on Human Rights]] . Further, Azerbaijani ''individuals, group of individuals and non-governmental organisations'' can refer cases to the ECHR.

'''''Legal Education and the Reproduction of Hierarchy: A Polemic Against the System''''' is an essay by [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] on legal education in the United States of America. The work is a critique of American legal education and argues that legal education reinforces class, race, and gender inequality.

==Publication history==
The article was first self-published as a pamphlet in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://duncankennedy.net/documents/Photo%20articles/LEHR_Introduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet was subsequently reviewed in several major law journals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5763">{{for|the racehorse|Legal Case}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

{{Legal education in the United States}}
A '''legal clinic''' (also '''law clinic''' or '''law school clinic''') is a [[law school]] program providing hands-on-legal experience to law school students and [[Legal aid|services]] to various clients.  Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition,'' "clinical legal studies," (St. Paul, Minn: West Publishing Co., 1990), 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal clinics typically do ''[[pro bono]]'' work in a particular area, providing free legal services to clients.

A legal clinic or law clinic is a nonprofit law practice serving the public interest. Legal clinics originated as a method of practical teaching of law school students, but today they encompass also free [[legal aid]] with no academic links.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yakasai, "Meaning of a Legal Clinic',2016&lt;/ref&gt; There are practice-based law clinics with no academic link which provide hands-on skills to lawyers, judges and non-lawyers on practical ethical dimensions of the law at the same time offer free public defence legal services.&lt;ref&gt;International organizations,lextern web,2017(https://www.lexternweb.org/international-organizations)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need and importance==
According to Avani Bansal, In cases where parties cannot afford a [[lawyer]] and are provided legal services by the state, the quality of that legal representation is often questionable. Therefore the need for clinical legal education, or establishing [[legal aid]] clinics at law schools, where law students can provide [[legal advice]] to indigent people.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bansal|first1=Avani|title=Clinical legal education as a means to means to advance to advance access to justice in India|url=http://www.livelaw.in/clinical-legal-education-means-advance-access-justice-india/ Part 1 &amp; Part 2|website=livelaw.in|publisher=livelaw.in|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals, objectives &amp; Methods ==
Students typically provide assistance with research, drafting legal arguments, and meeting with clients. In many cases, one of the clinic's professors will show up for [[oral argument]] before the Court. However, many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Local Rules Of The United States District Courts For The Eastern, Middle, And Western Districts Of Louisiana, LR83.2.13, {{cite web |url=http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703173017/http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Areas of service==
[[File:Legal clinic - case files.JPG|thumb|Legal clinic - case files at [[Palacký University]] Faculty of Law Legal Clinic]]
Clinical legal studies exist in diverse areas such as immigration law, [[environmental law]], intellectual property, housing, criminal defense, criminal prosecution, American Indian law, human rights and international criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uu.nl/legalclinic "404 - Universiteit Utrecht", University Utrecht School of Law Clinical Programme on Conflict, Human Rights and International Justice], retrieved March 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinics sometimes sue big companies and government entities, which has led to pushback in courts and legislatures, including attempts to put limits on whom clinics can sue without losing state subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/us/04lawschool.html?hp|title=School Law Clinics Face a Backlash|last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=April 3, 2010|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Pro Bono Net===
[[Pro Bono Net]] are online [[Legal aid]] services, in some cases supported by legal clinics.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
While in many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;, in some countries like India law students are still studying at law schools, they cannot represent the clients in courts by themselves.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt; 

According to Avani Bansal in many law schools, clinical legal education is imparted without the support of practical component and lacks policy. Participation in many of these legal clinics lacks academic credits. Lack of resources, lack of trained faculty for the purpose, lack of involvement of [[Bar council|Bar Council]] Members leads to ineffective and weak clinical legal education in countries like India. Communities around are not informed so are not involved. All these aspects frustrate the effective purpose of the Legal clinic in the sense that it neither trains students in practice nor it reaches to the public.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27519">'''Legal informatics''' is an area within [[information science]]. Erdelez and O'Hare (1997) define legal informatics as follows:

:The [[American Library Association]] defines [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] as "the study of the [[structure]] and [[properties]] of [[information]], as well as the application of [[technology]] to the [[Categorization|organization]], [[archive|storage]], [[information retrieval|retrieval]], and dissemination of information." Legal informatics therefore, pertains to the application of informatics within the context of the legal environment and as such involves [[law]]-related [[organization]]s (e.g., law offices, [[court]]s, and [[law school]]s) and [[User (computing)|user]]s of information and [[information technology|information technologies]] within these organizations.

==Delivery of legal services==
Advances in [[technology]] and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a "bespoke" product created by a professional [[Lawyer|attorney]] on an individual basis for each client.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"&gt;Richard Susskind, From Bespoke to Commodity, LEGAL TECH. J., 2006, at 4, 4–7. {{cite web |url=http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/21/51/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129134550/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk//content//view//21//51// |archivedate=2011-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt; Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt;

===Cloud computing and legal services===
The widespread introduction of [[cloud computing]] provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the [[Software as a Service]] model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.
* Software as a service is much more [[scalable]]. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer.
* Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work.
* Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer.

Software as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for [[attorney-client privilege]].  The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be [[Privilege (evidence)|legally privileged]].&lt;ref name="Johnsonarticle"&gt;Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV. J.L. &amp; TECH.259, 279 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latent markets===
Because the traditional model for delivery services demanded all legal work to be done in a bespoke manner the supply of legal services is generally [[inelastic]]. Households that are ineligible for [[legal aid]] but are not able to easily afford bespoke legal services are effectively underserved by the traditional model. A report by the [[American Bar Association]] Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services found that "among moderate-income households, 39% used the legal system to attempt resolution of their legal problems, 23% attempted resolution without legal help, and 26% took no action."&lt;ref name="DeliveryReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/delivery/deltech.html|title=Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services - Standing Committee / Delivery of Legal Services|author=|date=|work=abanet.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New organizations seek to access this under-served [[latent market]] by using technology to reduce prices and make services more available.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[FindLaw]] started its online legal information service, where users can search lawyers, discuss legal topics in open forum, and purchase legal forms. In 1999, [[LegalMatch]] started its online legal matching service, where users answer questions online, LegalMatch identify the service required and notifies relevant lawyers, and users receives responses from the lawyers and can decide whom to hire. In 2001, [[LegalZoom]] started its online legal documentation service.  At LegalZoom, users can create legal documents for personal and business use by answering a questionnaire online and purchase the completed document.  In 2008, [[Rocket Lawyer]] started its online legal service, where users can receive legal documentation service and the on-call service to consult lawyers for personal and business needs at monthly or annual subscription fee. In 2012, [[Shake (company)|Shake]] started its mobile legal documentation service, with which users can create simple legal agreements via a mobile app.

====Japan====
In 2005, Taichiro Motoe, an attorney at law qualified in Japan, founded Authense Group, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.authense.co.jp&lt;/ref&gt; and started its online legal service, Bengoshi.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bengo4.com|title=弁護士ドットコム-無料法律相談・弁護士/法律相談事務所検索ポータル|author=|date=|work=bengo4.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Bengoshi.com, users can search lawyers, ask legal questions and receive answers from lawyers in open forum, request estimate for attorney fees, and consult lawyers for personal and business needs.

===Regulatory barriers to delivery of legal services===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}
Currently available legal technologies and processes cannot be implemented due to various regulations on the practice of law put into place by [[state bar association]]s and state statutes. There is controversy over whether these regulations remain in place due to economic interests by attorneys or out of genuine concern for potential harms to customers. Regulations which pose obstacles to widespread adoption of new legal technologies and processes include [[Unauthorized practice of law#Unauthorized practice of law|unauthorized practice of law]] statutes, ethical rules restricting alternative business structures for law firms, and professional rules which make practicing law in multiple jurisdictions difficult.

====Unauthorized practice of law====
{{Main|Unauthorized_practice_of_law#Unauthorized_practice_of_law}}
[[Layperson|Lay]] organizations seeking to provide legal services must be careful to avoid committing unauthorized practice of law or face exposure to litigation from consumers and regulators. The definition of what constitutes unauthorized practice of law is nebulous and has been criticized as a potentially [[unconstitutional]] restriction on free speech.&lt;ref name="LanctotArticle"&gt;Catherine J Lanctot, "Does LegalZoom have First Amendment Rights? Some Thoughts About Freedom of Speech and the Unauthorized Practice of Law", Villanova Univ. Sch. of L. Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Working Paper No. 2011-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative business structures====
{{main|Law_firm#Restrictions_on_ownership_interests}}
In the United States a complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been adopted by the [[American Bar Association]] as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] and has been codified in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer.html Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/selling_law_on_an_open_market/ |title=Selling Law on an Open Market |first=Jason |last=Krause |publisher=''[[ABA Journal]]'' |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}} See also: [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter's notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; except the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/rules_of_professional_conduct/amended_rules/rule_five/rule05_04.cfm Rule 5.4 of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these rules, law firms face additional difficulties in raising equity capital to finance development of their own legal technologies and additional regulatory requirements compared to layperson organizations. Outside of the United States there are several countries which have allowed nonlawyer ownership of law firms ranging from limitations on percentage ownership combined with a "fit to own" test&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"&gt;ABA Commission on Ethics 20/20, Memorandum Re: For Comment: Issues Paper Concerning Alternative Business Structures, 17-19 (April 5, 2011)[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ethics_2020/abs_issues_paper.authcheckdam.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (as in the [[United Kingdom]]) to allowing passive equity investment in law firms&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"/&gt; (as in [[Australia]]).

====Multijurisdictional practice====
Rule 5.5 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] requires that attorneys who maintain a "systematic and continuous practice" in a jurisdiction be admitted to practice in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="ModelRule5.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_5_unauthorized_practice_of_law_multijurisdictional_practice_of_law.html|title=Rule 5.5: Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law - The Center for Professional Responsibility|author=|date=|work=americanbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For law firms that wish to provide legal services over online delivery platforms, this phrase is unclear as to what types of activities within a state require licensing in that state.&lt;ref name="KimbroSlice"&gt;Staphanie L. Kimbro, Regulatory Barriers to the Growth of Multijurisdictional Virtual Law Firms and Potential First Steps to Their Removal, 13 N.C.J.L. &amp; TECH. ON. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This difficulty is especially acute for [[virtual law firm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Use of technology for legal access==

===Access to legal information===
From the mid-1990s onwards, lawyers, developers and publishers began to make the law available via the world wide web. Particularly influential{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} was the [[Free Access to Law Movement]] which by 2014 had 54 national and regional member organizations. In 2002, FALM adopted the Declaration on Free Access to Law. The goal of the movement has been to ensure that legal information is freely available to everyone. The declaration declared public legal information to be the common heritage of mankind.

The member organizations of FALM, primarily through the Internet, engaged in widespread publication of primary and secondary legal information. Early examples include the [[Legal Information Institute]] at Cornell University Law School and the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] based at the University of Technology and the University of New South Wales. The latter involved early adoption of hypertext technology to represent laws as a network of nodes, each representing a section.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Legal_Information_Institutes.htm Legal_Information_Institutes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/austlii/articles/libs_paper.html|title=AustLII - Publications: AustLII - Libs Paper|author=|date=|work=austlii.edu.au|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work of the open access to law movement is now published through the ''Journal of Open Access to Law'', which was established in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ojs.law.cornell.edu/index.php/joal|title=Journal of Open Access to Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the movement provided a catalyst for increasing official open access publication of legal information online by government agencies themselves.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"/&gt;

===Access to justice===
Lawyers, designers, and computers scientists have considered ways to use technology to improve non-lawyers' access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;See CodeX Techindex. Stanford Law School, n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://techindex.law.stanford.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT's) Institute of Design and the [[Chicago–Kent College of Law|Chicago-Kent College of Law]] collaborated on a multi-year redesign of self-represented litigants' court experience. Their 2002 report documented their investigation of current assistance systems, creation of a new design protocol, and plan for a new system design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/Documents/Institutes%20and%20Centers/CAJT/access-to-justice-meeting-the-needs.pdf Charles L. Owen, Edward B. Pedwell, and Ronald W. Staudt, "Access to Justice: Meeting the Needs of Self-Represented Litigants", 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also puts forward a number of concept designs, reimagining how the court system may work and people may access it. Some of their proposals include:
* "CourtNet", a network inside the court building, to link together judicial staff and the public;
* "Interactive Translator", a software tool that can be used in interviewing and court exchanges, able to translate verbal and text communications into different languages;
* "Archetypes", a diagnosis platform that models users' legal problems, classifies them, and offers referral services; 
* "Pursuit Evaluator", an online tool to allow potential litigants evaluate whether pursuing a case would be worth their time, money, and effort
* "Complaint Formulator", an electronic interface to let litigants extract data from their problem situation and assemble it into various legal documents;
* "Informer", software that uses sample cases to help litigants model their own forms and teaches them how to file correctly; and
* "Case Tracker", an interactive searchable archive of a litigant's case history, that provides a clear timeline and reference to past actions.

The [[Berkman Center]] at Harvard Law School has been working with Massachusetts housing court judge Dina Fein to design access to civil justice in the state for pro se litigants, low-income people, litigants who aren't proficient in English, and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/6853|title=Technology and Access to Justice - Berkman Klein Center|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, hosts projects such as [[Legal.io]] and [[Ravel Law]], addressing the application of legal informatics to access to justice issues, and convenes a community bringing researchers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and technologists together to work side-by-side to advance the frontier of legal technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/|title=CodeX {{!}} Stanford Law School|last=School|first=Stanford Law|website=Stanford Law School|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and policy==
Law and policy issues in legal informatics stem from the use of informational technologies in the implementation of law, such as the use of [[subpoenas]] for information found in email, search queries, and social networks. Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world; for example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolin | first1 = Ron A | year = | title = Search Query Privacy: The Problem of Anonymization | url = | journal = Hastings Science &amp; Technology Law Journal | volume = 2010 | issue = | page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital rights management and copyright law===
Copyright holders make use of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology to limit the use and distribution of digital content. In the United States, the [[anti-circumvention]] provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) criminalizes attempts to circumvent DRM, even in cases where the circumvention is merely to facilitate non-infringing uses of the content. Along with the anti-circumvention provision, DRM can override substantive rights, such as [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the Public Library Ethos: Copyright, E-Licensing, and the Future of Librarianship". William M. Cross. ''Law Library Journal'' Vol. 104:2 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal informatics in legal practice===
Within the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbar.org/about/communications/nc-lawyer/2012-nc-lawyer-editions/may-2012/predictivecoding.aspx|title=NC Lawyer by NC Bar Association - NC Bar Association's NC Lawyer|author=|date=|work=ncbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.&lt;ref&gt;Darryl Mountain, XML E-Contracts: Documents that Describe Themselves, 11(3) INT'L J.L. &amp; TECH. 274 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunziker |first1=R |date=Feb 2017 |title=New Invention Disclosure Standard – Why Would I Care? |url=http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New_Invention_Disclosure_Standard.pdf |journal=IPO Law Journal |publisher=[[Intellectual Property Owners Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==

{{main|Applications of artificial intelligence to legal informatics}}

Artificial intelligence is already employed in  [[online dispute resolution]] platforms that use optimization algorithms and blind-bidding, and may be employed extensively in the future.&lt;ref&gt;David Allen Larson, "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?" Technology Can Reduce Dispute Resolution Costs When Times Are Tough and Improve Outcomes, 11 Nev. L.J. 523, 550 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence is also frequently employed in modeling the legal [[ontology]], "an explicit, formal, and general specification of a conceptualization of properties of and relations between objects in a given domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyner | first1 = A. | year = | title = An Ontology in OWL for Legal Case-Based Reasoning | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence and Law | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 361–387 | doi=10.1007/s10506-008-9070-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative legal prediction==
Both academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4099370 Theodore W. Ruger, Pauline T. Kim, Andrew D. Martin, &amp; Kevin M. Quinn, "The Supreme Court Forecasting Project: Legal and Political Science Approaches to Predicting Supreme Court Decisionmaking" ''Columbia Law Review'' Volume 104 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01260.x | volume=9 | title=Predicting Securities Fraud Settlements and Amounts: A Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Federal Securities Class Action Lawsuits | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies | pages=482–510 | last1 = McShane | first1 = Blakeley B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also there are legal technology startups that are attempting to create proprietary models to predict case outcomes; one example is Lex Machina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lexmachina.com/|title=Legal Analytics by Lex Machina|author=|date=|work=lexmachina.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company that provides [[intellectual property]] data and analytics.

==Criminal law==
In 1995, Peter W. Martin's paper for the NCAIR Sponsored Program on the Future of Legal Information Technology, entitled "Digital Law: Some Speculations on the Future of Legal Information Technology", wondered how innovations in technology were shaping—and would shape—legal information flow, storage, and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/papers/fut95fnl.htm|title=Digital Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Martin was wondering how technology would change the fundamental nature and practice of the legal field in the United States. Martin wrote that "There is a powerful (but infrequently noticed) linkage between ways societies think about law and the technology they use in operation and distribution of it (law that is)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was writing shortly after launching the Legal Information Institute at Cornell, the first law server on the Internet. LEXIS had pioneered putting digital legal content on computers twenty-four years prior, and digital content then accounted for more than 50% of the legal information market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin asked readers to suspend their disbelief as he proposed relatively rapid shifts in the ratio of paper-based legal information to digital legal information; the power wielded by the information-seeking public vs. high-priced gatekeepers of legal information; and a shift away from the private sector as a means to basic legal data and towards more higher-level skill sets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Martin suggested "fuller" bodies of data, pointing to a case in which the court thoroughly discussed a restaurant's trademark decor without ever showing a picture of the decor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin also highlights the Penalty Statistics Database in use in sentencing in New South Wales, and comparing it to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines of the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The South Wales model, launched in 1990, allows judges access not only to both more traditional legal data, including statutory provisions and appellate decisions but also to the availability of alternate facilities (such as drug rehabilitation programs).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The "Penalty Statistics Database" furthermore gives judges access to a pre-analyzed data pool of sentencing decisions made by other sentencing officers in New South Wales, as well as full offense and offender information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this suggestion, too, Martin emphasizes the Penalty Statistics Database's use of graphical display to make the information it is transmitting to judges easier to access and utilize.

Treating legal informatics as a field as a serious tool for changing the way people interact with the law may pave the way for radical innovations in areas of law that are seen as inherently static, top-down, and bureaucratic.

==In corporate legal departments==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}Today's corporate legal departments are entities which can be as large as the biggest law firms. As such, the usage of different legal informatics technologies is important for their success. Legal departments use among other: various technology aids to manage their document databases, and more advanced assets such as patent portfolios. Some legal departments are also experimenting with the automation of certain types of tasks performed by in-house attorneys in their day-to-day practice. These tasks include: preparation of documents, editing and customization of these documents and the management of signatures.

==Corporate governance==
The prevailing [[corporate governance]] [[paradigm]], especially when [[public company|public companies]] are concerned, is largely based on the notion of the relative [[efficiency]] of separating ownership and control in managing business [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"&gt;''See'' Stephen M. Bainbridge, ''The Case for Limited Shareholder Voting Rights'', 53 UCLA L. Rev 601 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[technological change]] can affect the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] of optimal governance structure for individual [[firm]]s. For instance, by lowering the cost of both disseminating [[information]] to [[shareholder]]s and gathering [[data]] about their [[preference]]s, developments in [[communication technology]] can potentially make it preferable for some firms to organize the [[management]] of the firm in a manner more similar to, for example, [[direct democracy]], with features such as [[two-way communication]] between the company's [[senior management]] and its [[investor]]s. The study of such questions thus applies legal informatics to analyzing the relationship between [[technology]] and [[corporate governance]] structures.

[[File:Books on legal writing.jpg|thumb|right|Books on legal writing at a [[law library]]]]
'''Legal writing''' involves the analysis of [[Fact pattern|fact patterns]] and presentation of arguments in documents such as legal memoranda and [[Brief (law)|briefs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/opia/what-is-public-interest-law/public-interest-work-types/legal-writing/|title=Legal Research and Writing {{!}} Harvard Law School|last=School|first=Harvard Law|work=Harvard Law School|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One form of legal writing involves drafting a balanced analysis of a legal problem or issue. Another form of legal writing is persuasive, and advocates in favor of a legal position. Another form legal writing involves drafting [[legal instrument]]s, such as [[contract]]s and [[Will and testament|wills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_writing|title=Legal writing|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing features==

=== Authority ===
Legal writing places heavy reliance on authority. In most legal writing, the writer must back up assertions and statements with [[Legal citation|citations]] to authority.  This is accomplished by a unique and complicated citation system, unlike that used in any other genre of writing.  The standard methods for American legal citation are defined by two competing rule books: the ''[[ALWD Citation Manual]]: A Professional System of Citation'' and ''The [[Bluebook]]: A Uniform System of Citation''. Different methods may be used within the United States and in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Citation Guides/Authorities (U.S. Based)|url=https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070190|website=Harvard Law School Library|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226152027/https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070190|archive-date=2018-02-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation Guides from Foreign Jurisdictions|url=https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070191|website=Harvard Law School Library|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226151940/https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070191|archive-date=2018-02-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precedent ===
Legal writing values precedent, as distinct from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a [[contract]] and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful [[Motion (legal)|motion]] to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents ''templates'' or, less commonly, ''forms.''

=== Vocabulary ===
Legal writing extensively uses [[technical terminology]] that can be categorised in four ways:

# Specialized words and phrases unique to law, e.g., ''[[tort]]'', ''[[fee simple]]'', and ''[[novation]]''.
# Ordinary words having different meanings in law, e.g., ''action'' (lawsuit), ''[[consideration]]'' (support for a promise), ''execute'' (to sign to effect), and ''[[Party (law)|party]]'' (a principal in a lawsuit).
# Archaic vocabulary: legal writing employs many old words and phrases that were formerly quotidian language, but today exist mostly or only in law, dating from the 16th century; English examples are ''herein'', ''hereto'', ''hereby'', ''heretofore'', ''herewith'', ''whereby'', and ''wherefore'' ([[pronominal adverbs]]); ''said'' and ''such'' (as adjectives).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
# Loan words and phrases from other languages: In English, this includes terms derived from [[French language|French]] (''[[estoppel]]'', ''[[Laches (equity)|laches]]'', and ''[[voir dire]]'') and [[Latin]] (''[[certiorari]]'', ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[prima facie]]'', ''[[inter alia]]'', ''[[mens rea]]'', ''[[sub judice]]'') and are not italicised as English legal language, as would be foreign words in mainstream English writing.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Formality ===
These features tend to make legal writing formal. This formality can take the form of long sentences, complex constructions, archaic and hyper-formal vocabulary, and a focus on content to the exclusion of reader needs. Some of this formality in legal writing is necessary and desirable, given the importance of some legal documents and the seriousness of the circumstances in which some legal documents are used. Yet not all formality in legal writing is justified. To the extent that formality produces opacity and imprecision, it is undesirable. To the extent that formality hinders reader comprehension, it is less desirable. In particular, when legal content must be conveyed to nonlawyers, formality should give way to clear communication.

What is crucial in setting the level of formality in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating the status of a legal matter, is appropriately informal.

Transaction documents—legal drafting—fall on a similar continuum. A 150-page merger agreement between two large corporations, in which both sides are represented by counsel, will be highly formal—and should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A commercial lease for a small company using a small office space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a proxy statement allowing the members of a neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be. If informality aids that goal, it is justified.

Many U.S. law schools teach legal writing in a way that acknowledges the technical complexity inherent in law and the justified formality that complexity often requires, but with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and directness. Yet many practicing lawyers, busy as they are with deadlines and heavy workloads, often resort to a template-based, outdated, hyperformal writing style in both analytical and transactional documents. This is understandable, but it sometimes unfortunately perpetuates an unnecessarily formal legal writing style.

Recently a variety of tools have been produced to allow writers to automate core parts of legal writing. For example, automated tools may be used by transactional lawyers to check certain formalities while writing, and tools exist to help litigators verify citations and quotations to legal authority for motions and briefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citations and References: Let the computer do it|url=https://libguides.southernct.edu/c.php?g=179069&amp;p=1176746|website=Hilton C. Buley Library|publisher=Southern Connecticut State University|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of legal writing==

Legal writing is of two, broad categories: (i) legal analysis and (ii) legal drafting. Legal analysis is two-fold: (1) predictive analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the [[United States]], in most [[law school]]s students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) of a given action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and [[Brief (law)|briefs]]. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.

===Predictive legal analysis===

The legal memorandum is the most common type of predictive legal analysis; it may include the client letter or legal opinion. The legal memorandum predicts the outcome of a legal question by analyzing the authorities governing the question and the relevant facts that gave rise to the legal question. It explains and applies the authorities in predicting an outcome, and ends with advice and recommendations. The legal memorandum also serves as record of the research done for a given legal question. Traditionally, and to meet the legal reader's expectations, it is formally organized and written.

===Persuasive legal analysis===

The persuasive document, a motion or a brief, attempts to persuade a deciding authority to favorably decide the dispute for the author's client. Motions and briefs are usually submitted to judges, but also to mediators, arbitrators, and others. In addition a persuasive letter may attempt to persuade the dispute's opposing party.

[[Persuasive writing]] is the most rhetorically stylized. So although a brief states the legal issues, describes authorities, and applies authorities to the question—as does a memorandum—the brief's application portion is framed as an argument. The author argues for one approach to resolving the legal matter and does not present a neutral analysis.

===Legal drafting===
Legal drafting creates binding legal text. It includes enacted law like statutes, rule and regulations; contracts (private and public); personal legal documents like wills and trusts; and public legal documents like notices and instructions. Legal drafting requires no legal authority citation and generally is written without a stylised voice.

==Plagiarism==
In writing an objective analysis or a persuasive document, including a memorandum or brief, lawyers write under the same [[plagiarism]] rules applicable to most other writers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Lawyers: Don't Plagiarize Content For Your Websites|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/law-practice-management/lawyers-dont-plagiarize-content-your-websites|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional ethical implications for presenting copied materials as original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strickland|first1=Cooper J.|title=The Dark Side of Unattributed Copying and the Ethical Implications of Plagiarism in the Legal Profession|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=1 March 2012|volume=90|issue=3|page=920|url=https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&amp;article=1464&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal memoranda and briefs must properly attribute quotations and source authorities; yet, within a law office, a lawyer might borrow from other lawyers' texts without attribution, in using a well-phrased, successful argument made in a previous brief.

Plagiarism is strictly prohibited in academic work, especially in [[law review]] articles, seminar papers, and similar writings intended to reflect the author's original thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunnewold|first1=Mary|title=Plagiarism: Proceed with Caution|url=https://abaforlawstudents.com/2011/09/01/plagiarism-proceed-caution/|website=ABA For Law Students|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafting of legal documents such as contracts is different as, unlike in most other legal writing categories, it is common to use language and clauses that are derived from [[form book]]s, legal opinions and other documents without attribution. Lawyers use forms documents when drafting documents such as contracts, wills, and judgments. The key difference between using phrases or paragraphs from other legal documents, and copying in other contexts or copying the entire document, arises from the fact that lawyers are effectively drawing upon a common pool of clauses that they adjust and modify for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Kenneth A.|title=Copyright and the Contract Drafter|journal=New York Law Journal|date=23 August 2006|url=http://www.adamsdrafting.com/downloads/Copyright-NYLJ-8.23.06.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plain language movement ==
The [[Plain Language Movement]] in legal writing involves an effort to avoid complex language and terminology in legal documents, to make legal writing more understandable and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryan Garner on Plain English|url=https://www.plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/bryan-garner-on-plain-english/|website=plainlanguage.gov|publisher=Plain Language Action and Information Network|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the movement is to reduce reliance on [[Jargon|terms of art]], words that have a specific meaning within the context of the law, but that may carry a different meaning in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butt|first1=Peter|title=What is plain language law and why use it?|url=http://www.lawfoundation.net.au/ljf/app/&amp;id=/2FD34F71BE2A0155CA25714C001739DA|website=Law and Justice Foundation|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=12 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalese===
{{Original research section|date=August 2013}}
''[[Legal English|Legalese]]'' is an English term first used in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=legalese|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/legalese|website=Online Etymological Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for legal writing that is very difficult for laymen to read and understand, the implication being that this [[wikt:abstruse|abstruseness]] is deliberate for excluding the legally untrained and to justify high fees. ''Legalese'', as a term, has been adopted in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legalese|url=http://www.babylon-software.com/definition/legalese/French|website=Babylon (French)|publisher=Babylon Software Ltd.|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=estimación para el posterior deslinde en trámite de ejecución de sentencia|url=https://www.proz.com/kudoz/spanish_to_english/law_contracts/1551838-estimaci%C3%B3n_para_el_posterior_deslinde_en_tr%C3%A1mite_de_ejecuci%C3%B3n_de_sentencia.html|website=ProZ.com|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalese is characterized by long sentences, many modifying clauses, complex vocabulary, high abstraction, and insensitivity to the layman's need to understand the document's gist. Legalese arises most commonly in legal drafting, yet appears in both types of legal analysis.

Some important points in the debate of "legalese" v. "plain language" as the continued standard for legal writing include:
* Public comprehensibility: Perhaps most obviously, legalese suffers from being less comprehensible to the general public than plain English, which can be particularly important in both private (e.g., contracts) and public matters (e.g., laws, especially in democracies where the populace is seen as both responsible for and subject to the laws).&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lundin | first=Leigh | url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866 | title=Buzzwords—Bang * Splat! | work=Criminal Brief | date=2009-12-31 | accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resistance to ambiguity: Legalese may be particularly resistant to misinterpretation, be it incidental or deliberate, for two reasons:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
#Its long history of use provides a similarly extensive background of precedent tied to the language.  This precedent, as discussed above, will be a strong determinant of how documents written in legalese will be interpreted.
#The legalese language itself may be more precise when compared to plain English, having arisen from a need for such precision, among other things.

Joseph Kimble, a modern plain-English expert and advocate, rejects the claim that legalese is less ambiguous in ''The Great Myth that Plain Language is not Precise''.&lt;ref&gt;7 Scribes J. Leg. Writing 109 (1998–2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Kimble says legalese often contains so many convoluted constructions and circumlocutions that it is more ambiguous than plain English.
* Coverage of contingencies: Legal writing faces a trade off in attempting to cover all possible contingencies while remaining reasonably brief.  Legalese is characterized by a shift in priority towards the former of these concerns.  For example, legalese commonly uses [[Legal doublet|doublets and triplets of words]] (e.g., "null and void" and "dispute, controversy, or claim") which may appear redundant or unnecessary to laymen, but to a lawyer might reflect an important reference to distinct legal concepts.

Plain-English advocates suggest that no document can possibly cover every contingency, and that lawyers should not attempt to encompass every contingency they can foresee. Rather, lawyers should only draft for the known, possible, reasonably expected contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darmstadter |first=Howard |title=Hereof, Thereof, and Everywhereof: A Contrarian Guide to Legal Drafting |edition=2 |year=2008 |publisher=American Bar Association |location=Chicago, Illinois 60610 |isbn=978-1-59031-9772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, LexisNexis pioneered the electronic accessibility of legal and journalistic documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203721704577157211501855648?KEYWORDS=lexisnexis | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | first=Stephen | last=Miller | title=For Future Reference, a Pioneer in Online Reading | date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the company has the world's largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information.&lt;ref name=twosix/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:LexisNexis.JPG|thumb|LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]
Currently a division of [[RELX Group]] (formerly Reed Elsevier),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/business/the-media-business-reed-elsevier-building-big-presence-in-the-us.html?src=pm | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Edward A. | last=Gargan | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Reed-Elsevier Building Big Presence in the U.S. | date=October 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; LexisNexis was first a product of the Mead Data Central company.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twosix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2006/12/01/Lexis-Nexis-founder-Don-Wilson-dies/UPI-36121164992489/ |title=Lexis-Nexis founder Don Wilson dies |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] has owned LexisNexis and its predecessor company since 1994. At its inception in 1970, the database was named LEXIS by Mead Data Central (MDC), a subsidiary of the [[Mead Paper|Mead Corporation]]. It was a continuation of an experiment organized by the Ohio State Bar in 1967.

On April 2, 1973, LEXIS launched publicly, offering full-text search in all Ohio and New York cases. In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic archive of all U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, gave journalists a searchable database of news articles.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the capital letters in the name; it was then standard to capitalize the names of online services.&lt;/ref&gt;  LexisNexis' world headquarters is located in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="Corporate"/&gt; In 1989, MDC acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Macmillan Agrees to Sell Michie to Mead | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Macmillan-Agrees-to-Sell-Michie-to-Mead/id-c5740ca1895b2bc50f15e9f481161d1d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] launched the [[Lexus]] line of luxury vehicles in 1987, Mead Data Central sued for [[trademark infringement]] on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (such as lawyers) would confuse "Lexus" with "Lexis". A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word "Lexis". Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota's luxury car division.&lt;ref&gt;A far greater number, although by no means a majority, thought of a television character; most thought of nothing at all.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-04/business/fi-194_1_lexus-cars |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Distinctiveness of 'Lexis' Trademark Cited Toyota Can't Call Car 'Lexus,' Judge Says |date=January 4, 1989 |author=James Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mead Data Cent. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.'' 702 [[F.Supp.]] 1031 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit]] held that there was little chance of consumer confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10399856046401781554 Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales]'' 875 [[F.2d]] 1026 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called "Win a Lexus on Lexis!"

In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion.  The U.S. state of [[Illinois]] subsequently audited Mead's income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court.  On April 15, 2008, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court's precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dep't. of Revenue]]'', 553 U.S. 16 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a "unitary" business.

In 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/03/business/company-news-nexis-agrees-to-purchase-of-riskwise-international.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; NEXIS AGREES TO PURCHASE OF RISKWISE INTERNATIONAL | date=June 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Barringer| first = Felicity| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Mirror Sells Legal Unit To British-Dutch Publisher| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 1998-04-28| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/the-media-business-times-mirror-sells-legal-unit-to-british-dutch-publisher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it acquired a Canadian research database company, [[Quicklaw]]. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Anderson Publishing - LexisNexis Company Information| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = https://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/anderson.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder [[Michael Brauser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/us/politics/14giuliani.html | work=The New York Times | title=Giuliani Firm Stood to Benefit From U.S. Deals, Florida Company’s Files Show | date=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Boca Raton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/business/company-news-reed-elsevier-to-acquire-seisint-for-775-million.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; REED ELSEVIER TO ACQUIRE SEISINT FOR $775 MILLION | date=July 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seisint housed and operated the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX).

On March 9, 2005, LexisNexis announced the possible theft of personal information of some Seisint users. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/09/news/midcaps/lexisnexis/index.htm | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis customer IDs stolen | date=2005-03-09 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that number greatly increased to over 310,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/12/technology/personaltech/lexis/?cnn=yes | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis acknowledges more ID theft | date=2005-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-07 | first1=Caleb | last1=Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased [[data aggregator]] [[ChoicePoint]] (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion.  The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/ |title=LexisNexis Risk Solutions |publisher=LexisNexis.com |accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of high quality data about US healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141113/NEWS/311139944|author=Adam Rubenfire|title=LexisNexis to acquire Health Market Science|work=Modern Healthcare|date=13 November 2014| accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860) .&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk |title=LexisNexis UK – Butterworths – Tolley Innovative Business, Legal Solutions |website=Lexisnexis.co.uk |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil at [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]], [[Coventry]]. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle [[Joseph Butterworth]], the great law bookseller of [[Fleet Street]]. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen's Law Bookseller.

Butterworths was acquired by [[International Publishing Corporation]] in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = FOB: Firms Out of Business| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/fob_search_results.cfm?FOBFirmName=Butterworths&amp;FOBNote=&amp;fob-submit.x=0&amp;fob-submit.y=0&amp;fob-submit=Submit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form [[Butterworth-Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4831-0372-3| pages = –| last = Medlik| first = S.| title = Managing Tourism| chapter = Publisher's note| date = 2016-06-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6TDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=butterworths%20scientific%20reed%20international&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the [[Reed Elsevier]] Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the "LexisNexis", "Butterworths" and "Tolley" trade marks. Such publications include ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'' and the ''[[All England Law Reports]]'', amongst others.

The Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

LexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems ("CRMs"), practice management systems, electronic disclosure systems, background checking and identity verification products.&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"/&gt;

! '''Method''' !! Description
|-
| align="center" | [[Hanging]]||One of the most common methods of execution, still in use in many countries, usually with a calculated drop to cause neck fracture and instant loss of consciousness. Notably used by [[Capital punishment in India|India]], [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]], and [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Execution_by_shooting|Shooting]]|| Also a very common method. Can be applied:

* By a [[execution by shooting|single shot]] (such as the neck shot, as in [[Capital punishment in China|China]], and by various means in [[Capital_punishment_in_Russia#Procedure|Russia]] before Russia abolished capital punishment);
* By [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] (as in [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|Indonesia]]). 
* By excessively powerful weaponry such as anti-aircraft guns, according to various media sources (CNN, Fox News, The Independent, etc.), practiced in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/22/north-korea-dictator-kim-jong-uns-executions-anti-aircraft-guns-flamethrowers-mortars.html|title=North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un's executions: anti-aircraft guns, flamethrowers, mortars|author=|date=22 September 2017|website=foxnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-defector-anti-aircraft-guns-execution-kim-jong-un-killed-sex-slaves-pyongyang-porn-film-a7959851.html|title=North Korean defector reveals horror of Kim Jong-un's teenage sex slaves|author=|date=21 September 2017|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/asia/north-korea-officials-executed/index.html|title=N.

|-
| align="center" | [[Lethal injection]]|| First used in the [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] in 1982, lethal injection has been used by five other countries since then, which are China, Taiwan, Thailand, Guatemala, and Vietnam.
|-
| align="center" | [[Electric chair|Electrocution]]|| Only the United States and the [[Capital punishment in the Philippines|Philippines]] have ever used this method. Now legal in some U.S. states only to replace injection at the request of the prisoner or if injection is impractical.
|-
| align="center" | [[Gas chamber|Gas inhalation]]||Only the United States and [[Capital punishment in Lithuania|Lithuania]] have ever used this as a capital punishment method. Now legal in some U.S. states only to replace injection at the request of the prisoner or if injection is impractical. Also used in Nazi Germany during World War 2 as a weapon for [[The Holocaust|mass murder]]. It has been recently proposed to use [[nitrogen hypoxia]] to replace injection.
|-
| align="center" | [[Beheading]]|| Has been used at various points in history in many countries. One of the most famous forms is execution by [[guillotine]]. Now used only in [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] with a sword.
|-

|-
| align="center" | [[Execution by burning|Burning]]||Most infamous as a method of execution for [[Heresy|heretics]] and [[Witchcraft|witches]].

|-

|-
| align="center" | [[Falling (execution)|Falling]]||The victim is thrown off a height or into a hollow (example: the ''Barathron'' in Athens, into which the Athenian generals condemned for their part in the [[battle of Arginusae]] were cast).&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''"Hellenica"'', book I, chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina during the [[Dirty War]], those [[forced disappearance|secretly abducted]] were later drugged and [[Death flights|thrown from an airplane into the ocean]].

|-
| align="center" | [[Immurement]]||The confinement of a person by walling off any exits; since they were usually kept alive through an opening, this was more a form of [[imprisonment for life]] than of capital punishment (example: the countess [[Elisabeth Báthory]], who lived for four more years after having been immured).

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427004533/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address|date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023946/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.vermont.gov/licenses/change-name-address|title=Change Address or Name on Your License – Department of Motor Vehicles|website=dmv.vermont.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; require it be registered within 30&amp;nbsp;days, while [[North Carolina]] allows up to 60&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.org/dmv/driver_services/drivershandbook/chapter1/renewalLicense.html#RDNameChanges|title=NCDOT: License and ID|work=[[North Carolina Department of Transportation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|title=New York State DMV|work=New York State DMV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626065446/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|archivedate=2012-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

The '''''New Criminal Law Review''''' ({{ISSN|1933-4192}}) is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[law journal]] published by [[University of California Press]]. It was established in 1997 as the ''Buffalo Criminal Law Review'', but changed names in 2007 after the [[University of California Press]] took responsibility for publishing the journal. The ''New Criminal Law Review'' focuses on examinations of crime, [[philosophy of criminal law]], and [[punishment (criminal)|punishment]] in domestic, transnational, and international contexts.

The ''New Criminal Law Review'' is ranked as the number one criminal law review, and is ranked as the tenth journal in the world.&lt;ref&gt;see Washington &amp; Lee Law School, Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking, law.wlu.edu)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verification needed|date=February 2013}}

{{Rights}}
A '''patient's bill of rights''' is a list of guarantees for those receiving medical care. It may take the form of a law or a non-binding declaration. Typically a patient's [[bill of rights]] guarantees patients information, fair treatment, and [[autonomy]] over medical decisions, among other rights.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, the [[Patient's Charter]] was introduced and revised in the 1990s. It was replaced by the [[NHS Constitution for England]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]] there have been a number of attempts to enshrine a patient's bill of rights in law, including a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] rejected by Congress in 2001.

===Bill of 2001===
[[File:Patients Bill of Rights Ron Klink.jpg|thumb|A rally for the patients' bill of rights proposed in 2001, with [[Bill Clinton]], [[Joe Hoeffel]], [[Ron Klink]], [[Ed Rendell]], and [[Chaka Fattah]].]]
The [[United States Congress]] considered a bill designed to safeguard patients' rights in 2001. The "Bipartisan Patient Protection Act" ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/1052 S.1052]), sponsored by Senators [[Edward Kennedy]] and [[John McCain]],  contained new rules for what [[health maintenance organization]]s had to cover and granted new rights for patients to sue in state or federal courts, if they are denied needed care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bipartisan Patients' Bill Of Rights Act| last=Dubno| first=Dan| publisher=CBS| date=June 18, 2001| accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed differing versions of the proposed law. Although both bills would have provided patients key rights, such as prompt access to [[emergency care]] and [[medical specialist]]s, only the Senate-passed measure would provide patients with adequate means to enforce their rights.  The Senate's proposal would have conferred a broad array of rights on patients. It would have ensured that patients with health care plans had the right to:
*have their medical decisions made by a doctor;
*see a medical specialist;
*go to the closest emergency room;

The bill was passed by the US Senate by a vote of 59–36 in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senate Vote #220 in 2001. S. 1052 (107th): Bipartisan Patient Protection Act |website=GovTrack |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2001/s220 |access-date=3 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was then amended by the House of Representatives and returned to the Senate. However, it ultimately failed.

===Industry resistance===

[[Wendell Potter]], former senior executive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Health/story?id=7911195&amp;page=1 |title=How Insurance Companies Hurt Policyholders - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Cigna]] turned whistleblower, has written that the insurance industry has worked to kill "any reform that might interfere with insurers' ability to increase profits" by engaging in extensive and well-funded, anti-reform campaigns. The industry, however, "goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view," including the use of "front groups." Indeed, in a successful 1998 effort to kill the Patient Bill of Rights then,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the insurers formed a front group
called the Health Benefits Coalition to kill efforts to pass a
Patients Bill of Rights. While it was billed as a broad-based business
coalition that was led by the [[National Federation of Independent Business]] and included the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the Health
Benefits Coalition in reality got the lion’s share of its funding and
guidance from the big insurance companies and their trade
associations. Like most front groups, the Health Benefits Coalition was set up and run out of one of Washington’s biggest P.R. firms. The P.R. firm
provided all the staff work for the Coalition. The tactics worked. Industry allies in Congress made sure the Patients’ Bill of Rights would not become law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potter |first=Wendell |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/09/15/potter_pr/index.html |title=How corporate P.R. works to kill healthcare reform |publisher=Salon.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===AAPS proposal===
{{Unreferenced section |date=September 2016}}
Some have cited differences between [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]] and [[political freedom|personal freedoms]]. Asserting that medical care "must be rendered under conditions that are acceptable to both patient and physician," the [[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]] adopted a list of patient freedoms in 1990, which was modified and adopted as a 'patients' bill of rights' in 1995:

"All patients should be guaranteed the following freedoms:

*To seek consultation with the physician(s) of their choice;
*To contract with their physician(s) on mutually agreeable terms;
*To be treated confidentially, with access to their records limited to those involved in their care or designated by the patient;
*''To use their own resources to purchase the care of their choice;''
*''To refuse medical treatment even if it is recommended by their physician(s);''
*''To be informed about their medical condition, the risks and benefits of treatment and appropriate alternatives;''
*''To refuse third-party interference in their medical care, and to be confident that their actions in seeking or declining medical care will not result in third-party-imposed penalties for patients or physicians;''
*''To receive full disclosure of their insurance plan in plain language, including:''
#''CONTRACTS: A copy of the contract between the physician and health care plan, and between the patient or employer and the plan;''
#''INCENTIVES: Whether participating physicians are offered financial incentives to reduce treatment or ration care;''
#''COST: The full cost of the plan, including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles;''
#''COVERAGE: Benefits covered and excluded, including availability and location of 24-hour emergency care;''
#''QUALIFICATIONS: A roster and qualifications of participating physicians;''
#''APPROVAL PROCEDURES: Authorization procedures for services, whether doctors need approval of a committee or any other individual, and who decides what is medically necessary;''
#''REFERRALS: Procedures for consulting a specialist, and who must authorize the referral;''
#''APPEALS: Grievance procedures for claim or treatment denials;''
#''GAG RULE: Whether physicians are subject to a gag rule, preventing criticism of the plan.''

The '''philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of canon law''' are the fields of [[legal philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology (Catholic Church)|theological]] ([[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]]), and [[legal theory|legal scholarship]] which concern the place of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the nature of the [[Catholic Church]], both as a natural and as a supernatural entity. [[Philosophy]] and theology shape the concepts and self-understanding of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] as the law of both a human organization and as a supernatural entity, since the [[Catholic Church]] believes that [[Jesus Christ]] instituted the church by direct divine command, while the fundamental theory of canon law is a meta-discipline of the "triple relationship between theology, philosophy, and canon law".&lt;ref name=Orsy11&gt;Ladislas Orsy, "Towards a Theological Conception of Canon Law" (published in Jordan Hite, T.O.R., &amp; Daniel J. Ward, O.S.B., "Readings, Cases, Materials in Canon Law: A Textbook for Ministerial Students, Revised Edition" (Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1990), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of canon law==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
A triple species of human [positive] law is distinguished: ecclesiastical or canon law, [[law|civil law]], and the [[jus gentium|law of nations]]. Canon law {jus canonicum} and civil law differ among themselves partly by nature of origin, partly by nature of object, and partly by nature of end:
*They differ in origin: for the origin of the civil power is from God the author of nature; while the origin of the ecclesiastical power is from God the contributor of supernatural grace.
*They differ in object: because canon law regulates spiritual and sacred matters, while civil law regulates matters temporal and political. 
*They differ in end: for canon law especially aims at the eternal happiness {beatitudo} of people; civil law, however, aims at their temporal happiness {felicitas}.&lt;ref&gt;Bargilliat, M., “Prælectiones Juris Canonici—Tomus Primus” (Parisiis: Berche et Tralin, Editores, 1909), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotelian-Thomistic jurisprudence===
{{Main article|Politics (Aristotle)|Treatise on Law|Determinatio}}
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|right|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
Although canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]-[[Treatise on Law|Thomistic]] [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;CanonLaw.info, [http://www.canonlaw.info/ main page]. Accessed 9 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly discusses the place of canon law in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''&lt;ref&gt;J. Budziszewski, [http://www.undergroundthomist.org/the-architecture-of-law-according-to-thomas-aquinas The Architecture of Law According to Thomas Aquinas]; accessed 14 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; (a small section of his ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]''). However, Aquinas himself was influenced by canon law; the fourth clause of his famous 4-part definition of law—the requirement of [[promulgation]]—is taken from the canonists, and the ''sed contra'' of his article on promulgation cites [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] (the "Father of Canon Law") as an authority.&lt;ref&gt;Blackfriars ''Summa Theologiæ'' Vol. 28, pg. 16 [notes by Thomas Gilby O.P. on ''Summa'' Ia-IIæ, q. 90, a. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; According to René A. Wormser,
{{quote|[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s service in assembling and co-ordinating [sic.] the mass of canon law was of inestimable value; but the man to whom the Church and canon law are most indebted is [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]...And it is largely upon the thesis of St. Thomas Aquinas that the Church jurists went so far as to pronounce that laws were of absolutely no force whatever if they were not for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;René A. Wormser, The Story of the LAW, pp. 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the term "law" (''lex'') is never explicitly defined in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgray.org/comps/book1.html JGray.org], accessed June-8-2013&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] cites [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] in defining law as "...an ordinance of reason for the common good, [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by the one who is in charge of the community"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6X.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §1976], citing ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' I-II, 90, 4&lt;/ref&gt; and reformulates it as "...a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6T.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] §1951&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, dispute the applicability of the [[Treatise on Law|Thomistic definition of law]] (''lex'') to canon law, arguing that its application would impoverish [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiology]] and corrupt the very supernatural end of canon law.&lt;ref&gt;Exegetical Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, Vol. I, pg. 261-262 (commentary on 1983 CIC, Book I, Title I)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jus Publicum Ecclesiasticum''===
With the birth of the omni-competent sovereign nation-state in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson &amp; McHenry, ''The American Federal Government'', pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed exclusive jurisdiction over all its citizens, the dual or [[concurrent jurisdiction]] of the Catholic Church and the sovereign state was intellectually and legally challenged. In the new legal and politico-religious climate in the period following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the newly formed [[sovereign state]]s of Europe claimed more jurisdiction over areas of law and legal practice which had traditionally been under the jurisdiction of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; In this post-Reformation period of political change, [[canon lawyer|canonical jurists]] sought to defend within the categories of the [[public law]] the right of the [[Catholic Church]] to make and enforce [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the name, ''jus publicum ecclesiasticum''—"public ecclesiastical law". 

{{quote|The Church is not merely a corporation (''collegium'') or part .of civil society. Hence, the maxim is false, "''Ecclesia est in statu''," or, the Church is placed under the power of the state. The Church is rightly named a Sovereign State. This is proved by Soglia 13 in these words : "''Ex defmitione Pufiendorfii, Status est conjunctio plurium hominum, quae imperio per homines administrate, sibi proprio, et aliunde non dependente, continetur. Atqui ex institutione Christi, Ecclesia est conjunctio hominum, quae per homines, hoc est, per Petrum et Apostolos, eorumque successores administratur cum imperio sibi proprio, nee aliunde dependente ; ergo Ecclesia est Status''."&lt;ref&gt;REV. S. B. SMITH, D.D., [https://archive.org/stream/elementsofeccles01smituoft/elementsofeccles01smituoft_djvu.txt ELEMENTS ECCLESIASTICAL LAW, 9th Edition] (1895), §185&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The justification of the legal powers of the Catholic Church would now be defended along the lines of the [[sovereign state]]'s justification for its own legal powers, and the Catholic Church would be considered a concurrent and complementary ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'' in the realm of the supernatural end of man to that of the civil [[sovereign state]] in the realm of the natural end of man.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Communitas Perfecta''===
{{main article|Communitas Perfecta}}
Many canonists, in the years preceding the [[Second Vatican Council]], considered the justification and basis for canon law being a true legal system to be that the [[Catholic Church]] was established by [[Jesus Christ]] as a ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'', and as such was a true human society which had the right to make human law.

{{quote|“…the Church is a Sovereign State, that is, a perfect and supreme society, established by our Lord for the purpose of leading men to heaven. We say, a society; now what is a society? Speaking in general, it is a number of persons associated together, in order to attain, by united efforts, some common end. We say, perfect; because she is complete of herself, and therefore has within her own bosom all the means sufficient to enable her to attain her end. We say, supreme, because she is subject to no other society on earth. Like every society, the Church is an external organization. For she is composed of human beings, who have a body as well as a soul. She is, in fact, by the will of her divine Founder, a community, an association of men, governed by men. Like every external organization, the Church must be governed by laws and regulations that will enable her to fulfill her mission and attain her end. The aim and end of the Church is the worship of God and the salvation of souls. Any action or omission, therefore, on the part of her members, which hinders her from carrying out her mission or reaching her end, and, consequently, whatever contravenes the regulations made by her concerning the worship of God and the sanctification of her children, is punishable by her. For God, having given her a mission, also gave her the means or the power to fulfill it. Hence she can establish, in fact has established, laws, and regulations, obligatory on her members. If the members violate those laws, they not only sin against God, but they offend also against the order, discipline, laws, or regulations established by the Church.”&lt;ref&gt;REV. S. B. SMITH, D.D., [https://archive.org/stream/elementsecclesia03smituoft/elementsecclesia03smituoft_djvu.txt ELEMENTS OF ECCLESIASTICAL LAW, VOL. III. ECCLESIASTICAL PUNISHMENTS. SECOND, REVISED EDITION.] (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1888), §§1658-1659 (accessed 31 January 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Della Rocca asserts that it is a "fundamental principle of canon law which insists on the right of the Church as a [[Communitas Perfecta|perfect society]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In the context of ecclesiological discourse, "perfect society (''societas perfecta'')" and "perfect community (''[[Communitas Perfecta|communitas perfecta]]'')" have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine, particularly in the field of legislation, the limits of its own power."&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Pope Benedict XV]], in his [[apostolic constitution]] promulgating the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]], attributes the legislative authority of the church to it being founded by Jesus Christ with all the requirements for a ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XV, ap. const. ''Providentissima Mater Ecclesia'', (found in Peters [trans.], ''1917 Code of Canon Law'', pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology of canon law==
{{see also|Catholic theology|Ecclesiology (Catholic Church)}}
In the decades following the [[Second Vatican Council]], many canonists called for a more theological, rather than philosophical, conception of canon law,&lt;ref name=Fundamental71&gt;Errázuriz, ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the "triple relationship between theology, philosophy, and canon law".&lt;ref name=Orsy11/&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], in his address of 21 January 2012 before the [[Roman Rota]], taught that canonical laws can only be [[interpretation (canon law)|interpreted]] and fully understood within the [[Catholic Church]] in the light of her mission and [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] structure.&lt;ref name=Rota2012&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'':&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Were one to tend to identify Canon Law with the system of the laws of the canons, the understanding of that which is juridical in the Church would essentially consist in the comprehending of that which the legal texts establish. At first glance, this approach would appear to hold Human Law entirely in value. However the impoverishment which this conception would bring about becomes manifest: with the practical oblivion of the [[Natural Law]] and of the [[Divine Positive Law]], as well as the vital relationship of every Law with the communion and the mission of the Church, the work of the interpreter becomes deprived of vital contact with ecclesial reality.&lt;ref name=Rota2012/&gt;
}}
Some authors conceive of canon law as ''essentially'' theological and the discipline of canon law as a theological subdiscipline,&lt;ref name=Fundamental71/&gt; but Msgr. Carlos José Errázuriz contends that "in a certain sense, all postconciliar canonical scholarship has shown a theological concern in the widest sense, that is, a tendency to determine more clearly the place of the juridical in the mystery of the Church."&lt;ref name=Fundamental71/&gt;

===Ecclesiological inspiration of the 1983 Code===
{{Main article|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
In view of the decision to reform the existing Code, the [[Second Vatican Council]], in the [[decree (canon law)|decree]] ''[[Optatam totius]]'' (§16), ordered that "the teaching of canon law...should take into account the mystery of the Church, according to the [[apostolic constitution|dogmatic constitution]] ''[[Lumen Gentium|De Ecclesia]]''...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651028_optatam-totius_en.html ''Optatam totius''] §16, accessed 14 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 Code]] was structured according to the [[Roman law]] division of "norms, persons, things, procedures, penalties", while the 1983 Code, in total contrast, was deliberately given a much more doctrinal-theological structure. [[John Paul II]] described the ecclesiological inspiration of the new code of canon law in this way:&lt;ref name=sacrae&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_sacrae-disciplinae-leges_en.html Sacrae Disciplinae Leges], accessed Jan-11-2013&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
The instrument, which the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code]] is, fully corresponds to the [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|nature of the Church]], especially as it is proposed by the teaching of the Second Vatican Council in general, and in a particular way by its [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] teaching. Indeed, in a certain sense, this new Code could be understood as a great effort to translate this same doctrine, that is, the [[Second Vatican Council|conciliar]] ecclesiology, into canonical language. If, however, it is impossible to translate perfectly into [[jurisprudence of canon law|canonical language]] the conciliar image of the Church, nevertheless, in this image there should always be found as far as possible its essential point of reference.&lt;ref name=sacrae/&gt;

Thus the 1983 Code is configured, as far as possible, according to the "mystery of the Church", the most significant divisions—Books II, III, and IV—corresponding to the ''munus regendi'', the ''munus sanctificandi'', and the ''munus docendi'' (the "missions" of governance, of worship/sanctification, and of teaching) which in turn derive from the kingly, the priestly and the prophetic roles or functions of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Confer "CANON LAW AND COMMUNIO

==Fundamental theory of canon law==
{{see also|Ecclesiology (Catholic Church)}}
The fundamental theory of canon law is a discipline covering the basis of canon law in the very nature of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental theory is a newer discipline that takes as is object "the existence and nature of what is [[justice|juridical]] in the [[Catholic Church|Church of Jesus Christ]]."&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[discipline (academia)|discipline]] seeks to provide a theoretical basis for the coexistence and complementarity of canon law and the [[Catholic Church]], and it seeks to refute the "canonical antijuridicism" (the belief that ''law of the church'' constitutes a contradiction in terms; that ''law'' and ''church'' are radically incompatible)&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; of the various heretical movements and of the [[Protestant Reformation]]&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 7, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, and on the other, the antijuridicism deriving from a belief that all law is identifiable with the law of the state; that in order to be true law, the state must be its maker.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline seeks to better explain the nature of law in the church and engages in theological discussions in post-[[Vatican II|conciliar]] Catholicism&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 59 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to combat "postconciliar antijuridicism".&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 62&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mid-19th century [[Scandinavism]] political movement led to the modern use of the term [[Scandinavia]].]]

In the [[social science]]s, a '''political movement''' is a [[social group]] that operates together to obtain a [[political]] [[goal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[dict:political movement|Political movement]]. dict.org&lt;/ref&gt; on a local, regional, national, or international scope. Political [[Political process theory|movements develop]], [[Coordination game|coordinate]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Coordination failure (political science)|Coordination failure]]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[decree]]s, [[Speech_act#Classifying_illocutionary_speech_acts|declaration]]s, and [[wikt:announcement|announcement]]s&lt;/ref&gt; revise,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Historical revisionism|political revisionism]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amendment|amend]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Constitutional amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermeneutics|interpret]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Judicial interpretation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propaganda|produce materials]] that are intended to address the goals of the [[Identity politics|base of the movement]]. A [[social movement]] in the area of [[politics]] can be organized around a single issue or set of issues, or around a set of shared concerns of a [[social group]]. In a [[political party]], a [[political organization]] seeks to influence, or control, [[government policy]], usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. Parties often espouse an [[ideology]], expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [coalition] among [[disparate]] interests.

==Examples==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]], the [[ecology movement]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]].  Many have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as [[abolitionism]], the [[women's suffrage]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], the [[disability rights movement]], or the inclusive [[human rights]] movement.  Some have represented class interests, such as the [[Labour movement]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], others have expressed national aspirations, such as [[Anticolonialism|anticolonialist]] movements, [[Ratana]], [[Zionism]], and [[Sinn Féin]].  Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].

With [[globalization]], [[global citizens movement]]s may have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Global Citizens Movement. A New Actor For a New Politics | publisher=TransNational Institute | date=2001-10-18 | accessdate=2013-06-05 | author=George, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements may be named by outsiders, as with the [[levellers]] political movement in 17th century England was so named as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Plant, David | url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm | title = The Levellers | accessdate = 2013-06-05| date = 2005-12-14 | work = British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

== UK domestic politicians ==
{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Colonial ==
{{Princely states topics}}
These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22222">In [[financial regulation]], "'''politically exposed person'''" ('''PEP''') is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

==Implementation==
Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.&lt;ref name="Ukraine Crisis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=The $70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine: Does it Demonstrate a Whopping Failure of Global Anti-Money Laundering and Corruption Laws? Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/2014/02/the-ukrainian-crisis-means-for-banks-funds-and-bitcoin.html|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk.&lt;ref name="Politically Exposed Persons"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=Politically Exposed Persons, Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/politically-exposed-person|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{See also|Banco de Chile#Controversies{{!}}Banco de Chile}}

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |January 2015}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5)&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/regulation/14/made|work=No. 2157 PART 2 Enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, Regulation 14|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

|url=http://www.lkshields.ie/publications/the-fourth-anti-money-laundering-directive|publisher=LK Shields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}} It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having [[Toxic asset|frozen assets]] in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position.

Geneva based Polixis&lt;ref&gt;http://polixis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/geneve-bureau-polixis-robotise-controle-clients-fortunes-banques/story/19614383&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1707">A '''presumption of constitutionality''' shifts the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from the government to the citizen, requiring them to prove that a statute is [[unconstitutional]]. 

In [[Federalist 78]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote that courts should be able strike down a statute as unconstitutional only if there is an "irreconcilable variance" between the statute and the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander. [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa78.htm Federalist #78] (1788-06-14).&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, a statute should be upheld.

Likewise, at the 1787 [[Philadelphia Convention]], Virginia delegate [[George Mason]] said that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_7_2-3s4.html "Founders’ Constitution, Article 1, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3"], Records of the Federal Convention (1787-06-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Randy Barnett]] argues that such a presumption is itself unconstitutional and suggests that government should be forced to prove that laws that violate liberty are necessary and prope in what he calls the "presumption of liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy.  ''[[Restoring the Lost Constitution|Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]]'' (Princeton University Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presumption of guilt''', in Latin, ''ei incumbit probatio qui negat, non qui dicit'' (the burden of proof is on the one who denies, not on one who declares), is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent. Generally, this is an [[argument from ignorance]], a philosophical concept in which a thing is assumed to be true because not proved false.

Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then [[Burden of proof (philosophy)#Proving a negative|prove a negative]] to achieve [[acquittal]]. The phrase has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;
T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Default effect|default position]] based on pessimism and [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] whereas [[presumption of innocence]] is based more on optimism and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. There is a greater likelihood of obtaining a [[wrongful conviction]]. For example, in the [[murder of Lynette White]] case, a double wrong was committed in that innocent men were convicted, while the real perpetrator remained at large and a danger to the public.

Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of guilt, the defence must collect and present compelling evidence to the [[trier of fact]] (a judge or a jury). The defence must, in most cases prove that the accused is innocent.

==Widespread prevalence==
Presumption of guilt is pandemic, occasionally erupting into epidemic proportions. Smaller instances include adverse accusatory reactions to unusual costume such as the [[burqa]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Rainey]], 'Here's what happens when you wear a burka in Northern Ireland towns', The Belfast Telegraph, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or merely a 'suspicious stare' from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P Crank]], ''Understanding Police Culture'', Routledge, p 146&lt;/ref&gt; More severe is the [[blame culture]] inherent in bureaucratic organisations where those with the least responsibility are blamed the most.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in the '[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]' – that Jews and profiteers were collectively guilty of losing the war for Germany in 1918 – is an extreme instance of guilt being presumed.

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take many forms: 
* [[Guilt by association]], for example, punishing the families of North Korean defectors.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurence and Ju-Min Park, 'Guilty by association: growing up in hell of North Korean gulag', Reuters, may 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Extrajudicial punishment]] such as [[lynching]] or other forms of [[vigilantism]], which seek to bypass legal procedures;
* [[Blaming the victim]]; for example, victims of rape in Saudi Arabia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicky Baker]], 'Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail', The Guardian, 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neela Debnath]], 'rape victims still blamed for sexual violence in Somalia', The Independent, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though in fact only the Romans had the legal authority to crucify someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Fraser]], 'Christians must understand that for Jews the cross is a symbol of oppression', [[The Guardian]], 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]]; 
* [[Judicial misconduct]] such as [[collusion]] with the prosecution; [[judicial murder]]
* A [[frameup]], usually admissions presumably made, "false statements". All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.[[miscarriage of justice]]; 
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine; 
* [[Precrime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]]
* Preemptive action such as [[drone strikes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|title=Drone attacks go against every human rights principle in the book|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/06/drone-attacks-against-human-rights-principle-book|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]];&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[authority fallacy]], demonstrated by the [[Milgram experiment]], in which persons may be too much inclined to follow orders from a perceived [[authoritarian]] figure; as in the extreme case of [[Hitler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], and the [[Final solution]].
* Short-term political gain and the destruction of political rivals, as in the [[Stalinist]] [[show trials]] of the 1930s.
* Dissatisfaction or impatience with due [[legal process]] which [[vigilantes]] and others see as 'weak'.
* 'Impatience and fear of jurors, 'media frenzy', a punitive culture, and cognitive bias'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Findley]], 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* Psychological game-playing; the aggressive accuser is said to play [[mind games]], while the victim is on a [[guilt trip]]. Guilt feelings may be residual from early childhood, in which all of us are powerless and presumption of guilt ('you naughty boy', 'shame on you, wicked child') is often the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mind-set which favours [[Apocalypticism]]. According to [[Jonathan Schell]], the religiously orthodox may 'take it upon themselves to please a wrathful God' through the 'extinction of 'evil' mankind'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypticism attracts 'desperate, humiliated and defeated' people, says [[John Michael Greer]]; it 'offers a free ticket out of the troubles of everyday life'.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Presumption of guilt is as old as [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] itself. In ancient Greece, public officials were elected for very limited terms of office and barred from re-election, on the presumption that too long an incumbency would lead to abuse of power. [[Thucydides]] and [[Aristophanes]]&lt;ref&gt;M S Silk, ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 372&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the crowd were too easily swayed by [[Eloquence|oratory]]  and emotion. As [[Lord Acton]] wrote in the 19th century, again expressing presumption of guilt, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,..."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887] published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was a persistent presumer of guilt in those he disliked. Being allegedly a [[psychopath]] and [[narcissist]]&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia article [[psychopathography of Adolf Hitler]]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to blame others when things went wrong. From 1918 he blamed Germany's defeat on the [[November criminals]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] for negotiating a truce when Germany still had the capacity to fight on; in [[Mein Kampf]] he wrote; 'every third German is a traitor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, when it was clear that Germany could not win the war, Hitler wished to punish the entire nation for failing to meet his expectations, according to [[Sebastian Haffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 120, 157, 160, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were unfairly accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], or even killed like [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. The McCarthyites 'never produced a single Communist spy whose guilt was proved in court.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Don E Carleton]] and [[John Henry Faulk]], ''Red Scare: Right-Wing Hysteria, Fifties Fanaticism, and Their Legacy in Texas'', University of Texas Press, 2014, p x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], supreme leader of [[Iran]], pronounced a death sentence by [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]] and anyone assisting publication of his book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; 'I call on all Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay'. the Fatwa was condemned for violating [[national sovereignty]], [[freedom of speech]], and the Muslim principle of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]], 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-incrimination ==
{{main|Self-incrimination}}
In the UK case ''Hale'', 2 P. C. 290 (n), the defendant was alleged to have murdered his niece, who had cried out 'good uncle do not kill me', and then was seen no more. The defendant, asked to produce the girl in court, had fraudulently produced another girl disguised as the niece. The court presumed him guilty on this basis and he was executed. Later, the niece was found, alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=TC | last=Granger | title=A Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases | publisher=Benning and co | year=1846 | page=18 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ifFiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=Hale,+2P.C.290(n)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCEInjyO8T&amp;sig=vdmOWhomV6cRdpLo4JCG7pkCPVY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8-LyF5ZPZAhWywVkKHbOrCZ0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%2C%202P.C.290(n)&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American actor and producer [[Jeremy Piven]] has spoken out against the [[Me Too movement]], which, he claims, 'put lives in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence'. Writing about Piven's comment, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], suggests that the presumption of innocence, which barrister and writer [[John Mortimer]] described as a 'golden thread', is being weakened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)]], 'Whatever Happened to the Presumption of Innocence?', ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2017.

High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that 'only 0.1% of rape allegations are false' ('lying with statistics' or straight-out lie to prejudice, this is better than 'accusers never lie', which is obviously false.) and in which all complainants are treated as 'victims' from the start. In three cases which later collapsed, including those of Liam Allan and Danny Kay, police withheld vital evidence from the defence. &lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Giannangeli]], 'Police must stop training 'Presumption of Guilt', says High Court judge', Daily Express, 24 December 2017.

{{rights}}

The '''rights of Englishmen''' are the perceived traditional rights of citizens of England. In the 18th century, some of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists who objected to British rule]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies in North America]] argued that their traditional{{sfnp|Zuckert|2003}} rights as [[Englishmen]] were being violated. The colonists wanted and expected the rights that they (or their forebears) had previously enjoyed in England: a local, representative government, with regards to judicial matters (some colonists were being sent back to England for trials) and particularly with regards to taxation.{{sfnp|Tindall |1984}} Belief in these rights subsequently became a widely-accepted justification for the [[American Revolution]].{{sfnp|Swindler|1976}}{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

The American colonies had since the 17th century been fertile ground for liberalism within the center of European political discourse.{{sfnp|Heale|1986}} However, as the ratification of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] approached, the issue among the colonists of which particular rights were significant became divisive. [[George Mason]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], stated that "We claim nothing but the liberty and privileges of Englishmen in the same degree, as if we had continued among our brethren in Great Britain."{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

==Historical background== 
{{Further information|Fundamental Laws of England}}
[[File:Sir William Blackstone from NPG.jpg|alt=|thumb|18th-century English jurist William Blackstone attempted to explain the rights of English citizens.]]
In the tradition of [[Whig history]], Judge [[William Blackstone]] called them "The absolute rights of every Englishman", and explained how they had been established slowly over centuries of [[English history]], in his book on ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', which was the first part of his influential ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.&lt;ref name=Blackstone&gt;[[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the first part of ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', pp. 123–24. Scanned in text available at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Yale Law School Libraries online]. Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They were certain basic rights that all subjects of the [[English monarch]] were understood to be entitled to,&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt; such as those expressed in [[Magna Carta]] since 1215, the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a legal case in 1608 that came to be known as ''[[Calvin's Case]]'', or the ''Case of the Postnati'', the [[Law Lords]] decided in 1608 that [[Scotsmen]] born after [[King James I]] united [[Scotland]] and England (the ''postnati'') had all the rights of Englishmen. This decision would have a subsequent effect on the concept of the "rights of Englishmen" in British America.{{sfnp|Price|1997}}{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}}{{sfnp|Pearson|2005}}

Some scholars believed that the case did not fit British America's situation, and thus reasoned that the 18th-century colonists could "claim all the rights and protections of English citizenship."&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book | author = Ellen Holmes Pearson | chapter = Revising Custom, Embracing Choice: Early American Legal Scholars and the Republicanization of Common Law | editor = Eliga H.

==Legacy in United States law==
Owing to its inclusion in the standard legal treatises of the 19th century,{{efn|Compiled by [[Edward Coke]], [[William Blackstone]], and [[James Kent]].}} ''Calvin's Case'' was well known in the early judicial history of the United States.{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}} Consideration of the case by the [[United States Supreme Court]] and by state courts transformed it into a rule regarding American citizenship and solidified the concept of ''[[jus soli]]''&amp;nbsp;– the right by which nationality or citizenship can be recognised to any individual born in the territory of the related state&amp;nbsp;– as the primary determining factor controlling the acquisition of citizenship by birth.{{sfnp|Price|1997|pages=138–39}}

The Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]] asserted that the "rights of Englishmen" were a foundation of American law in his dissenting opinion on the [[Slaughter-House Cases]], the first Supreme Court interpretation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], in 1873.{{efn|In his dissenting decision, Bradley wrote:{{quote|The people of this country brought with them to its shores the rights of Englishmen, the rights which had been wrested from English sovereigns at various periods of the nation's history.... England has no written constitution, it is true, but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour. A violation of one of the fundamental principles of that constitution in the Colonies, namely, the principle that recognizes the property of the people as their own, and which, therefore, regards all taxes for the support of government as gifts of the people through their representatives, and regards taxation without representation as subversive of free government, was the origin of our own revolution.}}}}

{{Politics}}

The '''rule of law''' is "The authority and influence of [[law]] in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' online (accessed September 13, 2018;  spelling Americanized).  The phrase "the rule of law" is also sometimes used in other senses.  ''See'' Garner, Bryan A. (Editor in Chief). ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 9th Edition, p. 1448. (Thomson Reuters, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-314-26578-4}}.  Black's provides a five definitions of "rule of law":  the lead definition is "A substantive legal principle";  the second is the "supremacy of regular as opposed to arbitrary power".&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "the rule of law" refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.  

Use of the phrase can be traced back to 16th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]], and in the following century the Scottish theologian [[Samuel Rutherford]] employed it in arguing against the [[divine right of kings]].&lt;ref name="Rex" /&gt;  [[John Locke]] wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty.  "The rule of law" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist [[A. V. Dicey]]. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers;  for example, [[Aristotle]] wrote: "It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens".&lt;ref name="ari" /&gt;

The rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including people who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Charles.  ''The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law'', p. 57 (University Press of Kansas, 1996): according to [[John Marshall]], "the framers of the Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it stands in contrast to a [[monarchy]] or [[oligarchy]] where the rulers are held above the law. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and monarchies, for example, because of neglect or ignorance of the law, and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it.

==History==
Although credit for popularizing the expression "the rule of law" in modern times is usually given to [[A. V. Dicey]],&lt;ref name=Wormuth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bingham|Bingham, Thomas]]. ''The Rule of Law'', p. 3 (Penguin 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including [[ancient Greece]], [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Anthony. ''A World History of Ancient Political Thought'' (Oxford University Press 2009). {{ISBN|0-19-928169-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
In the [[Western civilization|West]], the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;  [[Plato]] advocated a [[benevolent dictatorship|benevolent monarchy]] ruled by an idealized [[philosopher king]], who was above the law.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;David Clarke, "[http://www.lfip.org/lawe506/documents/lawe506davidclarke.pdf The many meanings of the rule of law]" in Kanishka Jayasuriya, ed., ''Law, Capitalism and Power in Asia'' (New York: Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that "Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSKTvJDrr5kC&amp;pg=PA1402&amp;lpg=PA1402&amp;dq=%22if+law+is+the+master+of+the+government+and+the+government+is+its+slave%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XNhu-PDe7H&amp;sig=4in2cTSQVL-2gcq9i881VqWYUxo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UmTZSZDIKqntlQe4vLzgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA1402,M1 Complete Works By Plato]'', p. 1402 (Hackett Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; More than Plato attempted to do, [[Aristotle]] flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.&lt;ref name=ari&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' [[s:Politics (Ellis)/Book 3#3:16|3.16]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman statesman [[Cicero]] is often cited as saying, roughly:   "We are all servants of the laws in order to be free."&lt;ref&gt;In full: "The magistrates who administer the law, the judges who act as its spokesmen, all the rest of us who live as its servants, grant it our allegiance as a guarantee of our freedom."{{mdash}}{{cite book|author=Cicero|title=Murder Trials|translator=Michael Grant|location=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin|year=1975|series=Penguin Classics|page=217}}  
Original Latin:  "Legum ministri magistratus, legum interpretes iudices, legum denique idcirco omnes servi sumus ut liberi esse possimus."{{mdash}}{{cite web|url=

Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (''legibus solutus''), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.&lt;ref name=Wormuth&gt;Wormuth, Francis. ''The Origins of Modern Constitutionalism'', p. 28 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, members of the school of [[w:Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted "rule ''by'' law" as opposed to "rule ''of'' law", meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Xiangming, Zhang. [http://www.international-relations.com/wbcm5-1/wbrule.htm On Two Ancient Chinese Administrative Ideas: Rule of Virtue and Rule by Law], ''The Culture Mandala: Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies'' (2002): “Although Han Fei recommended that the government should rule by law, which seems impartial, he advocated that the law be enacted by the lords solely. The lords place themselves above the law. The law is thereby a monarchical means to control the people, not the people's means to restrain the lords. The lords are by no means on an equal footing with the people. Hence we cannot mention the rule by law proposed by Han Fei in the same breath as democracy and the rule of law advocated today.”&lt;br /&gt;Bevir, Mark. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wVIoCtB3m74C&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=han+fei+zi+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1yB3TbGbDNLAgQfy2f2bDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Encyclopedia of Political Theory]'', page 162.&lt;br /&gt;Munro, Donald.

There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the [[Old Testament]], the book of [[Deuteronomy]] imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use).  According to Professor [[Bernard M. Levinson]], "This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented...."&lt;ref name=Levinson&gt;Levinson, Bernard.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=WjKFAkSEovgC&amp;pg=PA32 “National Identity as Commentary and as Metacommentary”], in ''Historiography and Identity (Re)formulation in Second Temple Historiographical Literature'', p. 32 (Jonker, ed.) (Continuum 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In [[Sharia|Islamic jurisprudence]] rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the [[caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Weeramantry|Weeramantry, Christopher]] (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-1sH1wc58UC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Justice+Without+Frontiers:+Furthering+Human+Rights%22&amp;ei=f1f-SbCnH5nCyASU38TvBw#PPA132,M1 Justice without Frontiers]'', p. 132 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not a reference to [[secular]] law, but to Islamic [[religious law]] in the form of [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impossible State: Islam, Politics and Modernity's Moral Predicament|last=Hallaq|first=Wael|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred the Great]], Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the [[Doom Book]]) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by [[Leviticus]] 19:15: "You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alter|first1=Robert|title=The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary|date=2004|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-01955-1|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215, Archbishop [[Stephen Langton]] gathered the Barons in England and forced [[John of England|King John]] and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by [[Magna Carta]] in return for exacting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/magnacarta/translation/mc_trans.html Magna Carta (1215) translation, British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/ Magna Carta (1297) U.S. National Archives].&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation for a constitution was carried into the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1481, during the reign of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the ''[[Constitució de l'Observança]]'' was approved by the [[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]], establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferro, Víctor: El Dret Públic Català.

===Early modern period===

{{Republicanism sidebar}}
The first known use of this English phrase occurred around AD 1500.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED), "[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry:showfullentry/true?redirectedFrom=%22Rule+of+Law%22&amp;t:ac=Entry/277614 Rule of Law, n.]", accessed April 27, 2013.  According to the OED, this sentence from about 1500  was written by [[John Blount (died 1531)|John Blount]]: "Lawes And constitutcions be ordeyned be cause the noysome Appetit of man maye be kepte vnder the Rewle of lawe by the wiche mankinde ys dewly enformed to lyue honestly."  And this sentence from 1559  is attributed to [[William Bavand]]: "A Magistrate should..kepe rekenyng of all mennes behauiours, and to be carefull, least thei despisyng the rule of lawe, growe to a wilfulnes."&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early example of the phrase "rule of law" is found in a petition to [[James I of England]] in 1610, from the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain ''rule of the law'' which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government....&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Hallam|Hallam, Henry]]. ''The Constitutional History of England'', vol. 1, p. 441 (1827).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1607, English Chief Justice [[Sir Edward Coke]] said in the ''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' (according to his own report) "that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, ''quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege'' (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.)."

Among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was [[Samuel Rutherford]] in ''[[Lex, Rex]]'' (1644).&lt;ref name=Rex&gt;Rutherford, Samuel.  ''Lex, rex: the law and the prince, a dispute for the just prerogative of king and people, containing the reasons and causes of the defensive wars of the kingdom of Scotland, and of their expedition for the ayd and help of their brethren of England'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpIBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Rutherford%22+and+%22but+under+rule+of+law%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3jZvY_yR6F&amp;sig=0t4WLPmw2ucho0R_mDqg9EJrKA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI_oLUzO6KxwIVRpUeCh3fnQj1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Rutherford%22%20and%20%22but%20under%20rule%20of%20law%22&amp;f=false p. 237] (1644): "The prince remaineth, even being a prince, a social creature, a man, as well as a king; one who must buy, sell, promise, contract, dispose: ergo, he is not regula regulans, but under rule of law...."&lt;/ref&gt; The title, Latin for "the law is king", subverts the traditional formulation ''rex lex'' ("the king is law").&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rule of Law|url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=3 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092303/http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] wrote in ''Oceana'' (1656), drawing principally on Aristotle’s ''Politics'', that among forms of government an “Empire of Laws, and not of Men” was preferable to an “Empire of Men, and not of Laws”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oceanaotherworks00harr|last=Harrington|first=James|title=The Oceana and other works|editor-last=Toland|editor-first=John|location=London|publisher=Millar|edition=3|year=1747|page=37 (Internet Archive: copy possessed by [[John Adams]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] also discussed this issue in his ''[[Second Treatise of Government]]'' (1690):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John.  [[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Civil Government]], Ch. IV, sec. 22 (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principle was also discussed by [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Tamanaha3"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p4CReF67hzQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Rule of Law]'', p. 47 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "rule of law" appears in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, Anthony Arthur, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eENm8IKECDYC&amp;dq= Freedom and the rule of law]'', p. 24. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that "in America, ''the law is king''. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ''ought'' to be king; and there ought to be no other."&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Jethro. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OmA8a1Q9UekC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;dq=%22so+in+free+countries+the+law+ought+to+be+king%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;ei=9lH-Sa-cEIXGzAS0hLm2Cw A Practical Companion to the Constitution]'', p. 436 (University of California Press 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[John Adams]] enshrined this principle in the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] by seeking to establish "a government of laws and not of men."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)|Massachusetts Constitution]]'', Part The First, art. XXX (1780).&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winks|first1=Robin W.|title=World civilization: a brief history|date=1993|publisher=Collegiate Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=9780939693283|page=406|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mY7McxJl7jYC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv-sKmzafMAhXBK8AKHbYhDrEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning and categorization of interpretations ==
The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has defined ''rule of law'' this way:&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by [[divine right of kings|divine right]].

Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as "an exceedingly elusive notion".&lt;ref name=elusive&gt;{{cite book|last=Tamanaha|first=Brian Z.|title=On the Rule of Law|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|page=3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among modern [[Legal theory#Legal theory|legal theorists]], one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a [[legal formalism|formalist]] or "thin" definition, and a substantive or "[[Thick concept|thick]]" definition; one occasionally encounters a third "functional" conception.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=312622# “The Rule of Law for Everyone?”], ''Current Legal Problems'', vol. 55, via [[SSRN]] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the "justness" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Paul P.|title=Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: An Analytical Framework|journal=Public Law|page=467|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared (prohibitions or exigencies), with prospective application (punishments or consequences tied to a given prohibition or exigency), and possess the characteristics of generality (usually meaning consistency and comprehensibility), equality (that is, applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (that is, certainty of application for a given situation), but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The "formal" interpretation is more widespread than the "substantive" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha" /&gt; This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of "rule of law" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights.

The substantive interpretation holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights.

The functional interpretation of the term "rule of law", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the "rule of law" with the "[[rule of man]]".&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;Stephenson, Matthew. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTLAWJUSTINST/0,,contentMDK:20763583~menuPK:1989584~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:1974062,00.html "Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy"], World Bank Research (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of "rule of law", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of "rule of law".&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt; Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are [[justification (law)|justifiable]] under [[natural law]] but not statutory law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Justifiably Punishing the Justified|author=Heidi M. Hurd|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=90|date=Aug 1992|pages=2203–2324|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1289573|issue=8|doi=10.2307/1289573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The ancient concept of rule ''of'' law can be distinguished from rule ''by'' law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: "The difference&amp;nbsp;... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian 2004).

The rule of law has been considered as one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and [[good governance]] of a country.&lt;ref name="Bank"&gt;Kaufman, Daniel et al.

===Europe===
The preamble of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] says "the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law".

In France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (''Etat de droit'' and ''Rechtsstaat'' respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see [[public law]]), particularly the [[legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pech|first1=Laurent|title=Rule of Law in France|journal=Middlesex University – School of Law|ssrn=929099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Letourneur|first1=M.|last2=Drago|first2=R.|title=The Rule of Law as Understood in France|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|date=1958|volume=7|issue=2|pages=147–177|doi=10.2307/837562|jstor=837562}}&lt;/ref&gt; France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peerenboom|first1=Randall|title=Asian discourses of rule of law : theories and implementation of rule of law in twelve Asian countries, France and the U.S.|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=9780415326124|page=81|edition=Digital printing.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCXJFFudGd0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Rule of Law in France}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German interpretation is more "rigid" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rule of Law in China: A Comparative Approach|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662446225|pages=77–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7gjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Zurn|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Nollkaemper|editor2-first=Andre|editor3-last=Peerenboom|editor3-first=Randy|title=Rule of Law Dynamics: In an Era of International and Transnational Governance|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139510974|pages=116–117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAAgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]] explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that "the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed."

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|Rule of law in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule of Law|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritemsruleoflaw.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=The rule of law and the prosecutor|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-rule-of-law-and-the-prosecutor|publisher=Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Albert Venn Dicey|A. V. Dicey]], a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the [[British constitution]] in his classic work ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and [[parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hostettler|title=Champions of the rule of law|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=9781904380689|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh7bCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibuqX19cfMAhVJ0xoKHY_QBYEQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dicey&amp;f=false|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===

====United States====
All government officers of the United States, including the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices of the Supreme Court]], state judges and legislators, and all [[United States Congress|members of Congress]], pledge first and foremost to uphold the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader.&lt;ref&gt;Vile, Josh (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-QXyUM5BhKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22rule+of+law%22+and+%22shall+be+a+law%22+and+constitution&amp;ots=7hOE4WdL4m&amp;sig=PRZ1TgZMRfRKQ-p0k-8skOzRF7I#PPA80,M1 A Companion to the United States Constitution and its Amendments]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its [[enumerated powers]] and respects the constitutionally protected [[United States Bill of Rights|rights of individuals]]. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of [[judicial discretion]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn v. Bank of the United States]'', 22 U. S. 738 (1824): "When [courts] are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it."&lt;/ref&gt; and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including [[prosecutorial discretion]].

Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the "rule of law", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word "law" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being "defined by formal or substantive criteria", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John. "Substantive Due Process and the Constitutional Text," ''[[Virginia Law Review]]'', vol. 83, p. 493 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Law Professor [[Frederick Mark Gedicks]] disagrees, writing that [[Cicero]], [[Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Gedicks|Gedicks, Frederick]]. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1072284 "An Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: Magna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the Fifth Amendment"], ''Emory Law Journal'', vol. 58, pp. 585–673 (2009). See also Edlin, Douglas, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1124590 Judicial Review without a Constitution]", ''Polity'', vol. 38, pp. 345–368 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by [[legal realism|legal realists]] such as [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].  For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: "The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''How an Instrumental View of Law Corrodes the Rule of Law'', twelfth annual Clifford Symposium on Tort Law and Social Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: "no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land." That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed "you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers." By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked "the ordinary legal manner" of the courts, further review of the facts by "the ordinary Courts of the land" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your "day in commission", the rule of law did not require a further "day in court". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Daniel R. (2014). ''Tocqueville's Nightmare: The Administrative State Emerges in America, 1900–1940''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0199920860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wilson]] said during the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 that, "Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect." [[George Mason]] agreed that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref&gt;Snowiss, Sylvia. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JUj81cN6nyAC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22could+declare+an+unconstitutional+%22+%22Laws+may+be+unjust,+may+be+unwise,+may+be+dangerous%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=P0P-Sa6jGI_CzASqtpzhDQ Judicial Review and the Law of the Constitution]'', pp. 41–42 (Yale University Press 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] (joined by Justice [[Joseph Story]]) took a similar position in 1827: "When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ogden v. Saunders'', {{ussc|25|213|1827|pin=347}}. This was Marshall's only dissent in a constitutional case. The [[individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]] later denounced Marshall for this part of his ''Ogden'' dissent. See {{cite book|first=Lysander|last=Spooner|title=Let's Abolish Government|publisher=Ludwig Von Mises Institute|year=2008|page=87}} These same issues were also discussed in an earlier U.S. Supreme Court case, ''Calder v. Bull'', {{ussc|3|386|1798}}, with Justices [[James Iredell]] and [[Samuel Chase]] taking opposite positions. See Presser, Stephen. "Symposium: Samuel Chase: In Defense of the Rule of Law and Against the Jeffersonians", ''[[Vanderbilt Law Review]]'', vol. 62, p. 349 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, [[Confucianism]], which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Yun-Han et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNk6KpfXyYQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+Law%22+and+Korea+and+Japan&amp;lr=&amp;ei=0NMASsrtG5XQzATy8KC8BA#PPA31,M1 How East Asians View Democracy]'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Awzar Thi, a member of the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]], the rule of law in Thailand, Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the police force is an organized crime gang. In Cambodia, judges are proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a decade?&lt;ref&gt;Thi, Awzar.

In countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, Randall ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], p. 39 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese law#Rule of law|rule of law in China]] has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China.

In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. Although the [[Constitution of India]] may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion, the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise [[Constitution of India#Judicial Review|judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Baxi, Upendra ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ#PPA336,M1 Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], pp. 336–337 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Indian journalist [[Harish Khare]], "The rule of law or rather the Constitution [is] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Simon. [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1556853,00.html "For Activist Judges, Try India"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'' (2006-11-08).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had centuries of tradition prior to [[World War II]], during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Carl. [http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html "Japan: 'The Rule of Law Without Lawyers' Reconsidered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623094753/http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html |date=2008-06-23 }}, Speech to the [[Asia Society]] (2001-03-14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F.|title=The rule of law in Japan : a comparative analysis|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9789041127501|edition=2nd rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIsmHbijQesC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.

=== The Council of Europe ===
[[Statute of the Council of Europe|The Statute]] of [[Council of Europe|the Council of Europe]] characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: "Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy." The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/1680306052|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Commission of Jurists===
In 1959, an event took place in [[New Delhi]] and speaking as the [[International Commission of Jurists]], made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the [[Declaration of Delhi]]. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, Jeffrey.

Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), ''Sceptical Essays on Human Rights'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] defines the rule of law as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=3 What is the Rule of Law?], United Nations Rule of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions.&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations General Assembly Resolutions A/RES/61/39, A/RES/62/70, A/RES/63/128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council debates S/PRST/2003/15, S/PRST/2004/2, S/PRST/2004/32, S/PRST/2005/30, S/PRST/2006/28.&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; children in armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1612.&lt;/ref&gt; and the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peacebuilding Commission]] has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml United Nations and the Rule of Law].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also requires the rule of law be included in [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] Part II, paragraph 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Bar Association===
The Council of the [[International Bar Association]] passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or "thick" definition of the rule of law:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=9925C6FD-5804-407F-9D39-ECB9D6A8B9D4 Resolution of the Council of the International Bar Association of October 8, 2009, on the Commentary on Rule of Law Resolution (2005)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World Justice Project===
As used by the [[World Justice Project]], a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjusticeproject.org About the WJP].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law;
# The laws are clear, publicized, stable, fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property;
# The process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient;
# Access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The [[World Justice Project#WJP Rule of Law Index|WJP Rule of Law Index]] is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law—such as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Agrast, M., Botero, J., Ponce, A., WJP [http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/wjproli2011_0.pdf Rule of Law Index 2011.] Washington, D.C.: The World Justice Project. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The International Development Law Organization (IDLO)===
The [[International Development Law Organization]] (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them.&lt;ref name="IDLO - What we Do"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDLO – What We Do|url=http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do|website=idlo.int|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan IDLO Strategic Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208164000/http://idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history IDLO Mission and History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do/rule-law IDLO – Rule of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in [[The Hague]] and has Permanent Observer Status at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York City.

=== The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) ===
The [http://inprol.org International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL)] is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective.  INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://inprol.org/about-inprol |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002311/http://inprol.org/about-inprol |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights.

INPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices.  Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues.

==In relation to economics==
One important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law’s impact on [[economic development]]. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter for economic development or not?&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. "Corruption and development. Does the 'rule of law' factor weigh more than we think?" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 15 Nov 2008. [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]], which, in many transitional and [[developing countries]], is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.

The standards of [[constitutional economics]] can be used during annual [[budget process]], and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, "Defining the rules", ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term "rule of law" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "rule of law" primarily connotes "protection of property rights".&lt;ref name=licht/&gt; The economist [[F. A. Hayek]] analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: "under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ''ad hoc'' action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts."&lt;ref name=Serfdom&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=F.A.|title=The Road to Serfdom|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-32061-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Brad|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|year=2016|title=Does Anti-bribery enforcement deter foreign investment?|url=http://fcpa.stanford.edu/academic-articles/20150511-does-anti-bribery-enforcement-deter-foreign-investment.pdf|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=|pages=63–67|via=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to culture==
The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or [[Roerich Pact]] is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935 by the representatives of 21 American states in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is [[intellectual property]]. Under the auspices of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant [[copyright infringement|piracy]], including an increase in [[peer-to-peer file sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=White Paper: Building a Culture of Respect for the Rule of Law|publisher=American Bar Association|author=Bica-Huiu, Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Russia, [[tax evasion]] is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/07-02_pope.pdf|title=The Rule of Law and Russian Culture – Are They Compatible?|author=Pope, Ronald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bribery]] likewise has different normative implications across cultures.&lt;ref name=licht&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=35|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=659–688|title=Culture rules: The foundations of the rule of law and other norms of governance|author=Licht, Amir N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Rule of Law has been criticised by several scholars, authors, philosophers and activists as unrealistic, hypocritical or dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Author [[Peter Gelderloos]] argues that attempting to create a specialised class of judicial authority that is separate from the community will inevitably lead to corruption. He points out that nonviolent drug-related offences receive far more police and media attention than workplace injuries or pollution, which kill far more people each year. He argues that [[restorative justice]] is a far more effective and humane alternative to prisons, courts and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scepticism in law''' is a school of [[jurisprudence]] that was a reaction against the idea of [[natural law]], and a response to the '[[Legal formalism|formalism]]' of [[legal positivism|legal positivists]]. Legal scepticism  is sometimes known as [[legal realism]].&lt;ref&gt;In the context of [[philosophy]], some people prefer the word '[[scepticism]]’ to 'realism'  because the word 'realism' is also used for school of thought founded by [[Plato]] and his followers. The reason for this preference for the use of word 'scepticism' is not only that this word is used in the writings of sceptic jurists themselves, but also that this word is suitable in the context of history of philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Posner, "The skeptical vein in American thinking about law runs from Holmes to the legal realists to the critical legal studies movement, while behind Holmes stretches a European skeptical legal tradition that runs from [[Thrasymachus]] (in Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]) to Hobbes and Bentham and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==

Scepticism is a [[philosophy| philosophical]] approach that includes a scientific method and a rejection of unevidenced claims to certainty. Scepticism has been known in various degrees. [[Pyrrho]] was the first philosopher who developed it to a high degree. Greek [[Sophist]] were also sceptics. [[Protagoras]] was a famous Greek Sophist. Greek Sophists were also law teachers.

Writing about the courts of Athenian democracy, [[Bertrand Russell]] states: "In general, there were a large number of judges to hear each case. The plaintiff and defendant, or prosecutor and accused, appeared in person, not through professional lawyers. Naturally, success or failure depended largely on oratorical skill in appealing to popular prejudices. Although a man had to deliver his own speech, he could hire an expert to write a speech for him, or, as many preferred, he could pay for instruction in the arts required for success in the law courts. These arts the Sophists were supposed to teach".&lt;ref&gt;History of Western Philosophy, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Stumpf writes about Sophists as, "It was their skepticism and relativism that made them suspect. No one would have criticized them for training lawyers, as they did, to be able to argue either side of a case" Philosophy, History &amp; Problems, p.&amp;nbsp;30. American legal sceptics are influenced by '[[pragmatism]]' of [[William James]], Dr. John Dewey, and F.e.S. Schiller.

Bertrand Russell declares that William James's doctrine is "an attempt to build a superstructure of belief upon a foundation of scepticism". One of the three founders of pragmatism, Schiller, considered himself a disciple of Protagoras. See &lt;ref&gt;Russell's History of Western Philosophy, p.94 and p.772.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the reasons for the preference of some people for the word 'scepticism'.

==Early history==

[[Mickey Dias]] writes: "a preliminary warning is needed against the tendency to imagine that there is anything like a 'school' of American realists. A difficulty in the way of a coherent presentation of their views is that there are varying versions of realism as well as changes of front; positions formerly defended with zest have since been forgotten or abandoned……. Judge Jerome Frank (1889–1957), a leading exponent preferred the phrases 'experimentalists' or 'constructive skeptics', He repudiated the charge that 'the realist school embraced fantastically inconsistent ideas' by pointing out that 'actually no such school existed'. The common bond is, in his words&lt;ref&gt;Law and the Modem Mind (first English edition, 1949), Preface, pp. vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt;
,'skepticism as to some of the conventional legal theories, a skepticism stimulated by a zeal to reform, in the interests of justice, some court-house ways. ",&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Jurisprudence, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
With such zeal to reform, legal sceptics made a revolt against the formalism.

Lord Lloyd of Hamstead has described this revolt in a wider philosophical perspective as follows:

"In the nineteenth and at the beginning of the present century, laissez-faire was the dominant creed in America. This creed was associated, in the intellectual sphere, with a certain attachment to what has been called "formalism" in philosophy and the social sciences. This was marked by a reverence for the role of logic and mathematics and a priori reasoning as applied to philosophy, economics and jurisprudence, with but little urge to link these empirically to the facts of life. Yet empirical science and technology were increasing dominating American society and with this development arose and intellectual movement in favor of treating philosophy and the social sciences, and even logic itself, as empirical studies not rooted in abstract formalism. In America this movement was associated with such figures as William James and Dewey in philosophy and logic. Veblen in economics, Beard and Robinson in historical studies, and Mr. Justice Holmes in [[jurisprudence]]. It is important to note that this movement was especially hostile to the so-called British empirical school derived from Hume, and to which [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Austin]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] adhered. For while it is true that these thinkers were positivist and anti-metaphysical they were for the anti-formalists, not empirical enough, since they were associated with a priori reasoning not based on actual study of the facts, such as Mill's formal logic and his reliance on an abstract "economic man," Bentham's hedonic calculus of pleasures and pains, and the analytical approach to jurisprudence derived from Austin. They were particularly critical of the ahistorical approach of the English utilitarians. Nor, unlike the sociologists of Pound persuasion, were they interested to borrow from Bentham such abstract analyses of society as his doctrine of conflicting to emphasise was the need to enlarge knowledge empirically, and to relate it to the solution of the practical problems of man in society at the present day., &lt;ref&gt;Lord Lloyd of Hamstead, Jurisprudence, 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new movement in jurisprudence found philosophical support of '[[Pragmatism]]'. The principal exponent of 'Pragmatism', William James, writes: "A pragmatist turns away from abstraction and insufficiencies, from verbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from fixed principles, closed systems and pretended absolutes and origins. He turns towards completeness and adequacy, towards facts, towards actions, towards powers.,,&lt;ref&gt;James, Pragmatism, (1925), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.==
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]]]
This sceptical approach impressed Justice Holmes, who laid the foundation of healthy and constructive scepticism in the law. Hughes writes: "Though another half century was to elapse before the appearance of Ogden and Richard's The Meaning of Meaning, exploration of meaning of meaning of law was Holmes's pioneer enterprise.,,&lt;ref&gt;Charles. Hughes, "Early Writing of Holmes, Jr.", in 44&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes further writes: " To me, Mr. Justice Holmes is a prophet of the Law,&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Law Review (1930-31), at p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] was graduated from Harvard Law School in 1866, and opened a private law practice. He devoted most of his energies to legal scholarship. From 1870 to 1873 he served as editor of the American Law Review and taught constitutional law at Harvard.

In 1881, Holmes published ''The Common Law'', representing a new departure in legal philosophy. He changed the attitude of the law through his writings. The opening sentence captures the pragmatic theme of that work and of Holmes's philosophy of law: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. " As a justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. was well known for the eloquence, pungency, and abundance of his dissenting opinions––so much so that he was called the "Great Dissenter." Holmes was appointed justice in 1902, and served the Court for thirty years. At that time, many state regulatory laws were being declared unconstitutional because the Court felt they did not conform to its concept of due process of law.

In a dissenting opinion in ''Lochner v. New York'' (1905)&lt;ref name="198 US 45,76 1905"&gt;198 U.S. 45,76 (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes declared that the law should develop along with society and that the 14th Amendment did not deny states a right to experiment with social legislation. He also argued for judicial restraint, asserting that the Court should not interpret the Constitution according to its own social philosophy. Speaking for a unanimous Court in ''Schenck v. United States'' (1919), however, he stated that judicial review was necessary in cases involving Freedom and Speech and presented the "clear and present danger" doctrine associated with his name. Francis Biddle writes: ''He was convinced that one who administers constitutional law should multiply his skepticisms to avoid heading into vague words like liberty, and reading into law his private convictions or the prejudices of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, Justice Holmes, Natural law, and the Supreme Court, (1960), p.lO. Biddle also tells usthat Holmes ,"refused to let his preferences (other men were apt to call them convictions) interfere with his judicial decisions……	The steadily held determination to keep his own vies isolated from his professional work is aptly shown by his famous remark in the Lochner case-the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statistics….	A constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory." P.IO. It is importantto note that eighty years after Lochner case (1905), Human Right Commission of Pakistan recommended that, "the confusion caused by conflict between normal Iaws and belief  which does not enjoy the force of law) needs to be removed." See, State of Human Rights in 1996, at p. 46, Human Right Commission of Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Holmes, 'men make their own laws; that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that judges are not independent mouthpieces of the infinite.,&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, Justice Holmes, Natural Law and the Supreme Court, (1960) p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; 'The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky'.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Pac. Co. V. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (dissent).&lt;/ref&gt; Law should be viewed 'from the stance of the bad man'.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"&gt;Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harvard Law Review (1897) 457&lt;/ref&gt;
'The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law'.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt; A judge must be aware of social facts. Only a judge or lawyer who is acquainted with the historical, social, and economic aspects of the law will be in a position to fulfill his functions properly.

As a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Holmes introduced a new method of constitutional interpretation. He challenged the traditional concept of constitution. Holmes also protested against the method of abstract logical deduction from general rules in the judicial process. According to Holmes, lawyers and judges are not logicians and mathematicians. The books of the laws are not books of logic and mathematics. He writes: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, and even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed.

The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics., &lt;ref&gt;Holmes, The Common Law,1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Lochner v. New York''&lt;ref name="198 US 45,76 1905"/&gt; he observes that, 'General propositions do not decide concrete cases."

Holmes, also insisted on the separation of 'ought' and 'is' which are obstacles in understanding the realities of the law. As an ethical sceptic, Holmes tells us that if you want to know the real law, and nothing else, you must consider it from the point of view of 'bad man' who cares only from material consequences of the courts' decisions, and not from the point of view of good man, who find his reasons for conduct "in the vaguer sanctions of his conscience.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt; The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and talks about rights and duties, malice, intent, and negligence- and nothing is easier in legal reasoning than to take these words in their moral sense.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Biddle. Justice Holmes, Natural Law, and the Supreme Court. 40 332 p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes said: "I think our morally tinted words have caused a great deal of confused thinking. But Holmes is not unconcerned with moral question. He writes: "The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When I emphasize the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt;

==Jerome Frank==

[[Jerome New Frank]] followed Holmes scepticism, and made an elaborate system of legal scepticism. He considered himself to be 'a constructive sceptic'. He challenged the traditional conception that law consists of rules from which deductions are made. He called that conception a 'basic myth of law'. He argued that it is fruitless to seek such certainty, that the law is uncertain and that the law cannot be separated from decisions of the courts.

Frank argues that every legal controversy is unique and may not be decided by rigid universals and abstract generalizations. He calls those jurists who find legal uncertainty within the laws's formal rules 'Rule-sceptics', and those who find legal uncertainty arising from the nature of facts 'Fact-sceptics'. Dias writes: "Frank divided realists into two camps, described as 'rule skeptics' and 'fact skeptic'. The 'rule skeptics' rejected legal rules as providing uniformity in law, and tried instead to find uniformity in rules evolved out of psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, politics, etc. [[Hans Kelsen]], it will be remembered, maintained that it is not possible to derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. The 'rule skeptics' avoided that criticism by saying that they were not deriving purposive 'oughts', but only predictions of judicial behaviour analogous to the laws of science. Frank called this brand realism the left-wing adherents of a right-wing traditions, namely, the tradition of trying to find uniformity in rules. They, too, had to account for uncertainty in the law on the basis of rule-uncertainty. The 'fact skeptics', among them Frank, rejected even this aspiration towards uniformity. So he abandoned all attempts to seek rule-certainty and pointed to the uncertainty of establishing even the facts in trial courts. These have to be established largely by witnesses, who are fallible and who may be lying. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty how fallible a particular witness is likely to be, or how persuasively he will lie. All persons, judges and jurymen alike, form different impressions of the dramas unfolded before them; an inflexion or a cough may awaken subconscious predilections, varied idiosyncrasies and prejudices. Eternal verities are not to be erected on such a basis. Frank alleged that all those who write on [[legal certainty]], not excepting the 'rule skeptics', over look these difficulty. 'They often call their writings 'jurisprudence'; but as they almost never consider juries and jury-trials, one might chide them for forgetting jurisprudence. ",&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Jurisprudence, p.624. see also, Law and the Modem Mind (1930), Preface, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
"For any particular lay person", Frank writes: "the law, with respect to any particular set of facts, is a decision of a court with respect to those facts so far as that decision affects that particular person. Until a court has passed on those facts no law on that subject is yet in existence. ,&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Law and the Modem Mind'' (1930), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix Frankfurter, who wrote book "Mr. Justice Holmes and the Supreme Court" published three years after the death of Holmes, observes in ''Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Ry. V. Browning''&lt;ref&gt;310 U.S. 362, 369 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; that: "It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of 'laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it."

Statutes and constitutions are inanimate object which cannot speak by themselves. [[John Chipman Gray]], the great American Jurist, who reiterated Holmes's view, writes: "Statutes do not interpret themselves; their meaning is declared by the courts, and it is with the meaning declared by the courts, and with no other meaning, that they are imposed upon the community as law. ,&lt;ref&gt;Jhon Chipman Gray, The Nature and Sources of the Law. (1909), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He further writes: "It has been sometime said that the Law is composed of two parts,-legislative law and judge-made law, but, in truth all the Law is judge-made law. The shape in which a statute is imposed on the community as a guide for conduct is that statute as interpreted by the courts. The courts put life into the dead words of the statute. 339 To quote from Bishop Hoadly.......'Nay, whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws, it is He who is truly the law Giver to all intents and purposes, and not who first who wrote and spoke them”.

The '''smoking age''' is the minimum legal age required to purchase or smoke [[tobacco]] products. Most countries have laws that restrict those below a minimum age from legally purchasing tobacco products.

The federal law requires states to have a minimum age of 18 years for sale/purchase of tobacco products (21 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;387f. (3)(a)(ii)). State and local laws may extend this ban and also prohibit supply, possession and consumption to/by person underage, or increase the age beyond 18. However, most states do not directly ban the consumption of tobacco by a minor. The federal law requiring states to have a minimum purchasing age at 18 is enforced by withholding [[FEMA]] disaster and non-disaster grants from states that have purchasing ages under 18, and currently no state falls under that category.

A '''talking shop''' or '''debating society''' is an organisation or place where discussion is the main activity, with no decisions or actions necessarily arising from the discussion.  Talking shops may be considered unproductive, [[bureaucratic]] or self-serving and so may lack respect and power. The term "debating society" is considered derisive.

The term 'Talking shop' is usually used in a pejorative or derogatory sense; apparently fruitless discussion forums are often dismissed as talking shops.

The term has been applied to many political forums, including [[supranational]] bodies such as the [[League of Nations]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Parliament]], [[European Political Cooperation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd5d1CwtI7cC&amp;pg=PA200 |title=Community and communication |author=Sue Wright |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ASEAN]], the [[Organisation of African Unity]] or [[devolved]] and [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] bodies such as the [[National Assembly for Wales]] or the [[regions of England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36994">'''Transitional justice''' consists of judicial and non-judicial measures implemented in order to redress legacies of [[human rights]] abuses.  Such measures "include [[criminal prosecution]]s, [[truth commission]]s, [[reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] programs, and various kinds of [[institutional reform]]s".&lt;ref name=ictj&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Transitional Justice?|url=http://ictj.org/about/transitional-justice|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional justice is enacted at a point of political transition from violence and repression to societal stability and it is informed by a society’s desire to rebuild [[Trust (social sciences)|social trust]], repair a fractured justice system, and build a [[Democracy|democratic]] system of governance. The core value of transitional justice is the very notion of justice—which does not necessarily mean criminal justice. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict are thus linked toward a more peaceful, certain, and democratic future.

Transitional justice has recently received greater attention by both academics and policymakers. It has also generated interest in the fields of political and legal discourse, especially in transitional societies. In period of political transitions, from authoritarian, dictatorial regimes or from civil conflicts to democracy, transitional justice has often provided opportunities for such societies to address past human rights abuses, mass atrocities, or other forms of severe trauma in order to facilitate a smooth transition into a more democratic or peaceful future.

==History==
The origins of the transitional justice field can be traced back to the post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] period in [[Europe]] with the establishment of the [[International Military Tribunal]] at [[Nuremberg]] and the various [[de-Nazification]] programs in [[Germany]] and the trials of [[Japan]]ese soldiers at Tokyo Tribunal. What became known as the "[[Nuremberg Trials]]", when the victorious allied forces extended criminal justice to Japanese and German soldiers and their leaders for [[war crimes]] committed during the war, marked the genesis of transitional justice. The field gained momentum and coherence during the 1980s and onwards, beginning with the trials of former members of the military juntas in [[Greece]] (1975), and [[Argentina]] ([[Trial of the Juntas]], 1983). The focus of transitional justice in the 1970s and 1980s was on criminal justice with a focus on [[human rights]] promotion. This led to a worldwide focus and progressive rise of human rights regime culminating in the establishments of international human rights laws and conventions.

The emphasis of transitional justice was on how abuses of human rights get treated during political transition: legal and criminal prosecution. As noted earlier, the universal conceptions of "justice" became the platform on which transitional justice was premised. The field in its early [[epistemology]], thus, assumed jurisprudence of human rights. As a result, the initial literature on transitional justice was dominated by lawyers, law, and legal rights: defining laws, and processes on how to deal with human rights abuse and holding people accountable. Thus, transitional justice has its roots in both the human rights movement and in international human rights and humanitarian law. These origins in the human rights movement have rendered transitional justice “self-consciously victim-centric”.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a shift in the focus of transitional justice. Informed by the worldwide wave of democratization, particularly the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]], transitional justice reemerged as a new field of study in democratization. Transitional justice broadened its scope from more narrow questions of [[jurisprudence]] to political considerations of developing stable democratic institutions and renewing civil society. Studies by scholars on the transition from autocratic regimes to democratic ones have integrated the transitional justice framework into an examination of the political processes inherent to democratic change. The challenges of democratization in transitional periods are many: settling past accounts without derailing democratic progress, developing judicial or third-party fora capable of resolving conflicts, reparations, and creating memorials and developing educational curricula that redress cultural lacunae and unhealed trauma.

It is clear that elements of transitional justice have broken the initial mold of post-war jurisprudence. The transitional justice framework has benefited from democratic activists who sought to bolster fledgling democracies and bring them into line with the moral and legal obligations articulated in the international human rights consensus.

One particular innovation is the appearance of [[truth commission]]s. Beginning with Argentina in 1983, Chile in 1990, and South Africa in 1995, truth commissions have become a symbol of transitional justice, appearing in transitional societies in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. However, several attempts to create a regional truth commission in the former [[Yugoslavia]] (REKOM) have failed due to political obstacles. Recent years have also seen proposals for truth and reconciliation commissions in conflict zones of the Middle East and it is likely that these transitional justice institutions will someday figure prominently in [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[Kurdistan|Kurdish region]]s.{{or|date=September 2015}}

Another major institutional innovation is the appearance of the variety of [[lustration]] programs in Central and Eastern Europe since the 1990s. While most countries pursued programs based on dismissals of compromised personnel and comprehensive screening tools, other countries implemented more inclusive methods allowing discredited personnel a second chance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14845.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As a link between transition and justice, the concept of transitional justice transformed in the late 1940s to assume a broader perspective of comprehensive examination of the society in transition from a retrospective to a prospective position with democratic consolidation as one of the primary objectives. Scholars and practitioners of democratization have come to a common conclusion on the general principles of a transitional justice framework: that national strategies to confront past abuses, depending on the specific nature and context of the country in question, can contribute to accountability, an end to impunity, reconstruct state–citizen relations, and the creation of democratic institutions.

==Objectives==
The primary objective of a transitional justice policy is to end the culture of [[impunity]] and establish the rule of law in a context of democratic governance. The legal and human rights protection roots of transitional justice impute certain legal obligations on states undergoing transitions. It challenges such societies to strive for a society where respect for human rights is the core and accountability is routinely practiced as the main goals. In the context of these goals, transitional justice aims at:

* Halting ongoing human rights abuses;
* Investigating past crimes;
* Identifying those responsible for human rights violations;
* Imposing sanctions on those responsible (where it can);
* Providing reparations to victims;
* Preventing future abuses;
* Security Sector Reform;
* Preserving and enhancing peace; and
* Fostering individual and national reconciliation.

In general, therefore, one can identify eight broad objectives that transitional justice aims to serve: establishing the truth, providing victims a public platform, holding perpetrators accountable, strengthening the rule of law, providing victims with compensation, effectuating institutional reform, promoting reconciliation, and promoting public deliberation.

==Strategies==
In order to be effective, transitional justice measures should be part of a holistic approach. There are five broad strategies or forms of transitional justice:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-transitional-justice "What is Transitional Justice?"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; 1) Criminal prosecutions, 2) Truth commissions, 3) Reparation programs, 4) Security sector reform, 5) Memorialization efforts. The needs of the survivors are essential and including gender justice is necessary to ensure women have equal access to the mechanisms.

==Prosecutions==
{{main|International criminal law}}
The investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes, such as [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crimes]] helps to strengthen the rule of law by sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties. It also demonstrates that crime will not be tolerated, and that human rights abusers will be held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/criminal-justice "Criminal Justice"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; From its historical roots in the [[Nuremberg Trials]], recent examples have included [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], hybrid courts such as [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], [[Special Panels of the Dili District Court]], [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]], [[Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), assuming a [[universal jurisdiction]]. The ICC and Hybrid Courts/Tribunals are key components of prosecution initiatives:

===International Criminal Court===

{{main|International Criminal Court}}
The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] in 1998. It is the first international criminal court that helps end impunity for perpetrators of severe crimes. It was established to investigate and try leaders of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in cases where countries are unable or unwilling to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/Transitions-June-2010 "Transitions June 2010: Transitional Justice News From Around the World"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid courts and tribunals===

Hybrid courts and tribunals have emerged as “third generation” courts established to investigate and prosecute human rights offenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://pict-pcti.org/courts/hybrid.html&lt;/ref&gt; They follow the “first generation” Nuremberg and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo tribunals]] and the “second generation” International Criminal Court and International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia ([[ICTY]]) and Rwanda ([[ICTR]]). These courts consist of both international and domestic justice actors. They attempt to deliver justice that the domestic justice systems cannot provide alone due to lack of capacity or political will. Furthermore, hybrid courts attempt to strengthen domestic capacities to prosecute human rights abuses through the transfer of international legal skills and expertise. Examples include the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] and the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/where-here-international-tribunals "Where to From Here for International Tribunals?"], Caitlin Reiger, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; A step beyond within a more societal and traditional scope of justice could be the [[Gacaca]] for Rwanda.

===Reparations===
{{main|Reparations (transitional justice)}}
Reparations aim to repair the suffering of victims of human rights abuses. They seek to make amends with victims, help them overcome the consequences of abuse, and provide rehabilitation. They may include financial payments, social services including health care or education, or symbolic compensation such as public apologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/reparations-theory-and-practice "Reparations in Theory and Practice"], Lisa Margarrell, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the Canadian government’s apology “Statement of Reconciliation” to indigenous Canadian families for removing their children and placing them in church-run Indian Residential Schools. The Canadian government also created a $350&amp;nbsp;million fund to help those affected by the schools.

===Truth-seeking===
{{main|Truth-seeking}}
Truth-seeking encompasses initiatives allowing actors in a country to investigate past abuses and seek redress for victims. These processes aim to enable societies to examine and come to terms with past crimes and [[human rights]] violations in order to prevent their recurrence. They help create documentation that prevents repressive regimes from rewriting history and denying the past. They can also help victims obtain closure by knowing the truth about what actually happened (such as to “disappeared” people) and understanding the atrocities they endured. Truth-seeking measures may include [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information legislation]], declassification of archives, investigations, and truth commissions.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory  "Truth and Memory"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Truth commissions====
{{main|Truth commissions}}
Truth commissions are non-judicial commissions of inquiry that aim to discover and reveal past abuses by a government or non-state actors; about forty official truth commissions have been created worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/truth-commissions  "Truth Commissions"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa]], which was established to help overcome apartheid and reconcile tensions in the country.

===Memory and memorials===
{{main|Memorialization}}
Memorials seek to preserve memories of people or events. In the context of transitional justice, they serve to honor those who died during conflict or other atrocities, examine the past, address contemporary issues and show respect to victims. They can help create records to prevent denial and help societies move forward. Memorials may include commemoration activities, such as architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"/&gt; One example includes the monuments, annual prayer ceremony, and mass grave in northern [[Uganda]], created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/we-can%E2%80%99t-be-sure-who-killed-us-memory-and-memorialization-post-conflict-northern-uganda  "We Can’t Be Sure Who Killed Us: Memory and Memorialization in Post-conflict Northern Uganda"], Julian Hopwood, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional reform===
{{main|Security sector reform}}
Public institutions, including the [[police]], [[military]], and [[judiciary]], often contribute to repression and other human rights violations. When societies undergo a transition, these institutions must be reformed in order to create accountability and prevent the recurrence of abuse. Institutional reform includes the process of restructuring these state actors to ensure that they respect human rights and abide by the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/institutional-reform "Institutional Reform"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms can include measures such as [[vetting]], [[lustration]], and [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration]] (DDR). Vetting is the process of eliminating corrupt or abusive officials from public service employment. For instance, in [[Afghanistan]], election candidates in the 2009 and 2010 elections were vetted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/vetting-lessons-2009-10-elections-afghanistan "Vetting Lessons for the 2009-10 Elections in Afghanistan"], Fatima Ayub, Antonella Deledda, Patricia Gossman, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; While similar to lustration, "vetting" is the broader category referring to processes aimed at screening and excluding human rights abusers from public institutions while "lustration" refers specifically to the vetting processes and laws that were implemented in the former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe after the end of  the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/justice-prevention-vetting-public-employees-transitional-societies "Justice as Prevention: Vetting Public Employees in Transitional Societies"], eds. Pablo de Greiff and Alexander Mayer-Rieckh, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; Vetting does not necessarily imply dismissals from the state apparatus. Several countries developed alternative personnel systems that provide for the inclusion of inherited personnel in exchange for their exposure or confession.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, David, ''Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; DDR programs assist ex‑combatants in rejoining society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/research/disarmament-demobilization-and-reintegration "Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of institutional reform is the removal of court officials involved in crimes of the fallen Tunisian regime. Under [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]’s rule, courts often facilitated corruption. The removal of implicated officials is a part of the government’s efforts to reconcile this abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/news/tunisias-courts-emerge-slowly-shadow-ben-ali "Tunisia's courts Emerge Slowly from Shadow of Ben Ali"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends and challenges==
States in times of transition to democracy, since the early 1980s, have been using a variety of transitional justice mechanisms as part of measures to account for the past and build a future democratic state. Mechanisms, such as trials, truth commissions, reparations, lustration, museums, and other memory sites have been employed either single-handedly or in a combined form to address past human rights violations. Diverse studies ranging from the decision-making process of a choice of strategy through to the implementation of the transitional justice policy and impacts on the transition and future stability of the society in question have been produced by scholars in recent years. One illuminating study in particular that has documented the dramatic new trend of transitional justice and democratization is by Kathryn Sikkink and Carrie Booth Walling (2006). In their research paper described as the "justice cascade", Sikkink and Walling conducting analysis of truth commissions and human rights trials occurring throughout the world from 1979 to 2004 revealed a significant increase in the judicialization of world politics both regionally and internationally. Of the 192 countries surveyed, 34 have used truth commissions, and 50 had at least one transitional human rights trial.

More than two-thirds of the approximately 85 new and/or transitional countries during that period used either trials or truth commissions as a transitional justice mechanism; over half tried some form of judicial proceedings. Thus, the use of a truth commission and/or human rights trials among transitional countries is not an isolated or marginal practice, but a widespread social practice occurring in the bulk of transitional countries.

Since its emergence, transitional justice has encountered numerous challenges such as identifying victims, deciding whether to punish superiors or middle agents, avoiding a "victor’s justice", and finding adequate resources for compensation, trial, or institutional reform. Also, the transitional period may only result in a tenuous peace or fragile democracy. As has been noted in the discourse on transition to democracy, the dilemma has always been for new regimes to promote accountability for past abuses without risking a smooth transition to democracy. In addition, existing judicial system might be weak, [[Political corruption|corrupt]], or ineffective and in effect make achieving any viable justice difficult. Observers of transitional justice application and processes, such as [[Makau W. Mutua]] (2000) emphasized on the difficulties of achieving actual justice through one of the most prominent mechanisms of transitional justice, trials. Commenting on the international tribunal established in [[Rwanda]] in 1994, he argued that it “serves to deflect responsibility, to assuage the consciences of states which were unwilling to stop the [[genocide]]... [and] largely masks the illegitimacy of the [[Tutsi]] regime”. In sum, Matua argues that criminal tribunals such as those in Rwanda and Yugoslavia are “less meaningful if they cannot be applied or enforced without prejudice to redress transgressions or unless they have a deterrent effect such as behavior modification on the part of would be perpetrators”.

More recently, [[Lyal S. Sunga]] has argued that unless truth commissions are set up and conducted according to international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, they risk conflicting or undermining criminal prosecutions, whether these prosecutions are supposed to be carried out at the national or international levels. He contends that this risk is particularly pronounced where truth commissions employ amnesties, and especially blanket amnesties to pardon perpetrators of serious crimes. On the other hand, criminal prosecutions should be better tailored to focus on victims and to place events in proper perspective.  Sunga therefore proposes ten principles for making truth and national reconciliation commissions fully complementary to criminal prosecutions in a way that conforms fully to international law.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Principles for Reconciling Truth Commissions and Criminal Prosecutions, in ''The Legal Regime of the ICC'', Brill (2009) 1071–1104.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of critique of transitional justice mechanisms could cause some scholars and policymakers to wonder which of the objectives outlined above are most important to achieve, and even if they are achievable. Truth commissions could be characterized as a second-best alternative and also an affront to rule of law, because of the possibility that amnesty and indemnities will be made exchange for truth. These sets of challenges can raise critical questions for transitional justice in its application. Questions and issues, such as: Can the "truth" ever really be established? Can all victims be given compensation or a public platform? Can all perpetrators be held accountable? Or is it sufficient to acknowledge that atrocities were committed and that victims should be compensated for their suffering?

Also, one might argue that too narrow a focus on the challenges of the field runs the risk of making transitional justice seem meaningless. However transitional justice aims at an ongoing search for truth, justice, forgiveness, and healing, and efforts undertaken within it help people to live alongside former enemies. Simply put, “the past must be addressed in order to reach the future”. Thus, even if the impact or reach of transitional justice seems marginal, the end result is worth the effort.

Another way of assessing attempts at transitional justice is to say that decision makers may have less control over the methods used to pursue such policies than they imagine. In fact, whatever their wishes, they may not be able to prevent such policies at all. As A.&amp;nbsp;James McAdams has demonstrated in his book, ''Judging the Past in Unified Germany'' (2001), West German policymakers such as former chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] wanted to close public access to the files of East Germany's secret police, the [[Stasi]], but pressures from East German dissidents prevented them from doing so.

Another challenge is the tension between peace and justice, which arises the conflicting goals of achieving peace and justice in the aftermath of a society’s emergence from conflict. Though it is generally unanimous that both goals are integral to achieving reconciliation, practitioners often disagree about which goal should be pursued first: justice or peace?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104175556/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the “justice” school of thought argue that if all perpetrators of human rights abuses do not stand trial, impunity for crimes will continue into the new regime, preventing it from fully completing a transition from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/18/seductions-sequencing&lt;/ref&gt; The "peace" school of thought, however, argues that the only way to effectively end violence is by granting amnesties and brokering negotiations to persuade criminals to lay down their arms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/744] Examples such as [[Northern Ireland]] illustrate how selective amnesties can cease conflict.

Recent trends in the post-conflict field have tended to favor the “justice” school of thought, maintaining that only if justice is dutifully served to victims of the conflict can civil war will be prevented from recurring. A 2011 debate in ''[[The Economist]]'' determined in its concluding polls that 76% of the debate participants agreed with the motion that achieving peace can occur only through implementing justice mechanisms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/747]

=== Literary Applications ===
Literary scholars and historians have begun to use the concept of transitional justice to reexamine historical events and texts. Christopher N. Warren, for instance, has applied transitional justice to pre-[[Restoration England]], claiming that it helps explain how Anglican royalists convinced Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren also argues that English poet [[John Milton]] “can be seen as an early critic of transitional justice,” using the allegory of Sin and Death in his epic poem [[Paradise Lost]] to complicate “overly-rosy” depictions of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''. p. 5, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future agenda==
Although transitional justice is engulfed by many critical challenges in addition to the difficulty in measuring its impact, given the number of other factors in any given country’s experience over time, human rights trials or truth commissions need not have a negative effect on human rights practices. This makes transitional justice viable, especially in this age of state-building and democracy promotion in post-conflict societies. In fact, Sikkink and Walling’s comparison of human rights conditions before and after trials in [[Latin America]]n countries with two or more trial years showed that eleven of the fourteen countries had better Political Terror Scale (PTS) ratings after trials. Latin American countries that had both a truth commission and human rights trials improved more on their PTS ratings than countries that only had trials. These statistics indicate that transitional justice mechanisms are associated with countries’ improving their human rights practices. Each state that employs transitional justice mechanisms will have to determine which mechanisms to use to best achieve the targeted goals. In order to avoid causing disappointment amongst victims, the state should also ensure that the public is well-informed about the goals and limits of those mechanisms.

Transitional justice shows no signs of decreasing in use. Indeed, the incorporation of transitional justice policies, tools and programs in peacebuilding and democratization process operations by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and in the programs by many local and international democracy promotion organizations, including, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Electoral Assistance and Democracy (International IDEA) and a host of others as well as the establishments of other international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and networks such as the [http://www.ictj.org International Center for Transitional Justice] (ICTJ) and the  [http://www.transitionaljustice.net African Transitional Justice Research Network] (ATJRN) and research centers like the [[Transitional Justice Institute]] are strong manifestations of how well placed transitional justice has become a feature in the discourse of transitional politics in the 21st century. Academic publications such as the [http://www.ijtj.oxfordjournals.org International Journal of Transitional Justice] are also contributing towards building an interdisciplinary field with the hope that future innovations are tailored for a specific state’s situation and will contribute towards political transitions that address the past as well as establish guarantees for respect of human rights and democracy.

The [[World Bank]]'s "2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security, and Development” links transitional justice to security and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/human-rights-and-transitional-justice-2011-world-development-report "Human Rights and Transitional Justice in the 2011 World Development Report"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; It explores how countries can avoid cycles of violence and emphasizes the importance of transitional justice, arguing that it is one of the “[[Signalling (economics)|signaling mechanisms]]” that governments can use to show that they are breaking away from past practices. It also argues that transitional justice measures can send signals about the importance of accountability and to improve institutional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext "Conflict, Security, and Development"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514143518/http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext |date=2011-05-14 }}, ''World Development Report 2011''&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) published a report advocating the need to understand traditional transitional justice measures from a child's perspective. The report identifies children as a large demographic too often excluded from traditional transitional justice measures. In order to correct this imbalance, a new child-centered perspective is needed to incorporate children into the larger scope of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/through-new-lens-child-sensitive-approach-transitional-justice "Through A New Lens: A Child-Sensitive Approach to Transitional Justice"], "International Center for Transitional Justice"&lt;/ref&gt;
